1,PM-1,Adi et al. (2025),2025,"Management of a complex multiligament knee injury: Simultaneous reconstruction of ACL, PCL, and both meniscal roots","INTRODUCTION: Multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs) can lead to severe complications like early osteoarthritis and functional loss. Meniscal root tears further increase these risks. This study reports the first documented case of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and dual meniscal root injuries, emphasizing the unique surgical and rehabilitative challenges involved. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 19-year-old male presented with persistent knee pain and instability seven months after a traumatic injury from a major fall. Examination revealed a range of motion of 0-120 degrees, no swelling or tenderness, but a positive recurvatum over 10 degrees, indicating significant instability. Lachman's, McMurray's, pivot shift, and both anterior and posterior drawer tests were positive. DISCUSSION: The radiography of the right knee revealed no fractures. The MRI confirmed injuries to the ACL, PCL, and the posterior roots of both the lateral and medial menisci. The patient received surgical intervention. Grafts were obtained: the peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and a hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The ACL and PCL reconstructions were subsequently performed utilizing an all-inside technique, and both posterior roots of the lateral and medial menisci were repaired. Postoperative care included knee immobilization and a progressive rehabilitation program. CONCLUSION: Effective management of multiple ligament knee injuries necessitates a comprehensive approach, including precise identification and treatment of all torn ligaments, accurate graft placement, and robust fixation. Simultaneous reconstruction reduces hospital stays, anaesthesia exposure, and surgical risks while streamlining rehabilitation, enabling quicker patient recovery and improved outcomes.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111150,
2,PM-2,Almeida and Livet (2025),2025,Effect of Cranial Cruciate Ligament Transection during TPLO on Patellar Desmitis in Dogs with Partial Cranial Cruciate Ligament Rupture,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the protective effect of transecting a partially ruptured cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) during tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO) surgery on postoperative patellar ligament thickness (PLT) and shortening. STUDY DESIGN: Dogs with partial CCL rupture that underwent a unilateral TPLO were included. The population was divided into two groups: remnant CCL transected (study group) and left in situ (control group). Preoperative and 6-week postoperative measurements of PLT, in three specific locations, and patellar ligament length (PLL) were collected. Risk factors for PLT and shortening were also included. RESULTS: Fifty-two dogs (56 stifles) with partial CCL rupture were retrospectively included. Twenty-nine stifles (51.8%) had the remnant CCL transected (study group) and 27 stifles (48.2%) had the remnant CCL left in situ (control group). Significant differences were found on PLT measurements between pre- and 6-week post-surgery for all three ligament locations with greatest difference at the middle region. Median PLL was significantly shorter 6-week post-surgery for both groups. No significant differences in PLT nor PLL were identified between procedures where the remnant was transected or not. CONCLUSION: This study did not identify a protective effect of transecting the CCL remnant on PLT or patellar ligament shortening, contrary to other reports within the literature. Further investigation is needed in the form of prospective studies with higher number of cases to understand the clinical implications of patellar ligament thickening and shortening in dogs.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1055/s-0044-1795088,
3,PM-3,Arora et al. (2025),2025,Peroneus Longus to Peroneus Brevis Tenodesis Does Not Improve Ankle Functional Outcomes: A Prospective Cohort Study,"PURPOSE: Peroneus longus (PL) graft harvest has recently gained popularity for various ligament reconstruction surgeries. A recent systematic review shows it is a safe and reproducible technique with low morbidity of donor sites (1). The method for PL harvest routinely involves tenodesis of the PL stump to the peroneus brevis (PB). To the authors' best knowledge, no study exists in the literature that has compared the outcomes of tenodesis versus no tenodesis on post-operative ankle functional outcome scores. The purpose of the present study is to assess the importance of tenodesis on post-operative ankle scores. METHODS: A total of 200 consecutive patients from July 2022 to November 2022 were included in the study: 72 in the no tenodesis group and 128 in the tenodesis group. Institutional ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics review committee before the initiation of the study. Demographic variables (age, gender and level of play) were recorded. Pre-operative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) and Functional Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were calculated for both groups and compared with post-operative scores at six weeks, three months, six months and one-year follow-up. RESULTS: For the entire study population (n?=?200), we found that AOFAS and FADI scores showed no significant difference at any interval except for lower scores at six weeks of follow-up for both groups compared to baseline. We found that the no tenodesis group had slightly better AOFAS and FADI scores at the six-week follow-up, which were statistically significant (p?<?0.05). However, the magnitude of variance (0.13 and 0.20, respectively) was too small to be clinically significant. Age, gender and level of play had no impact on ankle functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Tenodesis of the PL to the PB has been the standard norm in PL graft harvest for various ligament surgeries. The present high-powered prospective cohort study shows that tenodesis.does not improve ankle functional outcome scores compared to no tenodesis. Further work is needed to assess the impact of tenodesis or no tenodesis on ankle biomechanics (eversion, plantarflexion and gait). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1007/s43465-025-01361-1,
4,PM-4,Aryana et al. (2025),2025,No Difference in Ankle Morbidity Between the Leg with Peroneus Longus Used for ACL Reconstruction Autograft and the Contralateral Side 12 Months Postoperatively,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries often require surgical intervention. The use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction has been reported to offer significant potential benefits, such as preserving the hamstring tendons. However, its effects on the ankle must be considered prior to surgery. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study evaluating ankle morbidity using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, plantarflexion and eversion strength, and Clarke's angle on both extremities. Data were collected from patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test with SPSS v.26. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included, with the mean AOFAS scores of 58.88 (donor side) and 70.12 (contralateral side). Mann-Whitney test results showed no significant difference in AOFAS scores between the two sides (p=0.085). The mean plantarflexion strength values were 62.23 (donor) and 66.77 (contralateral), with no significant difference (p=0.489). Additionally, the mean Clarke's angle values were 59.10 (donor) and 69.90 (contralateral), with no significant difference (p=0.099). CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in ankle function in patients who used the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft in ACL reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.52965/001c.144731,
5,PM-5,Calvo et al. (2025),2025,Effect of diameter reduction by compression on peroneus longus allograft integrity: A biomechanical analysis,"BACKGROUND: There is broad consensus regarding the minimum required graft diameter in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery; a diameter of at least 8ÿmm is recommended when using hamstring tendon grafts. However, it remains unclear what happens when a larger-diameter graft is compressed to a smaller diameter, and how this alteration may affect the biomechanical properties of the graft. The objectives is determine whether the biomechanical strength of compressed allografts is preserved after reducing their diameter, and whether compression techniques could be considered a viable option for smaller patients such as women and children. Our hypothesis is that a compressed graft may retain similar strength to the original, despite having a reduced diameter. METHODS: This was a cadaveric biomechanical case-control study using 30 peroneus longus (PL) tendon allografts. The grafts were divided into three groups: Group 0 (8ÿmm uncompressed grafts), Group 1 (9ÿmm uncompressed grafts), and Group 2 (10ÿmm with a graft tube, compression to 9ÿmm). Each graft was tested using a Zwick/Roell Z005 tensile testing machine, undergoing cyclic loading between 50 and 250ÿN at 1ÿHz for 1000 cycles, followed by continuous tensile loading to failure. The maximum failure force (Fmax) was recorded for each graft. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.18.5. RESULTS: Group 1 (9ÿmm uncompressed grafts) showed a mean maximum failure force of 1902 N (SD: 432.12; 95ÿ% CI). Group 2 (compressed grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1608ÿN (SD: 233.12; 95ÿ% CI), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (pÿ=ÿ0.037). Group 0 (native 8ÿmm grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1341ÿN (SD: 936.67; 95ÿ% CI). No statistically significant difference was found between Group 0 and Group 2 (pÿ=ÿ0.196). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the compressed group had lower resistance compared to the original 9ÿmm grafts. However, when compared to the smaller-diameter grafts, no significant difference in strength was observed. Nonetheless, the compressed grafts showed a tendency to withstand higher loads than the native 8ÿmm grafts.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.jor.2025.06.036,
6,PM-6,Chen et al. (2025),2025,Comparative efficacy of different lengths of anterior cruciate ligament stump during reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury affects individuals, and successful ACL helps patients return to an active lifestyle. This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length?ò?1/2 and <?1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump?ò?1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump?<?1/2) groups (n?=?17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. RESULTS: In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p?<?0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p?<?0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p?>?0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p?>?0.05). CONCLUSION: During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length?ò?1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length?<?1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1186/s12893-025-02913-w,
7,PM-7,Corrˆa et al. (2025),2025,Combined Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Posterolateral Corner Reconstruction: Modified Technique Using a Single Femoral Tunnel Using Hamstrings and Peroneus Longus Tendon,"Posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries are uncommon injuries often associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesions. Several difficulties, including graft, femoral tunnel convergence, and the need for multiple fixation devices, complicate the combined ACL and PLC reconstruction. The purpose of this Technical Note is to describe a combined ACL and PLC reconstruction technique, using hamstrings and peroneus longus autologous grafts, in which the same femoral tunnel for the ACL and fibular collateral ligament reconstruction is used.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.eats.2025.103557,
8,PM-8,Silva et al. (2025),2025,Inframalleolar harvest of the peroneus longus tendon graft: Surgical technique,"Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft has recently gained visibility in the literature as a promising option for knee ligament reconstructions. The most used harvesting technique is performed with a single incision posterior to the lateral malleolus, with large series reporting tendon lengths enough to prepare a double or triple anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, resulting in mean diameters greater than 8.0 mm. However, as happens with the hamstrings, some patients may present PLT grafts with a 7-mm diameter, which is associated with higher failure rates and is the minimum acceptable diameter for ACL reconstructions. In turn, the 2-incision technique has longer graft lengths reported, enough to prepare 4-folded grafts, with mean diameters above 9.0 mm, ranging from 8.5 to 10 mm. Once the PLT graft diameter has a direct correlation with anthropometric measurements, as well as larger ACL graft diameters are associated with lower failure rates and revision surgeries, the inframalleolar harvesting seems to be a reasonable option, especially for short-stature patients with a greater risk of insufficient grafts. Additionally, patients who benefit from an extra-articular procedure can have a combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament using the PLT graft with the two-incision technique, with no need for another graft. Therefore, this article aims to describe the step-by-step technique for the inframalleolar PLT harvesting.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.jisako.2025.100384,
9,PM-9,Gupta et al. (2025),2025,Ipsilateral Autologous Peroneus Longus and Bone Patellar Tendon Graft for Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Leads to Similar Functional Outcome,"INTRODUCTION: Due to the yearly rise in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions, revision ACL reconstruction is becoming more and more common in knee surgery. Choosing the appropriate graft and determining the surgical treatment staging by assessing the likelihood of doing the most anatomical revision canals and placing them with the primary canals before surgery are crucial factors affecting treatment outcomes. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in the patient-reported functional outcomes in revision ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autografts in a single-stage revision ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients who were eligible for follow-up among 25 surgeries performed between 2015 and 2023 were included in this retrospective analysis and met the inclusion criteria. The patient reported functional outcome, Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity level, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain before the injury and during the most recent follow-up. The peroneus longus (PL) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) groups' patient-reported results were assessed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two revision groups with PL and BPTB autograft in terms of age, sex, duration between injury and surgery, concurrent injuries, and isolated or complex surgeries. There was not a significant difference between the groups' pre-injury patient-reported outcomes, including the Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity, and VAS for pain (n.s.). There was not a significant difference in the two groups' functional results at follow-up, although both groups' functional outcomes improved and all patients recovered to their pre-injury activity level. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings suggest that graft options (peroneus longus and BTB) and surgical complexities (isolated and complex revision) yield comparable functional outcomes for most measures. However, notable differences in post-operative pain levels warrant further exploration. These results underscore the effectiveness of both graft types and surgical techniques in achieving satisfactory recovery while acknowledging the necessity of customized approaches to pain management based on individual patient circumstances.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.13107/jocr.2025.v15.i04.5506,
10,PM-10,Hinz et al. (2025),2025,MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft satisfactorily restores knee stability with no impairment in foot function and with a low failure rate for concurrent ACL reconstruction,"PURPOSE: Addressing grade 2 and 3 medial-sided instabilities during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is crucial to reduce the risk of ACL graft failure. This study introduced a minimally invasive, medial collateral ligament (MCL) augmentation technique using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft, which was fixed to the femoral deep MCL insertion and tibial superficial MCL insertion. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal, single-centre case series included patients who underwent MCL augmentation concurrent with primary or revision ACL reconstruction due to anteromedial instability. Preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up, clinical examinations, such as rolimeter test of anterior tibial translation and medial instability, knee (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], Lsyholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and foot function scores (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score [AOFAS]) and complications, were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 13.5?ñ?2.6 months and a mean age of 27.8?ñ?9.6 years were included. The side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation significantly improved from preoperative to 1-year follow-up with an ACL reconstruction failure rate of 6.5%. No patient retained a grade 2 or 3 medial instability on valgus stress testing with 30ø flexion. Significant improvements from preoperative to 1-year postoperative follow-up were observed in knee function scores: IKDC (48.9?ñ?26.9- 71.3?ñ?11.5, p?<?0.001) and Lysholm (59.9?ñ?28.5-80.5?ñ?11.2, p?=?0.002) as well as KOOS pain, ADL, sport and QoL, each reaching the respective minimal clinically important difference values. The foot function score AOFAS showed no significant impairment (100?ñ?0-99.3?ñ?2.5, p?=?0.250). Complications included cyclops lesions of ACL reconstruction in three patients. CONCLUSION: At 1-year follow-up, MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft for patients simultaneously undergoing ACL reconstruction satisfactorily restores knee stability, has a low ACL reconstruction failure rate and does not significantly impair foot function.

11,PM-11,Jie et al. (2025),2025,Muscle mechanics and energetics in chronic ankle instability and copers during landing: Strategies for adaptive adjustments in locomotion pattern,"Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and copers typically exhibited aberrant landing kinematics. Altered kinematics might lead to changes in muscle loading, potentially affecting the energy demand of locomotion. Understanding alterations in muscle mechanics and energetics during landing could enhance the rehabilitation program design. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the muscle mechanics and energetics of individuals with CAI, copers, and healthy controls during single leg jump landing. Three groups, CAI, copers, and healthy individuals (total nÿ=ÿ66), performed the landing task, and data on 3D motion capture, ground reaction force (GRF), and muscle activation were simultaneously collected. A musculoskeletal model was applied to estimate muscle force and mechanical power. Compared to healthy groups, individuals with CAI showed increased peak muscle forces in the gluteus maximus (pÿ<ÿ0.001), gluteus medius (pÿ<ÿ0.001), vastus lateralis (pÿ<ÿ0.001), and peroneus longus (pÿ<ÿ0.001) during landing. Whereas copers exhibited higher peak muscle forces in the vastus lateralis (pÿ<ÿ0.05), medial gastrocnemius (pÿ<ÿ0.05), soleus (pÿ<ÿ0.05), and peroneus longus (pÿ<ÿ0.001). Additionally, negative mechanical power redistribution in CAI shifted from the ankle to the hip (pÿ<ÿ0.001), while copers exhibited a similar redistribution from the ankle to the knee (pÿ<ÿ0.05). This study suggested that both CAI and copers exhibit biomechanical modifications in proximal joints. Copers showed a novel landing strategy aimed for enhancing landing stability, but with the risk of ACL injury. The identified energy redistribution observed in both CAI and copers could potentially contribute to the recurrent ankle sprains. This research facilitates a better understanding of how muscle mechanics and energy demands influence the landing pattern in individuals with CAI and copers.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.heliyon.2025.e41901,

(2025),2025,Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and Double Extra-Articular Reinforcement,"This study describes a technique for double extra-articular reinforcement associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction for patients with both internal and external rotational instability, using reinforcements from the hamstrings and the anterior half of the peroneus longus muscle. The technique involves using 2 reinforcements: one for anterolateral stabilization and the other for anteromedial stabilization. The procedure follows a detailed algorithm for diagnosing rotational instability through physical examination under anesthesia. This approach offers a solution for complex ACL injuries involving bidirectional rotational instability, aiming to optimize knee stability and reduce failure rates in ACL reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.eats.2025.103456,
13,PM-13,Karapinar et al. (2025),2025,An Evaluation of the Effect on Ankle Stability of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft Used in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on the effect of the peroneus longus tendon graft on the knee; in this study, we focused on its impact on the ankle. Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are frequently observed in sports injuries. The peroneus longus tendon graft has rapidly gained a place in the literature; however, very few studies have been conducted on the foot-ankle region stability of this tendon. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect on this region of the peroneus longus tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). STUDY DESIGN: Case series, Level of evidence 4. METHODS: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023.The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded. RESULTS: The dynamometer measurements of the donor side and the contralateral side were compared. No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the ankle eversion and plantar flexion strength measurements (P = .096, P = .835, respectively). A significant result was obtained in the flamingo test (P = .049). No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the anterior, posterior, and lateral distances of the Y test (78.8 vs 78.6 cm, P = .973; 96.6 vs 80.4 cm, P = .053; 89.5 vs 95.0 cm, P = .357, respectively). In the examination of ankle functionality, no statistically significant difference was determined in the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score of the 2 sides (P = .798, P = .206, respectively). CONCLUSION: The peroneus longus tendon can be safely used as an alternative autograft in ACLR without causing donor site morbidity. There may be a deficit in balance test performance.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/23259671251371229,
14,PM-14,Khalil and Zawam (2025),2025,Comparative study of Peroneus longus tendon autograft versus Hamstring tendon autograft in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the functional outcomes and donor site morbidities after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using peroneus longus (PL) tendon versus hamstring (HST) tendon autografts. METHODS: The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18-20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P?<?0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group. CONCLUSIONS: PL tendon autograft can be used as a safe and effective autograft choice for ACLR with excellent functional outcomes comparable to HST tendon autograft and minimal donor site morbidity.

15,PM-15,Kumar et al. (2025),2025,Comparison of Surgical and Non-Surgical Treatment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Middle-Aged Population: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Background The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most commonly injured ligaments of the human body. The main mechanism of injury is usually when a pivoting injury occurs in which the tibia is translated anteriorly. At the same time, the knee is in a slight valgus and flexed attitude, and is predominantly found in contact sports like soccer. The variable symptoms that warrant medical attention usually include pain, swelling, knee giving way, difficulty ambulating, and reduced knee range of motion. The treatment usually depends on the patient's symptomatology, type of injury, the growth remaining in his or her growth plates, and activity goals. The purpose of the study is to determine the superior treatment modality for ACL injury in patients older than 40 years. Methodology The study was a prospective study conducted in the orthopedic outpatient department of a tertiary care center in northern India. A total of 60 patients were included in the study sample. Patients were divided into two treatment groups: Group A (n=30), consisting of conservatively managed patients, and Group B (n=30), consisting of surgically managed patients. Various symptoms during presentation were also noted in the study, which showed pain and instability as the predominant symptoms on presentation. Treatment modalities for ACL injury in our study include conservative management by physiotherapy and surgical management with ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus autograft. The physiotherapy protocol and post-surgery rehabilitation protocol were kept the same to compare the outcome in both groups. The Lysholm knee scoring scale was used to calculate the functional outcome of conservatively and surgically managed groups before intervention and post-intervention at the first, third, sixth, and twelfth months. The data was collected and summarized in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and analyzed with IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., using the ANOVA test, chi-square test, and paired t-test. A p-value of < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. Results The study was conducted with two groups (group A: conservative; group B: surgical group) with comparable demographic profiles and slight male predominance, comparing the functional outcome of surgically and conservatively managed middle-aged patients with ACL injuries. The Lysholm knee scoring scale showed a poor pre-intervention score in both groups. This subsequently improved over a period of one year of study for both groups. After 12 months, a Lysholm Knee Score of 75.80ñ5.95 (group A) and 96.13ñ2.65 (group B), with a p-value of < 0.001, was noted, which showed a significantly superior functional outcome of surgical intervention in ACL injury as compared to conservative treatment in the study population. Conclusions Sixty patients over 40 years of age were taken up for the study, with more than two-thirds of the study population being male. The study showed the pre-intervention Lysholm knee scoring scale for both groups to be ""poor."" The score remained ""poor"" even after the first month post-intervention. After 12 months, a Lysholm Knee Score with an ""excellent"" outcome was noted in the surgical group (group B), which depicted an overall superior functional outcome of surgical intervention in ACL injury as compared to conservative treatment in the study population.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7759/cureus.84489,
16,PM-16,Liang and He (2025),2025,Harvesting of Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"Autografts are always used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Traditional sources, such as hamstring tendons, bone-patellar tendon-bone, and quadriceps tendon, are popular choices but may result in muscle imbalances and dynamic differences in knee kinematics. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as an alternative autograft for ACL reconstruction, offering comparable functional outcomes and avoiding interference with the flexor-extensor complexes of the knee. However, concerns about donor site paresthesia and ankle dysfunction have been raised in PLT harvesting. This article presents a detailed protocol for safely and effectively obtaining this autograft. The protocol emphasizes critical steps, modifications, and potential troubleshooting methods. In this study, we assessed functional scores, donor paresthesia, and other complications in 20 patients six months after PLT harvesting. Our findings indicate that this protocol for PLT acquisition did not result in significant complications. Therefore, we confirm the effectiveness of this protocol and offer guidance on essential preoperative preparations and surgical techniques.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.3791/66390,
17,PM-17,Pontoh et al. (2025),2025,Anterior Knee Pain Evaluation Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Using Anterior Half of The Peroneus Longus (AHPL) Autograft,"INTRODUCTION: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is crucial for knee stability and joint movement coordination. ACL injuries are common, often leading to knee instability and subsequent complications. ACL reconstruction is a standard treatment option, with various autograft sources available. The anterior half of the peroneus longus (AHPL) tendon has emerged as a potential alternative autograft. This study aimes to examine the anterior knee pain in ACL reconstruction using AHPL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 51 patients with ACL injuries undergoing ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft. Patient demographics, surgical details, and Kujala scores were collected. RESULTS: The average age of our participants was 25.88 ñ 5.39 years, with mean BMI classified as obese. Significant improvements in Kujala and KOOS pain scores were observed between each data collection. There was a negative correlation between baseline and three and six months post-operatively Kujala and KOOS pain scores with BMI. DISCUSSION: The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft significantly reduced anterior knee pain, as indicated by a better Kujala and KOOS pain score. Previous studies have highlighted concerns regarding anterior knee pain with other autograft sources, such as the patellar and hamstring tendons.

18,PM-18,Pugazhendhi et al. (2025),2025,Comprehensive Arthroscopic Management of Multi-ligament Knee Injury: A Case Report,"INTRODUCTION: Multi-ligament knee injuries (MLKIs), involving damage to two or more major knee ligaments, present complex challenges in orthopedic surgery due to the intricacy of the injury and its significant impact on knee stability and function. These injuries often require specialized treatment strategies, with two-stage surgical reconstructions emerging as a viable option. This report examines a case of MLKI and the outcomes of a staged surgical approach to repair and reconstruct the affected knee ligaments. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old female sustained a multi-ligament injury to her right knee after a twisting event, resulting in pain, swelling, and instability. The patient underwent a two-stage arthroscopic reconstruction, beginning with repair of the posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner structures, followed by anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Autografts, including the bilateral peroneus longus and contralateral hamstrings, were used for the procedure. Her rehabilitation protocol emphasized early passive range of motion exercises, with delayed weight-bearing to promote effective healing. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the successful restoration of knee stability and function following a two-stage surgical approach to MLKI. The case underscores the need for individualized treatment plans and highlights the potential benefits of a phased procedure. While promising, further research is required to compare single-stage and two-stage approaches and to assess their long-term outcomes in managing complex MLKIs.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.13107/jocr.2025.v15.i05.5608,
19,PM-19,Singh et al. (2025),2025,Evaluation of Ankle Complications after Peroneus Longus Tendon Harvesting for ACL Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common and debilitating, often requiring surgical reconstruction. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is a promising autograft for ACL reconstruction, with less donor site morbidity than traditional grafts like bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring tendons. This study evaluates donor site ankle morbidity after PLT harvesting for ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study at an Indian Government Medical College and Hospital from February 2023 to October 2024 involved 56 patients with symptomatic ACL tears who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using PLT grafts. Donor site morbidity was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using the visual analog scale for foot and ankle (VAS-FA) and American orthopaedic Foot and Ankle society (AOFAS) scores at 14 days, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Data were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 36.8 years and an average injury duration of 13.3 months. Donor site morbidity occurred in 66.1% of patients, mainly as mild pain and swelling, which improved significantly over time. VAS-FA scores dropped from 7.52 preoperatively to 2.05 at 6 months, and AOFAS scores increased from 54.8 to 80.0. Chronic injury duration (over 16 months) was associated with poorer recovery, while preoperative pain, gender, graft size, and weight-bearing duration had no significant impact on recovery outcomes. CONCLUSION: PLT harvesting for ACL reconstruction leads to minimal donor site morbidity, with mild pain and swelling that improve over time. PLT grafts offer a promising alternative to traditional autografts, providing comparable outcomes and fewer complications. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.13107/jocr.2025.v15.i06.5718,
20,PM-20,Soleymanha et al. (2025),2025,Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields good functional outcome of the ankle: A systematic review and meta-Analysis,"PURPOSE: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as a promising autograft option for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, but concerns persist regarding donor-site morbidity and ankle functional outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate ankle performance following PLT harvest for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis performed by searching five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) up to March 2025. Inclusion criteria included: ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft, ò6-month follow-up, and validated ankle outcomes (American Orthopaedic Foot And Ankle Society [AOFAS]/Foot and Ankle Disability Index [FADI] scores). Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models using R software (version 4.4.3). Heterogeneity was assessed via Iý statistics, and risk of bias was evaluated using JBI checklists. RESULTS: Twenty articles (1024 patients) were identified, comprising eleven prospective cohort studies and nine randomised clinical trials (RCT), based on title, abstract, and quality assessments. Meta-analysis demonstrated excellent postoperative ankle function, with pooled AOFAS scores of 96.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.6-99.3) at 6 months, 96.1 (93.9-98.2) at 12 months, and 97.2 (93.9-100.6) at 24 months. FADI scores similarly improved to 97.4 (96.0-98.9) by 6 months and 99.4 (98.7-100.1) at 24 months. Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age and AOFAS outcomes (??=?-0.23, p?=?0.36). Minor complications (e.g., transient hypaesthesia) occurred in 13%-23% of patients but resolved within months. No studies reported major nerve injuries or ankle instability. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields minimal donor-site morbidity, with consistently high AOFAS/FADI scores across all age groups. These findings support the safety of PLT autografts, though heterogeneity is evident, and the predominance of male participants and the regional focus of studies, mainly Asian populations, may affect generalisability.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the 18 patients underwent arthroscopic single-stage revision ACLR using autologous PLT with an additional modified Limier LET procedure. Patients were thoroughly assessed pre- and post-operatively by the Lachman test, the pivot shift test, and the side-to-side difference by the Rolimeter. Functional evaluation was done with the help of the Lysholm score, the IKDC subjective score, Tegner score, VAS score, MARX activity rating scale and The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. Post-operatively, patient satisfaction, return to sport, and physical activity were also recorded. SPSS ver. 22.0 software was used. Wilcoxon test, paired and unpaired t-tests were used to compare variables. Statistical significance was determined by a two-sided p-value <0.05. RESULTS: Regarding subjective evaluations; post-operative residual laxity, and return to sport and physical activity, all of the patients demonstrated excellent results. Post-operatively, there was significant improvement in the anterior knee laxity. According to the Marx Activity Rating Scale, the extent of sports engagement was significantly increased at 18 months following surgery (p<0.001). According to the AOFAS score (p=0.38), there were no documented significant donor site morbidities. CONCLUSION: Single-stage revision ACLR using PLT with an additional modified Lemaire LET procedure results in a significant reduction in residual knee laxity with good clinical outcomes and a high return to play and physical activity.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.5704/MOJ.2503.004,

(2025),2025,Harvesting the Full Thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Is Not Associated With Structural Foot Impairments: A 12- to 23-Year Follow-up Study,"BACKGROUND: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft is suggested as a promising alternative graft option for reconstructive procedures supported by a growing body of evidence indicating favorable results. However, concerns remain regarding long-term functional impairments of the foot and ankle after harvesting a full-thickness PLT. PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term donor site morbidity in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a PLT autograft. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with harvested PLT autografts, and all eligible patients were invited to participate in a clinical examination at the hospital. To evaluate their range of motion, all included patients underwent a physical examination. Clinical outcomes were measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Activities of Daily Living and Sports subscales of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-ADL and FAAM-S). To evaluate foot and ankle structural changes, the intermetatarsal angle (IMA), hallux valgus angle (HVA), arc height index (AHI), lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (LTFMA), calcaneal pitch angle (CPA), and metatarsal angle (MA) were measured in the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients who were available for the final follow-up were included in this study. The mean age of the patients at the final follow-up was 45.7 ñ 9.5 years. The mean follow-up time was 19.5 ñ 3.4 years. AOFAS scores were excellent in 92.3% of patients (n = 24) and good in 7.7% (n = 2). The mean FAAM-ADL score was 99.6 ñ 1.86. The mean FAAM-S score was 98.1 ñ 5.94. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side for any of the measured parameters-including the IMA, HVA, AHI, LTFMA, CPA, and MA. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated good to excellent long-term patient-reported outcomes and negligible radiographic changes after harvesting the full thickness PLT compared with the contralateral side. These long-term data strongly support PLT harvesting as an alternative graft choice and suggest that this method does not alter the natural history of foot and ankle structures.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/23259671251320659,

25,PM-25,Acharya et al. (2024),2024,Functional Outcomes of Anatomic Single Bundle Primary ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon (Without a Peroneal Tenodesis) Versus Hamstring Autografts,"OBJECTIVES: There is a paucity of comparative studies on the Peroneus longus tendon versus conventional hamstring autograft use in primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction. To date, there are no studies that reported donor ankle functional outcomes when a peroneus longus graft is harvested without performing a tenodesis to peroneus brevis. METHODS: A single-center retrospective comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcomes (IKDC & Tegner-Lysholm scores) of primary isolated single bundle anatomic ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus tendon (PL group) versus Hamstring (HT group) autografts. Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. RESULTS: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/- 0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/- 0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre-op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre-op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre-op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre-op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/- 2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon appears to be a better autograft choice than hamstrings for primary ACL reconstruction.

(2024),2024,Outcome of percutaneous reconstruction of chronic lateral collateral ligament rupture,"PURPOSE: Many techniques have been described for the reconstruction of chronic lateral collateral ligament (LCL) rupture with different autograft options. The advantages of percutaneous LCL reconstruction include small incisions, minimal soft tissue disruption, less postoperative pain, and speedy rehabilitation and recovery. The aim of this study was to report the functional outcome of percutaneous LCL reconstruction and overall patient satisfaction in Africans. METHODS: This prospective and interventional study involving 51 patients with chronic LCL rupture who had percutaneous LCL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft was conducted between January 2021 and December 2022 in National Orthopaedic Hospital, Dala-Kano, Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were patients between the ages of 18 and 45 years with chronic isolated LCL and not more than 1 injury of knee ligament. Exclusion criteria were active infection, and multi-ligament knee injury requiring 2-staged surgery. The knee functions were assessed preoperatively, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively using the Lysholm scoring system. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of the treatment was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Relevant information was recorded into Microsoft Excel sheet and data was analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 for windows. The paired samples t-test was used to compare the clinical outcomes as continuous variables. Statistical significance was considered at pÿ<ÿ0.05.

28,PM-28,Arora et al. (2024),2024,Lower Limb Length and Body Weight are Surrogate Predictors of Peroneus Longus Autograft Diameter,"INTRODUCTION: Graft diameters are essential in any ACL surgery, with diameters less than 8mm associated with higher revision rates. Peroneus longus (PL) grafts have garnered much attention recently due to ease of harvest and more reliable graft diameters. The present study aimed to study various anthropometric parameters associated with PL-graft diameters. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 50 patients undergoing PL harvest for ACL surgery at a tertiary referral hospital. Age, gender, height, weight, length of the lower leg (lateral tibial plateau to the tip of the fibula), circumference at the head of the fibula and girth at the lateral malleolus were measured pre-operatively. The length of the graft doubled and tripled graft diameters were assessed intra-operatively. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the association between the pre-operative anthropometric variables and the intra-operative graft diameters and length of graft harvested. RESULTS: The mean doubled and tripled PL-graft diameter in our study population was 7.7?ñ?0.9 mm and 8.7?ñ?0.8 mm, respectively. The mean length of the graft was 25.9?ñ?3.5 cm. We found no significant correlation between graft diameters and age, gender or height of the patient. We found that the patient's weight significantly correlated (p?<?0.001) with graft diameter. We also found that the length of the lower leg (p?<?0.0001), circumference at the head of the fibula (p?=?0.001) and girth at the lateral malleolus (p?=?0.029) showed significant correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter. CONCLUSION: We found that weight, length of the lower leg and girth at the head of the fibula showed a strong correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1007/s43465-024-01266-5,
29,PM-29,Ashton et al. (2024),2024,"The Biomechanical, Biochemical, and Morphological Properties of 19 Human Cadaveric Lower Limb Tendons and Ligaments: An Open-Access Data Set","BACKGROUND: Methodological heterogeneity hinders data comparisons across isolated studies of tendon and ligament properties, limiting clinical understanding and affecting the development and evaluation of replacement materials. PURPOSE: To create an open-access data set on the morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical properties of clinically important tendons and ligaments of the lower limb, using consistent methodologies, to enable direct tendon/ligament comparisons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nineteen distinct lower limb tendons and ligaments were retrieved from 8 fresh-frozen human cadavers (5 male, 3 female; aged 49-65 years) including Achilles, tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, fibularis (peroneus) longus, fibularis (peroneus) brevis, flexor hallucis longus, extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, flexor digitorum longus, quadriceps, patellar, semitendinosus, and gracilis tendons; anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments; and 10 mm-wide grafts from the contralateral quadriceps and patellar tendons. Outcomes included morphology (tissue length, ultrasound-quantified cross-sectional area [CSAUS], and major and minor axes), biomechanics (failure load, ultimate tensile strength [UTS], failure strain, and elastic modulus), and biochemistry (sulfated glycosaminoglycan [sGAG] and hydroxyproline contents). Tissue differences were analyzed using mixed-model regression. RESULTS: There was a range of similarities and differences between tendons and ligaments across outcomes. A key finding relating to potential graft tissue suitability was the comparable failure loads, UTS, CSAUS, sGAG, and hydroxyproline present between hamstring tendons (a standard graft source) and 5 tendons not typically used for grafting: fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus tendons. CONCLUSION: This study of lower limb tendons and ligaments has enabled direct comparison of morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical human tissue properties-key factors in the selection of suitable graft tissues. This analysis has identified 6 potential new donor tissues with properties comparable to currently used grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This extensive data set reduces the need to utilize data from incompatible sources, which may aid surgical decisions (eg, evidence to expand the range of tendons considered suitable for use as grafts) and may provide congruent design inputs for new biomaterials and computational models. The complete data set has been provided to facilitate further investigations, with the capacity to expand the resource to include additional outcomes and tissues.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/03635465241260054,
30,PM-30,Asif et al. (2024),2024,Randomized Controlled Study Comparing Hamstring Graft and Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft in Arthroscopic ACL Reconstruction,"INTRODUCTION: Graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has been evolving. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using tripled or quadrupled PLT autograft (if graft thickness exceeded 10 mm then tripled) or quadrupled HT autograft. Patients were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, and 24-month post-operatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared. RESULTS: The mean diameter of the PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of the HT autograft, and the mean graft harvesting time was less (P < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 36 days earlier than those in the HT group (P < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity, and better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference between the groups in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Despite some donor site complications, such as numbness and infection, both PLT and HT grafts offer acceptable knee stability. However, PLT grafts seem to provide superior subjective functional outcomes based on patient-reported scores. More research is needed to further establish these findings and optimize graft choices for individual patients.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.13107/jocr.2024.v14.i11.4980,
31,PM-31,Blanke et al. (2024),2024,An anteromedial stabilization procedure has the most protective effect on the anterior cruciate ligament in tibial external rotation. A human knee model study,"INTRODUCTION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains associated with the risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces. METHODS: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. RESULTS: The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation. CONCLUSION: This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1007/s00402-024-05357-8,
32,PM-32,Butt et al. (2024),2024,5-years outcomes following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction comparing quadruple hamstring and peroneus longus tendon autografts: a randomized control trial,"AIMS: This study presents clinical outcomes, functional results, and return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using quadruple hamstring tendon autograft or peroneus longus tendon autograft in a randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6ÿmonths, 1, 2, and 5ÿyears after the surgery. At the 5ÿyear follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9?ñ?0.4ÿmm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9?ñ?0.2ÿmm in the PL group (P?<?0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6?ñ?3.9 (range?=?85-100). CONCLUSION: Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.

34,PM-34,Oliveira et al. (2024),2024,Evaluation of the peroneus longus tendon as an autologous graft in knee surgery,"Our hypothesis is that the peroneus longus (PL) is a great option for ligament reconstruction in the knee, and therefore the objective of the study is to determine if the use of this graft is safe and does not cause secondary damage to the harvested area. A prospective study was conducted between April 2019 and September 2022. Patients who underwent any type of knee ligament reconstruction using the PL or just the anterior half (AHPL) as grafts were followed up. These patients were evaluated according to the Tegner-Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) guidelines for functional evaluation of the knee and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) for the functional evaluation of the ankle. Most patients had an increase in the IKDC score, Tegner-Lysholm score, AOFAS and FADI regardless of the graft used in the surgical procedure, with mean values at the 24-month follow-up of, respectively, 99.02ñ 0.02, 98.69ñ 0.08, 99.92ñ 0.07, and 99.92ñ 0.07 for those with PL grafts and 99.31ñ 0.54, 98.88ñ 0.95, 100ñ 0.00, and 100ñ 0.00 for those with AHPL grafts. The differences in the scores between the two graft groups during each of the follow-up periods were significant (P?=?0.001).

(2024),2024,"Functional Outcome of Single-Bundle Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction using Peroneus Longus Graft and Hamstring Graft: An Open-Label, Randomized, Comparative Study","Background This study investigates the functional outcomes of single-bundle arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, comparing the use of two distinct graft sources: peroneus longus (PL) graft and hamstring graft. The choice of graft material in ACL reconstruction is crucial for optimal postoperative results, and this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the comparative efficacy of these two graft types. Method This open-label randomized comparative study involved a carefully selected cohort of patients undergoing single-bundle arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PLÿgraft group or the hamstring graft group. Surgical procedures were conducted using standardized techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols were closely monitored. Functional outcomes, including range of motion, stability, and patient-reported measures, were assessed at predefined intervals to ensure comprehensive data collection. Results The study underscores significant demographic and clinical factors in ACL reconstruction outcomes. Participants were predominantly aged 17-30 years (58.33%) with a mean age of 29.27 years and exhibited a male predominance (80.56%). Common complaints included knee pain and instability, primarily due to falls from bikes (55.56%) or sports-related trauma (44.44%). Notably, PL grafts demonstrated advantages over hamstring grafts, with longer mean length (10.11 mm vs. 8.77 mm, p=0.0001) and shorter operation times. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committeeÿ(IKDC), and Tegner Lysholm scores show no significant differences between grafts over the period of time. There is no notable foot eversion weakness or significant donor site morbidity after the PL graft harvest.ÿHamstring graft cases exhibit a higher incidence of altered sensation and muscle atrophy, suggesting the potential benefits of PL grafts for improved surgical outcomes. Conclusions Graft comparisonsÿfavored PL grafts due to longer length, and functional outcome assessments between the two graft types. However, foot and ankleÿstrength assessments revealed fluctuations in strength recovery with PL grafts, highlighting the need for tailored rehabilitation. Thigh circumference variations suggested potentialÿmuscle atrophy in the hamstring graft group, along with reported paresthesia in theÿipsilateral proximal leg. In conclusion, PL grafts offer potential advantages for ACL surgery, but ongoing monitoring and specialized rehabilitation are crucial.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7759/cureus.60239,

(2024),2024,Donor Site Morbidity after Removal of FullThickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction: 4-Year Follow-up,"PUSPOSE OF THE STUDY. Many studies have investigated the efficacy of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and donor site morbidity has not been adequately studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using PLT were included. Ankle strengths of the patients evaluated with an analog dynamometer. Ankle range of motion (ROM) was measured with a smart phone inclonometer application. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the postoperative ankle strength(eversion, plantar flexion) in the donor area and the preoperative period (p=0.6 and p=0.7, respectively) and contralateral healthy side (p=0.6, p=0.6, respectively). Ankle ROM angles (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, inversion) were significantly lower in the post-operative period compared to the preoperative period and contralateral healthy side (p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative AOFAS scores (p=0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Although PLT can affect ROM angles, it is a promising alternative for ACL reconstructions without causing functional morbidity.

37,PM-37,Farey et al. (2024),2024,Outcomes of ACL Reconstruction Utilizing Supercritical CO(2)-Sterilized Allografts,"BACKGROUND: Allograft tendons are perceived to have a high ACL graft failure rate in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO2-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. HYPOTHESIS: ACLR with SCCO2 allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO2-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL-Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 ñ 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged ó25 years (P = .007). Neither donor age (ó40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P > .05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. CONCLUSION: SCCO2 processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/23259671241254115,

39,PM-39,G”k et al. (2024),2024,Peroneus Longus vs Hamstring Tendon Autografts in ACL Reconstruction: A Comparative Study of 106 Patients' Outcomes,"BACKGROUND Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction commonly uses a hamstring tendon autograft, but the peroneus longus tendon can also be used. This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. MATERIAL AND METHODS ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot &amp; Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. RESULTS There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56ñ0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44ñ0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46ñ3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48ñ4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. CONCLUSIONS Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain. The peroneus longus tendon, with its larger diameter, fewer graft-related complications, and similar knee scores compared to the hamstring group, is considered a suitable alternative graft source.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.12659/MSM.945626,
40,PM-40,G”kler et al. (2024),2024,The effect of sterilization and storage on the viscoelastic properties of human tendon allografts - Continued: Storage for 0 to 4ÿmonths,"The role of donor-derived tendons, also known as allografts, in anterior cruciate ligament replacement surgeries is steadily increasing. Before surgery, temporary storage and, in most cases, sterilization are essential. It is, thus, crucial to determine how these procedures alter the grafts' biomechanical properties. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of different sterilization methods (native, frozen, frozenÿ+ÿ21ÿkGy gamma irradiation, frozenÿ+ÿ21ÿkGy electron beam irradiation) and storage durations (0 to 4ÿmonths) on the deformation and creep of two tendon types (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus). 80 tibialis anterior and 83 peroneus longus tendons from 51 human cadavers were included. The samples were removed, placed in a radio-cryoprotectant solution, then slowly cooled, sterilized and stored at -80ÿøC. All groups were subject to 60ÿs static creep test with 250ÿN load. Deformation during the loading phase, creep during static loading, and the ratio of these two were evaluated. Deformation at the end of the loading phase and creep consistently exhibited significantly smaller values in the tibialis anterior compared to the peroneus longus type, as well as in electron beam-sterilized grafts as opposed to gamma beam-sterilized ones. Prolonged storage periods (within 0 to 4ÿmonths) resulted in a notable increase in these values, particularly in deformation. Based on the experimental data, the tibialis anterior tendon type and sterilization by gamma beam irradiation are better choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than the peroneus longus and sterilization by electron beam. Increased storage time affects negatively the evaluated mechanical properties.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2023.111904,
41,PM-41,Held et al. (2024),2024,Surgical Technique of Single-Graft Double-Bundle Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Peroneus Longus Tendon,"The posterior cruciate ligament is the primary posterior stabilizer of the knee. Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) has been demonstrated to improve outcomes and stability of the knee compared with conservative management. Numerous techniques are available to the treating surgeon, such as the double-bundle PCLR technique, which has biomechanical superiority over single-bundle PCLR. Residual knee laxity is decreased, native knee kinematics are better replicated, and improved subjective and objective outcomes have been reported with anatomic double-bundle PCLR. The potential disadvantages of allografts and the use of multiple grafts have created the need for the use of a double-bundle PCLR with a single autograft. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) grafts are frequently used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and good results have been reported with their use in single-bundle PCLR. The advantages of the PLT graft include a long length, large cross-sectional area, and a simple harvesting technique.

42,PM-42,Kilic et al. (2024),2024,Relationship between peroneus longus tendon graft thickness and anthropometric variables: a radiographic study using ultrasonography,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of anthropometric measurements for two-stranded peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft thickness using ultrasonography MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 204 healthy volunteers (102 males and 102 females) aged 18-40ÿyears. Anthropometric measurements were recorded, including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), fibular length, calf circumference, and ankle circumference. The Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) was used to assess activity levels. PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured using ultrasonography. Two-stranded PLT graft thickness was calculated using the previously reported formula by Luo etÿal. A thickness of less than 8ÿmm of PLT graft was accepted as an insufficient autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of two-stranded PLT graft thickness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to establish the best threshold values. RESULTS: Males had a significantly greater PLT CSA (0.17?ñ?0.03 cm2) and predicted two-stranded PLT graft thickness (8.1?ñ?0.6ÿmm) compared with females (0.15?ñ?0.03 cm2 and 7.5?ñ?0.6ÿmm, respectively; p?<?0.001 for both). Correlation analysis revealed that two-stranded PLT graft thickness positively correlated with height, weight, BMI, fibular length, calf circumference, ankle circumference, and Tegner Activity Scale in both genders, with stronger correlations observed in females. The logistic regression model identified height and calf circumference as significant predictors of sufficient two-stranded PLT graft thickness (ò?8ÿmm) in males, while calf circumference and the TAS were significant predictors in females. ROC analysis demonstrated that calf circumference and the TAS had acceptable discriminatory abilities in females, with 36.25ÿcm and?ò?4 cutoff points, respectively. However, no anthropometric variables in males exhibited strong discriminatory abilities for predicting two-stranded PLT graft thickness CONCLUSIONS: Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females. However, no anthropometric variables in males could be used strongly for prediction. These anthropometric measurements can assist in preoperative planning and decision-making, potentially improving ACLR outcomes by ensuring adequate graft thickness in females.

43,PM-43,Lara et al. (2024),2024,New Graft Choices for ACL Reconstruction: Update Article,"Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common procedure for injuries to this ligament, especially in athletes. There are different types of grafts used, and the choice depends on several factors. Autologous grafts, from the patients themselves, are the most common option, with rapid incorporation and a lower failure rate. Allografts from donors have their role in specific cases. Synthetic grafts, used in the 1980s, have advantages such as the absence of morbidity at the donor site, but studies have shown long-term complications. Hybrid grafts, combining autologous grafts and allografts, have gained interest, allowing a larger diameter and reducing morbidity. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has received attention, with positive results, good knee function and less hypotrophy of the thigh at the donor site. Autologous quadriceps tendon graft has gained popularity, with results comparable to patellar and flexor tendon grafts, lower morbidity at the donor site and a lower rate of re-rupture. The choice of graft has evolved, with autologous flexor grafts being preferred for less active patients and patellar grafts with bone fragments for high-performance athletes. Allografts, synthetic and hybrid grafts have their role in specific circumstances. The choice must be based on scientific evidence, considering advantages and disadvantages. ACL reconstruction is a complex procedure that requires individual considerations to select the most appropriate graft.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1055/s-0044-1779335,
44,PM-44,Mirza et al. (2024),2024,Donor-site morbidity following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft,"INTRODUCTION: Peroneus longus has proved to be a promising graft for ACL reconstruction due to its high tensile strength, and ease of harvesting. While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population. MATREIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients. RESULTS: 20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 ñ 1.34 and 98.5 ñ 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 ñ 9.43 and 88.75 ñ 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886ñ22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 ñ 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio. CONCLUSION: While the use of peroneus longus tendon autografts in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction does not seem problematic on short-term subjective assessment, there is objective evidence in keeping with evertor weakness, weakness of first ray plantar flexion and possible ankle instability.

The study evaluates functional outcomes using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm-Tegner, and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, as well as knee stability through clinical tests, over a one-year postoperative period. Results The study demonstrates significant improvements in knee function, with substantial increases in IKDC and Lysholm-Tegner scores from preoperative levels (p-value < 0.01), and effective restoration of knee stability, as shown by improved Lachman, Anterior Drawer, and Pivot Shift test results. Moreover, the peroneus longus graft had minimal impact on ankle morbidity, as indicated by consistent AOFAS scores before and after surgery.

47,PM-47,Punnoose et al. (2024),2024,"Peroneus Longus Tendon Autografts have Better Graft Diameter, Less Morbidity, and Enhanced Muscle Recuperation than Hamstring Tendon in ACL Reconstruction","BACKGROUND: Recently the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) gained popularity in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and has been utilized with satisfactory outcomes. However, there are concerns regarding donor site morbidity. This study aims to compare the functional outcome of ACL reconstruction using hamstring (HT) and PLT autografts and evaluate the donor site morbidity. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (HT and PLT). Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Knee functional outcome was evaluated with IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores preoperatively, and postoperatively after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements, subjective evaluation of sensory disturbances, and ankle scoring with AOFAS and FADI scores. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, the PLT group showed comparable IKDC (p?=?0.925) and Tegner-Lysholm (p?=?0.600) scores with those of the HT group. The mean graft diameter in the PLT group (7.93?ñ?0.52ÿmm) was larger compared with the HT group (7.43?ñ?0.50ÿmm) (p?<?0.001). The incidence of thigh atrophy (HT-16.7%, PLT-10%) and sensory disturbances (HT-73.3%, PLT-10%) was greater in the HT group. There was no significant ankle donor site morbidity in the PLT group (AOFAS-98.67?ñ?3.45, FADI-99.23?ñ?1.69). CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction with PLT had comparable functional outcome with that of HT at 1 year. However, PLT demonstrated larger graft diameter, less donor site morbidity, and enhanced muscle recovery without significantly affecting the ankle function. PLT can be safely used as an acceptable alternative graft choice harvested from outside the knee for ACL reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1007/s43465-024-01185-5,

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and complications between revision ACLR using allografts and PLT autografts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who underwent arthroscopic revision of ACLR with complete clinical follow-ups between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Allograft was used in 44 of these patients, and PLT autograft was used in 15 of them. Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, Lachman, and anterior drawer tests were performed after a mean follow-up of 60months (range: 19-116). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to evaluate the donor ankle functions. Clinical outcomes and complications were compared between groups. RESULTS: Both groups showed significantly improved functional outcomes compared to their preoperative assessments. However, both groups had similar clinical results at the final follow-up, including Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity scale, knee range of motion, return to sports, time to return to daily activities, and rate of re-rupture. No major complications were seen in any of the patients. The AOFAS score was 99.13ñ2.64 in the PLT autograft group without loss of ankle muscle strength, deformity, instability, and permanent iatrogenic neurovascular injuries. The cumulative cost of the allograft group was significantly higher than the PLT autograft group. CONCLUSIONS: The PLT autograft might be an alternative autograft option to allografts due to similar clinical outcomes, low donor site morbidity, and reduced cost in ACLR revisions, especially if the primary ACLR was performed using grafts harvested around the knee.

50,PM-50,Soni et al. (2024),2024,Functional Outcomes in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction: A Nine-Month Follow-up Study Using Lysholm Score in a Rural Tertiary Care Center in India,"Introduction The knee joint, an extraordinary feat of biomechanics, is prone to injuries, with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) often being a common victim. The intricate coordination of joint movements relies heavily on the ACL's screw-home mechanism, a crucial element for synchronizing knee movement with neighboring joints. Despite its indispensable role, the ACL is susceptible to injury, necessitating surgical intervention. While many patients experience positive outcomes following ACL reconstruction surgeries, a significant proportion face the challenge of procedure failure. The key to success lies in the healing process within the tibial and femoral bone tunnels. The post-ACL reconstruction phase introduces its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of returning to sports (RTS), underscoring the importance of reinstating neuromuscular and motor function. The trajectory of rehabilitation is influenced by factors such as graft healing, patient age, gender, pain levels, and concurrent injuries. Materials and methods This prospective observational study spanned 2.5 years, enrolling 71 patients with diagnosed ACL injuries. Arthroscopic reconstruction utilized hamstring autografts and peroneus longus autografts. A nine-month post-surgery follow-up employed the Lysholm scoring system for comprehensive evaluations. Results Over 2.5 years, 87.3% of male and 12.6% of female participants underwent arthroscopic reconstruction. Lysholm scores revealed 28.1% excellent, 45.0% good, and 26.7% fair outcomes, with no participants in the unsatisfactory range. Lysholm scores demonstrated positive outcomes, indicating the efficacy of arthroscopic reconstruction in enhancing knee function. Findings align with existing literature, emphasizing positive results from ACL reconstruction techniques and specific implants. Comparisons with related studies highlight challenges in standardized return-to-sport guidelines and underscore the need for outcome measure standardization. Conclusion The study contributes nuanced insights into ACL reconstruction outcomes, emphasizing positive functional recovery trends at the nine-month follow-up. Lysholm scores indicate favorable outcomes, supporting the procedure's effectiveness. Consideration of specific implants adds practical value. Despite limitations, this study enriches ACL reconstruction research, promoting advancements in patient care and outcomes. Ongoing research with extended follow-ups and larger cohorts will enhance understanding and refine ACL reconstruction strategies.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7759/cureus.53480,

Several growth factors, cytokine, chemokine, and protease inhibitors functions in stimulation of paracrine reactions in fibroblast, endothelial, and stem cells thereby promoting the tissue restorative processes. Augmented with dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft reinforces the reconstructed ligament and aids in effective restoration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case control study 15 patients undertaking ACL reconstruction with tripled peroneus augmented dHACM (G1) were prospectively monitored up for a period of 8 months along with 15 control patients (G2) without dHACM augmentation. Clinical and radiological outcomes were analysed and assessed about effect of augmenting the peroneus longus graft using dHACM. Clinical analysis included pre-operative two, four, six, and eight months post-operative Tegnor-Lysholm score, and radiological analysis included the 6th month postoperative MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements by mean signal-value at femoral insertion, midsubstance and tibial insertion of ACL graft. RESULTS: Clinically, as a mean Lysholm score of all patients, they were revealed to be consecutively high in G1 than in Group 2 at four, six, and eight months. The signal-to-noise ratio from the MRI results showed majority having good healing in G1 group. CONCLUSIONS: Based on 6-month MRI, an effective ligamentization (SNR<75) was noticed in 53.33% of patients in the dHACM allograft enhanced group on comparison with 33% in the controls. The overall results show that the augmentation of dHACM allograft to ACL reconstruction yields in good patient outcomes at post-operative follow-up.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.5704/MOJ.2403.005,
52,PM-52,Ya?ar et al. (2024),2024,Examination of the Tensile Strength of the Peroneus Longus Muscle,"INTRODUCTION: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT)ÿis increasingly used as a tendon autograft in ligament and tendon reconstructions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the biomechanical properties of the PLT to assess its usability in frequently performed reconstructions. METHODS: Six fresh-frozen, below-knee cadavers with a mean age of 65 years, no previous surgical operation, and no history of chronic disease were used. PLTs were harvested, freed from muscle tissue, and prepared for tensile strength testing at a tensile force rate of 2 mm/min using a Shimadzu Autograph AG-IS 100 kN instrument (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). RESULTS: The maximum tensile force varied between 600.7 N and 1131.313 N, with a median of 758.185 N. All tendons had diameters of 8 mm or more. The elongation at maximum force ranged from 9.0 mm to 16.0 mm, with a median of 14.0 mm. CONCLUSION: According to this study, PLT is a viable choice for surgeries involving autograft reconstruction. However, further clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in reconstructive surgeries.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7759/cureus.66683,
53,PM-53,Zhang et al. (2024),2024,The Efficacy of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon and its Impact on Ankle Joint Function,"OBJECTIVE: Peroneus Longus Tendon (PLT), a viable anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, shares similar biomechanics, making it suitable for reconstruction. Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system-Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. RESULTS: One year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p?<?0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p?>?0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p?>?0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p?<?0.05). CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1111/os.14060,
54,PM-54,Zhao et al. (2024),2024,The effect of harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon on foot morphology and gait,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the strength of the graft was found to be unsatisfactory usually the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was taken for supplementation, but the effect on foot and ankle function and gait in the donor area is unclear. This study aims to explore the changes in the ankle and gait after using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a reconstruction graft for the anterior cruciate ligament. METHODS: A total of 20 patients, 6 males and 14 females, aged 18 to 44ÿyears, with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries, underwent reconstruction using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft between June 2021 and December 2021. The part on which the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was harvested was considered the experimental group, while the contralateral foot was the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups. RESULTS: All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P?>?0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the gait cycle parameters, including the percentage of time in the stance, mid-stance, and push-off phases, as well as foot strike angle and push-off angle (P?<?0.05). CONCLUSION: Through our study of the surgical experimental group we have shown that harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon does not affect foot morphology and gait parameters; however, it does impact the gait cycle.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1186/s13018-023-04429-6,
55,PM-55,Agarwal et al. (2023),2023,Comparison of Functional Outcomes of an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Using a Peroneus Longus Graft as an Alternative to the Hamstring Tendon Graft,"Background Ever since the arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has begun, the use of the peroneus longus (PL) graft for primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has never been thought of. There is very little literature on it. Hence, our study aims to compare the functional outcomes, knee stability, donor site morbidity, and assessment of thigh muscle wasting in patients with ACL injury managed by arthroscopic single bundle reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendons (HT), respectively. Methods All adults aged 16-50 years of either gender presenting with symptoms of symptomatic ACL deficiency were admitted for arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR and allocated into two groups (peroneus longus and hamstring tendon). Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm score), clinical knee evaluation (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift test), donor site morbidity (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score (AOFAS)), and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively and at six months and one year postoperatively. The same post-op rehabilitation protocol was followed in both groups. Results One hundred and ninety-four patients (hamstring n = 96, peroneus n = 98) met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences between the preoperative, six-month postoperative, and one-year postoperative scores between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (p=0.356) and Lysholm knee score (p=0.289). The mean for the AOFAS was 99.05 ñ 3.56 and 99.80 ñ 0.70 in the PLT and HT groups, respectively, showing no statistical difference, with a significant improvement in thigh muscle wasting among the PLT group at final follow-up (p < 0.001). Conclusion We observed similar knee stability and functional outcomes and no obvious donor site morbidity among both groups. These patients also had better responses to physiotherapy in recovering from their thigh muscle wasting. So, we can recommend that a PL graft can be a safe, viable, and effective option for usual arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7759/cureus.37273,
56,PM-56,Alardi (2023),2023,Hamstring graft size for anterior cruciate ligament repair in a sample of Iraqi men,"The goal of the current investigation was to measure the size of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft following hamstring (gracilis and semitendinosus) tendon autograft procedures in a relatively large sample size of Iraqi men. In this study, the quadruple hamstring tendon (semitendinosus and gracilis) was measured in a sample of Iraqi adult males. The study enrolled 300 Iraqi men who underwent anterior cruciate ligament repair at Diwaniyah Teaching Hospital and Alforat Alawast Private Hospital between January 2020 and December 2021. The repair procedure was based on the utilization of the quadruple (gracilis and semitendinosus) hamstring tendon. The primary outcome measure was the size of the tendon, determined using a sizing tube calibrated to 0.5 mm. Out of the sample, 80% of patients had a graft diameter of 7.5 mm, while 15% had a graft diameter of 8 mm, and 5% had a diameter of 7 mm. Body mass index was a poor predictor of graft size, whereas patient height was an excellent predictor of graft diameter. The graft diameter in most Iraqi subjects with anterior cruciate ligament injuries needs to be five bands or even six bands; otherwise, other graft sources like bone-patellar-bone or peroneus longus tendon grafts should be considered. The graft diameter may be reliably anticipated based on the patient's height.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.25122/jml-2023-0071,

58,PM-58,Ashton et al. (2023),2023,"Challenging the Perceptions of Human Tendon Allografts: Influence of Donor Age, Sex, Height, and Tendon on Biomechanical Properties","BACKGROUND: The use of allograft tendons has increased for primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but allograft supply is currently limited to a narrow range of tendons and donors up to the age of 65 years. Expanding the range of donors and tendons could help offset an increasing clinical demand. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of donor age, sex, height, and specific tendon on the mechanical properties of a range of human lower leg tendons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nine tendons were retrieved from 39 fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs (35 donors [13 female, 22 male]; age, 49-99 years; height, 57-85 inches [145-216 cm]) including: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior and anterior, fibularis longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, and flexor digitorum longus. Tendons underwent tensile loading to failure measuring cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum load, strain at failure, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus. Results from 332 tendons were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for donor age, sex, height, and weight. RESULTS: Mechanical properties were significantly different among tendons and were substantially greater than the effects of donor characteristics. Significant effects of donor sex, age, and height were limited to specific tendons: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior, and tibialis anterior. All other tendons were unaffected. The Achilles tendon was most influenced by donor variables: greater CSA in men (? = 15.45 mm2; ?id k adjusted P < .0001), decreased maximum load with each year of increased age (? = -17.20 N per year; adjusted P = .0253), and increased CSA (? = 1.92 mm2 per inch; adjusted P < .0001) and maximum load (? = 86.40 N per inch; adjusted P < .0001) with each inch of increased height. CONCLUSION: Mechanical properties vary significantly across different human tendons. The effects of donor age, sex, and height are relatively small, are limited to specific tendons, and affect different tendons uniquely. The findings indicate that age negatively affected only the Achilles tendon (maximum load) and challenge the exclusion of donors aged >65 years across all tendon grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings support including a broader range of tendons for use as allografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and reviewing the current exclusion criterion of donors aged >65 years.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/03635465221143385,
59,PM-59,Cakar et al. (2023),2023,Complications of peroneus longus tendon harvesting: a retrospective review of 82 cases,"OBJECTIVE: Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has become a reliable autologous graft option for various ligament reconstructions. But there are potential risks and complications associated with its use as a graft. This retrospective study aimed to examine the complications and donor site morbidity following PLT harvesting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on an institutional digital patient database, and all patients who underwent ligament reconstruction using PLT autograft were identified. Intraoperative, early, and late complications were reviewed using digital patient notes and patients underwent a complete physical examination during their final follow-up. Ankle function was assessed using the AOFAS score, and manual ankle muscle testing was performed on both sides. Sural nerve iatrogenic injury was evaluated with a dermatomal light touch examination. Cosmetic satisfaction due to incision scar and footwear complaints were also assessed. RESULTS: 82 patients (74 male, eight female) with a mean age of 31.9?ñ?10.4ÿyears (range, 16-66) were included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up time was 46.6?ñ?30.3ÿmonths (range, 6-109). The mean AOFAS score for the donor side was 98.7?ñ?3.3 (range, 87-100), and the contralateral side score was 100, with manual muscle testing graded as 5 in all movements and similar to the contralateral side. Fifteen patients (18.3%) had hypoesthesia over the dorsolateral aspect of the foot distal to the incision scar, two patients (2.4%) had hyperalgesia over the distal incision scar, and one patient (1.2%) had mild ankle instability. There were two cases (2.4%) of compartment syndrome, both of which were treated with fasciotomy and had complete regression of symptoms after 5 days. One patient (1.2%) had a transient peroneal nerve injury and foot drop that resolved in the sixth month. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study suggest that harvesting the PLT is associated with a high rate of complications and donor site morbidity. The most common complication was hypoesthesia around the lateral side of the foot, although the ankle functions were not affected significantly. Two cases of compartment syndrome and one transient peroneal nerve injury were observed. Care should be taken while harvesting PLT autograft, and it should be kept in mind that peroneal nerve injury might occur.

61,PM-61,Escudeiro et al. (2023),2023,Augmentation of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Using the Peroneus Longus: Description of the Surgical Technique,"BACKGROUND: The quadruple graft from the hamstring tendons has become a widely used option in the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), however, this graft may not have the desirable diameter for the reconstruction, increasing the risk of re-rupture. In this context, the peroneus longus tendon graft appears as an option to complement other grafts, transforming a thin quadruple graft into a sextuple graft. INDICATIONS: The sextuple graft technique for ACL reconstruction is used in patients who have a quadruple graft with a diameter of less than 8 mm, and due to its length, it is not possible to make a quintuple graft, for example. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION: Initially, the hamstring tendons are removed with the aid of a tenotome. After that, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon is identified and removed. On the back table, the definitive graft is prepared so that we have a sextuple graft with a diameter greater than 8 mm. Finally, the ACL reconstruction is performed anatomically using an adjustable loop device in the femur and an interference screw in the tibia. RESULTS: In our experience with patients who have a hamstring graft diameter of less than 8 mm, we obtained an average increase of 1.8 mm in graft diameter when augmentation was performed with the anterior half of the peroneus longus. DISCUSSION: Grafts less than 8 mm in diameter are at increased risk of rupturing and failure of surgical treatment of the ACL injury. The surgeon must be prepared to make a quintuple or sextuple graft, but in some patients, the tendons are short or there is no availability of a tissue bank, making this practice impossible. The use of the anterior half of the peroneus longus to perform graft augmentation is safe, causing almost no morbidity to the donor area and is easily accessible during the procedure, making it an excellent option for increasing the diameter of thin grafts.

(2023),2023,Full-Thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft Harvest,"BACKGROUND: Despite extensive evidence of excellent biomechanical and clinical outcomes of ligament reconstructions with bone-patellar tendon-bone, hamstring tendon, and quadriceps tendon autografts, these are not without limitations, including knee-related donor site morbidity, decreased range of motion, and potential for anterior knee pain. Therefore, researchers have explored other options, including the peroneus longus (PL) autograft. INDICATION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (both primary and revision), as well as multiligament reconstruction, particularly in areas where access to allografts is limited. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: A 3-cm longitudinal skin incision is placed 2 fingerbreadths (or 3 cm) proximal to the tip of the lateral malleolus, and 3 mm posterior to the fibula. The PL and peroneus brevis tendons are identified and isolated, followed by a tenodesis at the distal limit of the incision. The PL is whipstitched proximal to the tenodesis site, and then incised between the tenodesis and whipstitched portion. A closed tendon stripper is inserted and advanced proximally until the PL graft is released. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: PL autograft harvest has been shown to generate thicker and longer grafts relative to the semitendinosus, with demonstrated efficacy in terms of both biomechanical and clinical outcomes. Current literature points largely to a good safety profile, although there is still conflicting evidence in terms of foot and ankle morbidity and no mid- to long-term follow-up data available.

63,PM-63,Goyal et al. (2023),2023,Full-thickness peroneus longus tendon autograft for anterior cruciate reconstruction in multi-ligament injury and revision cases: outcomes and donor site morbidity,"PURPOSE: Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft has been successfully used for isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction cases. Being a powerful evertor and flexor of great toe, there might be associated ankle morbidity with this autograft option. However, there are only a few studies exploring whether the ankle morbidity is significant or not. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes, donor site morbidity, and ankle strength after harvesting ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction in revision ACL and multi-ligament injury cases. METHODS: This was a prospective case series. All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS)ÿscore, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. RESULTS: Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22-31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5-8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p?=??<?0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p?=?0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p?=?0.19), eversion strength(p?=?0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p?=?0.52), and AOFAS score(p?=?0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Peroneus longus autograft can be considered as a potential autograft option for ACL reconstruction in multi-ligament knee injuries and revision ACL reconstruction. No significant donor site morbidity was noted at follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1007/s00590-021-03145-3,
64,PM-64,Hossain et al. (2023),2023,A prospective study of arthroscopic primary ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft: Experience of 439 cases,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are frequent ligamentous injuries that necessitate reconstruction in many cases. The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P < .001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. The peroneus longus tendon can be considered a safe, effective, and promising graft of choice for arthroscopic primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction because it has a good functional outcome and impressive donor ankle function after surgery.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1097/MD.0000000000032943,

Recently, the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concurrent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstructed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19ñ8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values. QT and PLT grafts are valuable alternatives for currently used grafts in combined ACL and ALL reconstructive procedures. This new technique is a reasonable option in ACL revision surgery and a good alternative in primary ACL and ALL reconstruction, especially when hamstring grafts are not advised or they are missing.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.20471/acc.2023.62.s3.6,
67,PM-67,Luo et al. (2023),2023,Preoperative ultrasound can accurately predict the diameter of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon autografts,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the correlation between the intraoperative diameter of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon (2PLT) and length of the PLT autograft and preoperative ultrasound (US) measurements, as well as radiographic and anthropometric measurements. The hypothesis was that US can accurately predict the diameter of 2PLT autografts during operation. METHODS: Twenty-six patients underwent ligament reconstruction with 2PLT autografts were included. Preoperative US was used to calculate the in situ PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) at seven levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10ÿcm proximal to the harvest start point). Femoral width, notch width, notch height, maximum patellar length, and patellar tendon length were determined on preoperative radiographs. Intraoperative measurements of PLT were made, including all fiber lengths of PLT and diameters of 2PLT using sizing tubes calibrated to 0.5ÿmm. RESULTS: CSA at 1ÿcm proximal to the harvest site had the highest correlation with the diameter of 2PLT (r?=?0.84, P?<?0.001). Calf length had the highest correlation with PLT length (r?=?0.65, P?<?0.001). The diameter of the 2PLT autografts could be predicted by the following formula: 4.6?+?0.2???[sonographic CSA of PLT at 1ÿcm level]; the length of PLT could be predicted by the following formula: 5.6?+?0.5???Calf length. CONCLUSION: The diameter of 2PLT and length of PLT autografts can be accurately predicted by preoperative US and calf length measurements, respectively. Accurate preoperative prediction of the diameter and length of autologous grafts can provide the most suitable and individualized graft for patients.

68,PM-68,Pham et al. (2023),2023,Reference intervals of complete blood count and coagulation tests in Vietnamese pregnant women,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy has major effects that make hematology parameters outside ofÿnormal reference ranges. Therefore, we conducted this study to establish reference intervals for Vietnamese pregnant women. METHODS: From June 2023 to Augst 2023, blood samples from 879 eligible pregnant women were run on DxH 900 hematology analyzer and ACL TOP 550 coagulation analyzer. The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference intervals. RESULTS: PT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count. The reference intervals for PT (seconds), APTT (seconds), fibrinogen (mg/dL), in the first trimester were 10.30-12.88, 25.40-35.46, 280.28-559.00, in the second trimester were 9.80-11.66, 24.05-33.23, 347.75-593.35, in the third trimester were 9.60-11.40, 23.40-31.80, 330.28-628.56, respectively. The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (??109/L), RBC (??1012/L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (??109/L) in the first trimester were 6.33-15.24, 3.73-5.32, 10.33-13.95, 32.22-42.29, 169.66-413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99-15.55, 3.33-4.98, 9.71-13.17, 30.26-40.07, 172.34-372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22-14.14, 3.54-4.98, 9.80-13.97, 31.11-42.70, 151.30-417.14, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.

69,PM-69,Saeed et al. (2023),2023,"Earlier Return to Sports, Reduced Donor-Site Morbidity with Doubled Peroneus Longus Versus Quadrupled Hamstring Tendon Autograft in ACL Reconstruction","BACKGROUND: Graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has been evolving. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared. RESULTS: The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.

70,PM-70,Sahoo and Sahu (2023),2023,Analysis of Postural Control following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Ipsilateral Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"INTRODUCTION: Harvesting peroneus longus for ACL reconstruction is thought to create ankle instability which could add to postural instability from an ACL injury. This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three- and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. RESULTS: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals. CONCLUSION: The static and dynamic balance, which is impaired after ACL injury, improves with ACL reconstruction with PLT autologous graft. Hence PLTG can be safely used as a graft for ACL reconstruction without affecting postural control and body balance.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.5704/MOJ.2303.016,

(2023),2023,ACL Reconstruction in a Poliotic Limb with Peroneus Longus Graft,"INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of polio was very high in India before its eradication, with a number of people living with its residual effects. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is the most common knee injury. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in literature presenting ACL injury in a poliotic limb and its management. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old male with poliotic limb and equinovarus deformity presented with ACL injury to the same limb. ACL reconstruction was done using Peroneus longus graft. Postoperatively patient was gradually returned to preinjury activity levels. CONCLUSION: ACL tears in a poliotic limb can be a challenging case. Proper preoperative planning and anticipation of problems can help in managing the case with a good outcome.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.13107/jocr.2023.v13.i06.3724,
72,PM-72,Wierer et al. (2023),2023,Peroneus Longus Split Versus Semitendinosus Tendon Autograft Size: A Cross-sectional Study,"BACKGROUND: The anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) has been reported to be a suitable autograft for ligament reconstruction with low donor-site morbidity. However, clinical data on graft size are limited. PURPOSE: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 ñ 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 ñ 0.7 cm for the ST (P < .05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 ñ 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 ñ 0.7 mm for the ST (P < .05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P < .01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P < .01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P > .05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P < .05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P > .05). CONCLUSION: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length. However, predicting graft diameter based on thigh or shank circumference was more challenging, with higher BMIs affecting the ability to predict ST more than AHPLT.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/03635465231165297,
73,PM-73,Xu et al. (2023),2023,Platelet-Derived Exosomes Alleviate Knee Osteoarthritis by Attenuating Cartilage Degeneration and Subchondral Bone Loss,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic degenerative joint disease among the aged population. However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1? stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. RESULTS: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study illustrated that the administered Plt-exos could alleviate knee OA by attenuating cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss, possibly serving as a novel promising treatment for OA in the future.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/03635465231188122,

75,PM-75,Butt et al. (2022),2022,Peroneus Longus Tendon Harvesting for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"There remains controversy regarding the ideal graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction1. Bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring autografts have been considered the gold standard for decades. Despite the good clinical outcomes, donor-site morbidity is a concern for both of these grafts2. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has also been considered as a potential graft for many orthopaedic reconstructive procedures3. The biomechanical properties and thickness of such a graft permit its use for ACL reconstruction3,4. The tensile strength of a peroneus longus tendon autograft is the same as that of a hamstring autograft and greater than that of a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and a quadriceps tendon graft3,5. We aimed to describe the steps to harvest the peroneus longus tendon autograft during single-bundle ACL reconstruction. DESCRIPTION: Identification of anatomical landmarks is performed, including the distal aspect of the fibula and the posterior border of the fibula, 2 cm above the tip of the bone. A longitudinal incision is made along the posterior border of the fibular bone, from 2cm above the tip of the fibula. Care is taken to identify the tendon sheath that covers the longus and brevis approximately 2 cm above the superior extensor retinaculum, and the peroneus longus is stitched to the peroneus brevis. The proximal aspect of the peroneus longus tendon is whipstitched, after which the peroneus longus tendon and surrounding soft tissues are incised. The peroneus longus tendon is then released with use of a closed stripper, and the graft is prepared. ALTERNATIVES: Alternative nonoperative treatment options include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, rest, and limitation of sporting activities. Alternative surgical treatment options include arthroscopic debridement, ACL repair or reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring-tendon autograft, and ACL reconstruction with allograft. RATIONALE: Recent studies have shown that ACL reconstruction with use of a peroneus longus tendon autograft is safe and effective, with less donor-site morbidity compared with other tendon autografts4,6,7. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: The peroneus longus graft has been accepted for ligament reconstruction because of its strength, safety, and less donor-site morbidity7. The peroneus longus graft allows surgeons to harvest the autograft via a relatively small incision, resulting in fewer donor-site complications4. According to Rhatomy et al., the use of a peroneus longus graft provides good functional outcomes that are comparable with those of a hamstring autograft, but it has a larger graft diameter and its harvest results in less thigh hypotrophy8. Additionally, a case series of 10 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with use of a peroneus longus autograft showed satisfactory Lysholm scores and low disability according to the Foot and Ankle Disability Index9. IMPORTANT TIPS: Examination under anesthesia and arthroscopic confirmation of the ACL tear are recommended prior to harvesting the peroneus longus tendon.Take care to identify the anatomical landmarks of the peroneus longus and brevis.Tenodesis of the peroneus longus to the brevis is performed first, followed by whipstitching of the peroneus longus proximal to the site of the tenodesis.Once the peroneus longus tendon is passed through the closed stripper, gently maintain traction on the sutures while pushing the stripper proximally until the tendon is freed.Care should be taken not to damage the superior peroneal retinaculum, which provides the primary restraint to tendon subluxation.Identification of the peroneus longus and brevis is important. The peroneus longus tendon is free of muscle attachment and more rounded in shape, while the peroneus brevis contains muscle fibers.

76,PM-76,Gursoy et al. (2022),2022,Effect of Sectioning of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Posterolateral Structures on Lateral Compartment Gapping: A Randomized Biomechanical Study,"BACKGROUND: The contribution of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to lateral instability under varus stress, particularly compared with posterolateral structures, is not well known. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of sectioning the ACL and posterolateral knee structures on lateral compartment gapping under varus stress. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Fourteen nonpaired cadaveric knees were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: sequential sectioning of the ACL, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) (ACL-first group) or sequential sectioning of the FCL, PLT, PFL, and ACL (FCL-first group). Knees were loaded onto a custom jig at a 20ø flexion angle. A standardized 12-Núm varus moment was applied to each specimen in the intact state and after each randomized sequential-sectioning state. Lateral compartment opening was measured on radiographs to assess the contribution to the increase in the lateral gap caused by resecting the respective structure. The distance was measured by 3 observers on 15 images (5 testing states each imaged 3 times) per specimen, for a total of 210 radiographs. The articular cartilage surfaces were not included in the measurements. RESULTS: The mean increase in lateral opening after sectioning all structures (ACL and posterolateral corner) was 4.6 ñ 1.8 mm (range, 1.9-7.7 mm). The ACL and FCL sectioning contributed the most to lateral knee opening (1.3 ñ 0.6 and 2.2 ñ 1.3 mm, respectively). In both groups, lateral gapping >3 mm was achieved only after both the ACL and FCL were sectioned. All comparisons of increased mean gapping distances demonstrated a significant difference with subsequent sequential sectioning of structures, except comparisons between the FCL and PLT and the PLT and PFL. When considering the effect of the ACL on lateral opening, no significant difference was found between sectioning the ACL first or FCL first (P = .387). CONCLUSION: ACL deficiency significantly increased lateral opening under varus stress, regardless of the sequence of injury. The effect of injury to the ACL in addition to the lateral structures should be considered when using varus stress radiographs to evaluate knee injuries. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With the current findings, understanding the effect of ACL and posterolateral corner injuries on lateral gapping under varus stress can aid in correctly diagnosing knee injuries and determining appropriate treatment plans.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/23259671221100216,

(2022),2022,Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft versus Hamstring Tendon Autograft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Comparative Study with a Mean Follow-up of Two Years,"BACKGROUND: Peroneus longus tendon can be a suitable alternative autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. METHODS: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24-31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P<0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. CONCLUSION: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be an appropriate autograft for ACLR due to its strength, larger graft diameter, and avoiding potential complications of hamstring autograft obtained from the knee region.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.22038/ABJS.2022.59568.2938,
78,PM-78,Lu et al. (2022),2022,The promotive effect of grafts with the double-stranded peroneus longus tendon and with the four-stranded hamstring tendon on reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament injury,"INTRODUCTION: Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury hampers the rotational stability and stability front to back of the knee joint, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients. Some studies have reported that the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has sufficient length and strength. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that the PLT can be used as a novel appropriate material for PCL reconstruction therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we systematically analysed the clinical effect of the double-stranded PLT and the four-stranded hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the PCL and compared the effectiveness and safety of these two surgical approaches in the reconstruction of PCL injury. A total of 48 patients with complete rupture of the PCL were divided into Group A (reconstructed with the double-stranded PLT, 25 cases) and Group B (reconstructed with the four-stranded hamstring tendon, 23 cases). RESULTS: The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The intraoperative time for tendon extraction was significantly shorter in Group A than Group B. Twenty-four months after operation, patients in the two groups showed the alleviated tibial posterior displacement and the increased IKDC score, Lysholm score and Tegner score. Nevertheless, these scores showed no significant differences between the two groups. Additionally, compared with the therapy using the four-stranded hamstring tendon, therapy using the double-stranded PLT is simpler and safer. DISCUSSION: Both surgical methods are effective in the treatment of PCL injury. The PLT could be a good choice for PCL injury reconstruction material, especially when the four-stranded hamstring tendon is accidentally damaged or ineffective. Our study may provide guidance for the clinical treatment of PCL injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective study.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.otsr.2022.103336,
79,PM-79,Perry et al. (2022),2022,"Determining the Roles of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Posterolateral Corner, and Medial Collateral Ligament in Knee Hyperextension Using the Heel-Height Test","BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are often associated with other ligamentous injuries. The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. PURPOSE: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-Núm force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P = .863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 ñ 0.83-cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL-posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 ñ 1.02-cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 ñ 1.35-cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P = .154). CONCLUSION: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The side-to-side difference in heel height may be a clinically relevant examination tool for diagnosing multiligament knee injuries.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/23259671221086669,

(2022),2022,Proprioceptive postural control strategies differ among non-injured athletes,"Postural control during complex tasks requires adequate sensory integration and somaesthetic reweighting: suboptimal postural strategies can lead to injury. We assessed the ability of healthy athletes to reweight somaesthetic signals during postural perturbations on different surfaces. Thirty-five young (16ÿñÿ1ÿyears), healthy, elite handball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Proprioceptive reweighting was evaluated via vibration of the triceps surae and lumbar muscles on firm and foam surfaces. Postural variables and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius (GM), semitendinosus (ST) and fibularis longus (FL) were recorded during the PRE (10ÿs), VIBRATION (20ÿs) and POST (20ÿs) periods. Ankle proprioception was predominantly used on the firm compared to foam support. However, two opposing behaviours were observed: a ""rigid"" strategy in which reliance on ankle proprioception increased on the foam, and a ""plastic"" strategy that involved a proximal shift of proprioceptive reliance (pÿ<ÿ0.001). The plastic strategy was associated with a more effective recovery of balance after vibration cessation (pÿ<ÿ0.05). ST activation was higher during POST in the rigid strategy and did not return to the PRE level (pÿ<ÿ0.05) whereas it did in the plastic strategy. Proprioceptive strategies for postural control are highly variable and future studies should evaluate their contribution to injury.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.neulet.2021.136366,

Considering the drawbacks of other autografts, we analyse peroneus longus autograft holistically as a viable alternative. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 113 patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft between January 2017 and November 2018 for isolated, full-thickness ACL tears. Functional analysis was done using the Tegner-Lysholm score pre-operatively, at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postoperatively. At terminal follow-up, stability was checked clinically by Lachman test, residual morbidity of donor site was assessed using foot and ankle disability index, and radiographic correlation was done with magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The mean diameter of the graft after tripling was 9ÿñÿ0.71ÿmm and the average length before tripling was found to be 27.07ÿñÿ2.76ÿcms.

82,PM-82,Saki et al. (2022),2022,Female athletes with ligament dominance exhibiting altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns compared to healthy individuals during single-leg landing,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most serious knee injuries and occurs frequently during exercise. Altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns may contribute to dynamic knee valgus and ACL injury mechanisms. Lack of dynamic control of ground reaction force (GRF) is known to be contributing factor for ACL injury by placing excessive force on passive structures. Muscle co-contraction is a dynamic mechanism for GRF absorption. Therefore, any alterations in co-contraction might be a risk factor for ACL injury. Ligament dominance is a term to define individuals who rely more on ACL ligament for GRF control. RESEARCH QUESTION: This study aimed to compare the muscle co-contraction patterns of distal and proximal knee muscles during single leg landing in female athletes with and without ligament dominance. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 54 female athletes were assigned to the healthy (nÿ=ÿ27) and ligament dominance (nÿ=ÿ27) group based on their Tuck Jump test scores. The electromyography activity of the gluteus medius, adductor longus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured by an electromyography in drop down a 30-cm-high stair. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis (pÿóÿ0.05). RESULTS: The two groups demonstrated an overall significantly different muscle co-contraction patterns (Pÿ<ÿ0.05). There was a decreased in co-contraction of proximal group and an increased co-contraction in the distal muscles in ligament dominant group. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings have provided evidence to support the notion of neuromuscular imbalances in ligament dominance deficit. These findings can be useful for the coaches and experts to design preventive exercises and modify the current programs for the people affected by ligament dominance.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2022.02.011,
83,PM-83,Singh et al. (2022),2022,A Study of the Functional Outcome of Supplementation of Hamstring Graft With Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon in Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"INTRODUCTION: The present study was done to analyze the functional outcome, donor site morbidities, and associated parameters when using the anterior half of the peroneus longus for augmentation of an inadequate hamstring graft when performing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS: Thirty patients with complete ACL tears were operated on. In all these patients, the thickness or length of the hamstring graft takenÿwas found to be inadequate (less than 8 mm and 7.5 cm, respectively). So, additionally, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) graft was harvested to reach an optimum size of the final graft. Functional outcome was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at six weeks, three months, and six months. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score at six months was used to assess ankle stability. RESULTS: The mean age in our study was 28.8 years with male predominance (73.33%). The mean operative time was 86.4 minutes. The mean hamstring graft thickness in our study was 6.5 mm, which improved to 9.12 mm after augmentation. The mean graft length after AHPLT augmentation was 9.38 cm. The mean IKDC score at six months was 87.35. At the end of six months, FADI scores were found within normal limitsÿ(range: 135-136) in all the patients. No complications were noted in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: The AHPLT graft was always found to be sufficient enough for augmenting the hamstring graft to reach an acceptable thickness and length. There was no graft site morbidity and the ankle functional levels remained the same as preoperative levels, making it an excellent choice for augmentation of inadequate hamstring grafts.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7759/cureus.30138,

(2022),2022,Iatrogenic Foot Drop After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft: Report of a Rare Case,"Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using autografts is a common procedure performed in the modern era. The peroneus longus tendon is an upcoming graft with several advantages over traditional autografts. It has minimal donor site morbidity in relation to biomechanical properties of the ankle. Common peroneal nerve injury during harvest is a theoretical concern while harvesting the peroneus longus tendon. The following case highlights the importance of careful surgical technique and timely intervention while dealing with suchÿcomplications. A 25-year-old male suffered an anterior cruciate ligament rupture while wrestling. He had an unstable knee and difficulty performing daily activities. He underwent an arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft.ÿFollowing surgery, the patient reported a foot drop and decreased sensations over the dorsum of the foot.ÿThe patient was advised of a foot drop splint and neuroprotective medications. Neurophysiological studies were not performed since they cannot differentiate betweenÿpartial and complete nerve injury in the first week after injury. A surgical exploration of the nerve was done.ÿAn intraneural hematoma was found with contusions over the peroneus longus tendon. Neurolysis was performed to decompress the nerve. The functioning of the anterior cruciate ligament was satisfactory during follow-up. An advancing Tinel's sign was noted on follow-up. The patient finally recovered after a 3-month follow-up.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7759/cureus.26476,

(2021),2021,All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using an Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"BACKGROUND: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been used as a graft in many orthopaedic surgical procedures because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. PURPOSE: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30ø of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. RESULTS: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 ñ 0.62 vs 7.0 ñ 2.18 mm, respectively; P < .001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 ñ 8.27, 50.9 ñ 8.50, and 1.8 ñ 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 ñ 2.61, 95.2 ñ 2.64, and 6.8 ñ 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P < .001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively. No complications or reoperations occurred. CONCLUSION: All-inside ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft produced good functional scores and stability without obvious ankle-site morbidity.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/2325967121991226,
86,PM-86,Blanke et al. (2021),2021,Does the anterolateral ligament protect the anterior cruciate ligament in the most common injury mechanisms? A human knee model study,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction still has a risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Thus, extra-articular structures such as the anterolateral ligament (ALL) are increasingly treated. The ALL however prevents the internal rotation of the tibia and it must be doubted that the ALL protects the ACL in other common injury mechanisms which primarily include tibial external rotation. In this study we aimed to evaluate which extra-articular structures support the ACL in excessive tibial internal and external rotation using a knee finite element (FE) model. METHODS: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to an FE model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Three additional anatomic structures (anterolateral ligament, popliteal tendon and posterior oblique ligament) were added to the FE model separately and then all together. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. RESULTS: The ACL was the most loaded ligament both in tibial internal and external rotation. The ALL was the main stabilizer of the tibial internal rotation (46%) and prevented the tibial external rotation by only 3%. High forces were only observed in the LCL with tibial external rotation. The ALL reduced the load on the ACL in tibial internal rotation by 21%, in tibial external rotation only by 2%. The POL reduced the load on the ACL by 8%, the PLT by 6% in tibial internal rotation. In tibial external rotation the POL and PLT did not reduce the load on the ACL by more than 1%. CONCLUSION: The ALL protects the ACL in injury mechanisms with tibial internal rotation but not in mechanisms with tibial external rotation. In injury mechanisms with tibial external rotation other structures that support the ACL need to be considered.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.knee.2021.02.026,
87,PM-87,Budhiparama et al. (2021),2021,Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft: A Promising Graft for ACL Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing use of hamstring tendon as an autograft in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, some shortcomings have been found on the donor site. Therefore, an alternative autograft option with adequate strength and less donor site morbidity will be very valuable. Peroneus longus tendon has been found to be a promising option. INDICATION: Primary ACL reconstruction. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION: Peroneus longus tendon graft is harvested with a longitudinal skin incision at 2 to 3 cm (2 finger-breadths) above and 1 cm (1 finger-breadth) behind the lateral malleolus, followed by superficial fascia incision in line with skin incision. The peroneus longus and peroneus brevis tendons were then identified. The tendon division location was marked at 2 to 3 cm above the level of the lateral malleolus. After that, an end-to-side suture was performed between the distal part of the peroneus longus tendon and peroneus brevis tendon. The peroneus longus tendon was stripped proximally with a tendon stripper to at least 5 cm from the fibular head to prevent peroneal nerve injury. Graft preparation was performed with a standard procedure to obtain the suitable graft size. In routine arthroscopic ACL reconstruction, peroneus longus tendon graft fixation can be performed with a cortical suspension device, bioabsorbable screws, or a combined technique. RESULTS: Recent studies showed that peroneus longus autograft had a comparable outcome with hamstring tendon autograft in primary ACL reconstruction at a 1-year follow-up. The use of peroneus longus tendon autograft resulted in larger graft diameter and less thigh hypotrophy. The mean (ñSD) for the AOFAS-Hindfoot Score in the peroneus longus group was 97.3 ñ 4.2, while the mean FADI score was 98 ñ 3.4, both of which were considered excellent results. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The use of peroneus longus autograft in primary ACL reconstruction is a safe procedure with an excellent outcome. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be recommended as an alternative graft in single-bundle ACL reconstruction. Further study of the functional outcome and knee stability evaluation is recommended.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/26350254211009888,

Therefore, it becomes necessary to search for other graft alternatives. In this context, the peroneus longus tendon arises as an option to replace or complement other grafts. The surgeon can opt to use the tendon in its totality or only its anterior half, presenting adequate length, diameter, and biomechanics, without major repercussions for the donor site. In this study, we report a case of an athlete in which the autologous hamstring tendon graft did not present the adequate diameter for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 52 patients (38 males, 14 females; mean age: 29.2ñ7.7 years; range, 17 to 51 years) who received PLT autograft for ACL reconstruction in our center between July 2018 and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics of the patients and leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters were recorded before the operation. The PLT autograft diameter and length were measured during surgery. RESULTS: A statistically significant correlation was found between the graft diameter and length and weight, height, body mass index (BMI), leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters (p<0.01). There was no statistically significant correlation between the graft diameter and length and age (p>0.05). Distal leg diameter had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft diameter (r=0.956), while the height had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft length (r=0.982). CONCLUSION: Anthropometric parameters of height, weight, BMI, leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters may be helpful for surgeons to predict the diameter and length of the PLT autograft before surgery. Distal leg diameter is a particularly important parameter in predicting PLT autograft diameter.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.5606/ehc.2021.79580,

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 ñ 6.73, and 29.6 ñ 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision. Allograft ACL reconstruction is a good alternative to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon graft.

92,PM-92,G”kler et al. (2021),2021,The effect of sterilization and storage on the viscoelastic properties of human tendon allografts,"Allografts have become increasingly preferred for anterior cruciate ligament replacement purposes. The risk of infections necessitates thorough sterilization procedures, and the allografts usually need to be stored prior to surgery. Classical mechanical tests have been performed with various types of tendons, however, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus tend to suffer the least biomechanical changes after irradiation. Only few results are available of the strain and creep behaviour of tendons, even though this information is necessary to provide suitable allografts. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of different tendon types (T-tibialis anterior, P-peroneus longus), sterilization methods (G-gamma irradiation of 21ÿkGy, E-electron beam irradiation of 21ÿkGy) and storage times (5 and 6ÿmonths) on the creep behavior, which is characterized by the strain at the end of the loading phase and creep deformation after static loading. Static creep tests were performed with 250ÿN load during 60ÿs. Deformation at the end of the loading phase of both tendons was significantly smaller after 5ÿmonths long storage than that after 6ÿmonths long storage. TE5 showed significantly less creep than group TE6, and TE6 significantly greater than PE6. The creep of TE5 was significantly lower than that of TG5. Based on the data, the peroneus longus sterilized by electron beam and stored deep frozen for 5ÿmonths is a better choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than tibialis anterior sterilized by gamma irradiation stored for 6ÿmonths.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110697,
93,PM-93,Goyal et al. (2021),2021,Outcomes of one-stage reconstruction for chronic multiligament injuries of knee,"PURPOSE: This article aims to evaluate patterns of chronic multiligament injuries and outcomes of treatment with single-stage reconstruction using autografts. METHODS: All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6?weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years' follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48?ñ?9.9?years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2%) or chondral (40.7%) injuries. At the 2?years' follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p?=?0.0001) IKDC score (p?=?0.0001), Lysholm score (p?=?0.0001), and range of motion (p?=?0.001). None of the patients had residual laxity on clinical examination of the knee joint at the 2 years' follow-up. All but two of the patients went back to their previous activity level. These two patients had progressive knee arthritis and needed knee arthroplasty. CONCLUSION: Single-stage surgical reconstruction for chronic MKI has favourable functional outcomes.

This study also investigated whether the occurrence of patellar ligament thickening (PLT), which is commonly observed 2 months postoperatively after TPLO, is associated with misplacement of the osteotomy. A total of 120 dogs weighing more than 20?kg, 40 of which were control animals, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Stifles were radiographically evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively on the side with CCLR and on the healthy contralateral side and compared with clinically normal stifles. PLT was reassessed after 2 months. RESULTS: Significant decreases in median patellar height ratio were found after both procedures (TPLO 0.24 (0.05-0.8); CCWO 0.22 (0.05-0.4)). The postoperative craniocaudal patellar position and the median AMA angle differed significantly among the groups (P?=ÿ0.000) (TPLO 87.5% caudal to the AA and 3.12ø (0.76-6.98ø); CCWO 100% cranial to the AA and 0ø (-?1.34-0.65ø); control group 5% caudal to the AA and 0.99ø (0-3.39ø)). At 8?weeks, PLT grade differed significantly in the two operated groups (P?=ÿ0.000) (TPLO 40% 0-2, 20% 2-4, 40% >?4; CCWO 98.8% 0). CONCLUSIONS: TPLO and AMA-based CCWO are associated with significant decreases in patellar height; however, the PLT results 2 months postoperatively differed between the two groups; the decrease in patellar height and PLT were independent of osteotomy position in the TPLO group. Compared to TPLO, CCWO results in reduced postoperative AMA angles and craniocaudal patellar positions that more closely resemble those of unaffected dogs, suggesting that the CCWO procedure allows us to better correct the caudal bowing of the proximal tibia that is often associated with deficient stifles in large dogs with TPA >?30ø.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1186/s12917-021-03094-3,
95,PM-95,Joshi et al. (2021),2021,Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Safe and Effective Alternative in Nonathletic Patients,"INTRODUCTION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common injury which has been conventionally managed by various graft reconstruction using bone patellar tendon bone, or quadruple hamstring autograft, to name a few. However, all these grafts are associated with many complications. Lately, peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft has shown promising results in this field, although there is still a dearth of data on its use. We, therefore, aimed at carrying out a study to evaluate the functional outcome and knee stability results of ACL reconstruction using PLT graft. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a completely torn ACL were included in the study. The PLT was harvested, and graft length, thickness, and harvesting time were noted intraoperatively. Knee stability and functional scores were evaluated clinically and using Lachman test (primarily) and KT-2000 arthrometer and subjectively with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 6, 12, and 24 months (secondary outcome) postoperatively. Ankle scores were also recorded by making use of American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS)-Hindfoot Scale. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. The graft harvest time was 7.4 min (5-9 min). The mean thickness of the graft on doubling was 7.9 mm (7-9 mm). Ninety-six percent of the patients were satisfied with their results of the knee surgery, and 95% of the patients had no complaints of ankle joint. The mean IKDC score postoperatively was 78.16 ñ 6.23, and the mean AOFAS score was 98.4 ñ 4.1. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction using PLT graft yields a good functional score (IKDC, KT-2000 arthrometer) even at 2-year follow-up. It is a safe and effective autograft option for ACL reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.4103/njs.NJS_22_20,
96,PM-96,Khan et al. (2021),2021,Prediction of peroneus longus graft diameter for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by inframalleolar harvest and from anthropometric data,"BACKGROUND: The literature is gradually drifting towards a graft of larger diameter for successful ACL reconstruction. There is no published literature regarding the anthropometric predictors for the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft obtained in ACL reconstruction through the inframalleolar approach. METHODS: Fifty-two patients were finally evaluated for anthropometric parameters to predict quadrupled PLT graft diameter in ACL reconstruction using the inframalleolar technique. Intraoperative quadrupled PLT graft diameter was correlated to the patient's anthropometric data such as age, height, weight, duration of injury, and BMI. We used regression analysis in a stepwise manner to ascertain anthropometric indices associated with the graft diameter. RESULTS: This study included 46 males and six females. Mean age was 28.2 ñ 7.4 years, mean height was 172.7 ñ 2.8 cm, mean weight was 75.6 ñ 3.4 kg, mean BMI was 25.3 ñ 0.9 kg/m2, mean duration of injury was 9.2 ñ 3.9 months, and mean graft diameter was 9.3 ñ 0.4 mm. Positive correlation with graft diameter was found only with height (r = 0.6, P < 0.01) and weight (r = 0.4, P < 0.01). On analysing through linear regression, height and weight had significant association with graft diameter, and we formulated the following prediction equation: PLT graft diameter (mm) = 0.083 ? height (cm) + 0.011 ? weight (kg) -5.854. CONCLUSION: Patients' characteristics, including height and weight, have a significant correlation with quadrupled PLT graft diameter and the average diameter of graft is > 9 mm through this approach.",PubMed/MEDLINE,,
97,PM-97,Oliveira et al. (2021),2021,Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft to Reconstruct the Posterolateral Corner of the Knee,"The posterolateral corner is critical to knee stability. Neglected injuries have a direct impact on the prognosis due to residual instability, chronic pain, deformities, and failure to repair other structures. Several techniques are used to reconstruct the posterolateral corner, often with autologous ischiotibial grafts or homologous grafts. An option little used for knee ligament reconstructions is the peroneus longus tendon graft. Although reported as a good alternative for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, we found no case using a peroneus longus tendon graft for posterolateral corner reconstruction. Here, we describe the case of a patient who underwent a non-anatomical reconstruction of the posterolateral corner using a peroneus longus tendon graft. The patient underwent surgical procedures for ligament reconstruction and correction of the deformity caused by a failed graft, but his knee remained unstable. During the preoperative planning, it was decided to reconstruct the posterolateral corner with an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft. Studies have shown that the peroneus longus tendon graft does not increase ankle morbidity, and that its length and diameter favor ligament reconstruction. Thus, the present article highlights the importance of the proper diagnosis of ligament injuries in the acute phase, and describes a new technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction that must be included in the surgeon's body of knowledge, increasing the amount of technical options.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1055/s-0041-1724085,

(2021),2021,Tibial Avulsion with Intra-Articular Entrapment of Medial Collateral Ligament with Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tear with Posterior Root Medial Meniscus Tear: A Case Report of an Unusual Injury Triad,"INTRODUCTION: The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee joint; however, its displacement into the medial knee compartment is rare. Traumatic posterior root of medial meniscus (PRMM) tears are commonly found in high-grade injuries involving anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears along with MCL tears. Diagnosis of these injuries can be made by a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but they can be missed at times due to severe soft-tissue swelling in the acute phase. CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old gentleman presented with injury to the front of his left knee 5 days back. On examination, he had a Grade 3 effusion with valgus stress test and posterior drawer test being positive and medial joint line tenderness was present. A firm localized swelling was palpable on the medial joint line. MRI scan revealed a mid-substance PCL tear, ACL sprain, PRMM tear, and tibial side rupture of superficial MCL with proximally migrated wavy MCL fibers lying below the medial meniscus confirmed on arthroscopy. Medial meniscus root repair by pull through technique and PCL reconstruction with a 3-strand peroneus longus graft followed by open MCL repair with augmentation using a semitendinosus graft was performed. Postoperatively, the knee was kept in a straight knee brace for 4 weeks, followed by a hinged knee brace and appropriate physiotherapy were started. At 2 years follow-up, the patient had attained full range of knee motion with good quadriceps strength, tibial step off maintained, and negative posterior drawer test and valgus stress test. Displacement of torn MCL into the medial knee compartment is an extremely rare injury. Proximal or distal avulsion of MCL with intra-articular incarceration has been reported in isolation or associated with ACL tear. Such an injury triad as reported here has not been reported in the literature to the best of our review. CONCLUSION: In our case, we report a very unusual injury triad of PCL tear, PRMM tear, and distal MCL tear with intra-articular entrapment below the medial meniscus operated by a single-stage surgery with excellent outcomes.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.13107/jocr.2021.v11.i08.2352,

(2021),2021,[Short-term effectiveness of arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon for posterior cruciate ligament injuries],"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the short-term effectiveness of arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon for posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. METHODS: A clinical data of 30 patients with PCL injury, who were admitted between December 2015 and September 2018 and met the selection criteria, was retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon and TightRope technique. Among them, 19 were male and 11 were female, aged 17-48 years (mean, 28.2 years). The PCL injury was caused by traffic accident in 8 cases, sport in 14 cases, falling and bruising by a heavy objective in 5 cases, and other injuries in 3 cases. The interval between injury and operation was 10-90 days (mean, 39.3 days). The PCL injury was rated as grade ? in 6 cases and grade ? in 24 cases. The posterior drawer test was positive in 26 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 24 cases. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 61.37ñ8.49, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was near normal in 2 cases, abnormal in 8 cases, and significantly abnormal in 20 cases. The modified Lysholm knee score was 62.20ñ5.67. The knee range of motion (ROM) was (101.83ñ8.15) ø. RESULTS: The operative time ranged from 70 to 110 minutes (mean, 79.7 minutes). All incisions healed by first intetion. All patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 19.0 months). There were 3 cases of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity after operation, and 1 case of approximately 10ø limitation of knee extension. At last follow-up, the posterior drawer test was positive in 2 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 1 case, with significant differences compared with the preoperative period ( ? 2=38.571, P=0.000; ? 2=36.274, P=0.000). The IKDC score was 84.67ñ3.67, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was normal in 16 cases, nearly normal in 10 cases, abnormal in 3 cases, and significantly abnormal in 1 case; the modified Lysholm knee score was 90.37ñ4.49; all of the above indexes were significantly better than preoperative ones, and the differences were significant ( t=-12.387, P=0.000; Z=-2.810, P=0.005; t=-22.865, P=0.000). Knee ROM was (88.33ñ9.86)ø at 1 month after operation and reached (113.33ñ13.48)ø at last follow-up, showing significant differences between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05). MRI re-examination showed that the form and position of reconstructed PCL were satisfactory. CONCLUSION: It can obtain good short-term effectiveness for PCL injuries by arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon, which has the advantages of reliable surgical approach, safe operation, and precise effectiveness.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7507/1002-1892.202011058,

(2021),2021,Peroneus longus tendon graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A case report and review of literature,"INTRODUCTION: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most frequently injured structures of the knee joint. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) provides surgical restoration of the injured ACL using the placement of graft material. The choice of graft is principal in providing optimal knee stability after surgery. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is an autograft modality that offers unique benefits for ACL reconstruction cases. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a case of ACL reconstruction surgery using PLT graft in a patient with a confirmed ACL rupture. Assessment of post-surgical pain, knee stability, and ankle function were performed to determine functional outcome and donor site morbidity. The follow-up results revealed favorable recovery and improvement in all objective parameters. DISCUSSION: Post-operative biomechanical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) score. The use of PLT in ACL reconstruction established an excellent potential for its satisfactory result and comparable to other graft modalities in widely used evidence-based findings. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon may be considered the first-option graft in ACL reconstruction as it indicated the absence of significant post-operative morbidity.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.106028,

(2020),2020,Combined hamstrings and peroneus longus tendon for undersized graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A report of two adolescence female patients,"INTRODUCTION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury in young and active population and reconstruction is the mainstay treatment to maintain stability of the knee. Hamstring tendon (HT) is the most popular graft for ACL reconstruction. In certain patient, particularly in women, the size of tendon graft to reconstruct the ACL is unpredictable. In the case of unqualified donor, we need a combined graft from another source to match the size requirement. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of ACL reconstruction using combination of HT and PLT graft in adolescent female. We evaluate knee functional score and ankle donor site morbidity. In the second case we also did second look for the ACL graft integrity arthroscopically. This study has been reported in line with the Surgical Case Report (SCARE) criteria. DISCUSSION: One year after surgery, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score for both cases were improved and no ankle-donor site morbidity with good motoric power and 100% American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Score (AOFAS).

(2020),2020,Single bundle ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon graft: 2-years follow-up,"BACKGROUND: Peroneus longus tendon autograft resembles hamstring tendon's biomechanical strength. Thus, peroneus longus is a potential graft in reconstructive orthopaedic procedures. However, there was few study in evaluation of peroneus longus usage in ACL reconstruction. This study aimed to quantify the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. METHODS: Patients who suffered isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent isolated single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft. Functional score (IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score) were assessed at pre-operative and 2-years after surgery. Graft diameter was measured intraoperative. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurement and ankle scoring using AOFAS and FADI. We also measured serial hop test. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Peroneus longus graft diameter was 8.38?ñ?0.68?mm. There was significant difference between pre and 2-years post-operative functional score in IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score. Mean of AOFAS was 98.93?ñ?3.10 and FADI was 99.79?ñ?0.59 with no significant decrease of thigh circumference, and good serial hop test result. CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft has excellent functional score in IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, Tegner-Lysholm score at 2-years follow up with the advantages of greater graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy, good serial hop test result, and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI score.

(2020),2020,Predicting the peroneus longus tendon autograft size in ACL reconstruction by using anthropometric parameters: A study in South Sulawesi population,"INTRODUCTION: Some literature use peroneus longus tendon (PLT) as the alternative to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to overcome inadequate autograft size potential risk by using hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. Among the available methods to predict PLT measurements, anthropometric parameters are one of the most accessible and feasible methods. The objective of this prospective study was to predict the PLT autograft sizes in single bundle ACL reconstruction by using preoperative anthropometric measurement. METHOD: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), shank circumference and shank length of 20 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter and length of the PLT autograft obtained. RESULT: Pearson correlation test has shown that body weight and height correlates to PLT length and diameter also autograft's length and diameter significantly (pÿ<ÿ0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that height, weight, TLL and shank length were signifcantly related to autograft diameter. While height and TLL were significantly related to autograft length. CONCLUSION: Height, weight, TLL and shank length can use to predict PLT autograft diameter. While height and TLL can use to predict PLT autograft length.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.jor.2020.03.011,
105,PM-105,Wang et al. (2020),2020,An Autograft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Results in Better Biomechanical Performance and Tendon-Bone Incorporation Than Does a Hybrid Graft in a Rat Model,"BACKGROUND: The biomechanical and tendon-bone incorporation properties of allograft-augmented hybrid grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction compared with traditional autografts are unknown. HYPOTHESIS: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction yields better results on biomechanical testing, radiographic analysis, and histological evaluation versus using a hybrid graft. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 66 adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with an autograft (AT group; n = 33) or a hybrid graft (HB group; n = 33). The grafts used in both groups were harvested from the peroneus longus tendon and were fixed by suturing to the surrounding periosteum. Samples were harvested for biomechanical testing, micro-computed tomography (CT), and histological evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Bone tunnels on the femoral and tibial sides were divided into 3 subregions: intra-articular (IA), midtunnel (MT), and extra-articular (EA). A cylinder-like volume of interest in the bone tunnel and a tubular-like volume of interest around the bone tunnel were used to evaluate new bone formation and bone remodeling, respectively, via micro-CT. RESULTS: In the AT group, there were significantly higher failure loads and stiffness at 8 weeks (failure load: 3.04 ñ 0.40 vs 2.09 ñ 0.54 N, respectively; P = .006) (stiffness: 3.43 ñ 0.56 vs 1.75 ñ 0.52 N/mm, respectively; P < .001) and 12 weeks (failure load: 9.10 ñ 1.13 vs 7.14 ñ 0.94 N, respectively; P = .008) (stiffness: 4.45 ñ 0.75 vs 3.36 ñ 0.29 N/mm, respectively; P = .008) than in the HB group. With regard to new bone formation in the bone tunnel, in the AT group, the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher than in the HB group on the tibial side at 8 weeks (IA: 22.21 ñ 4.98 vs 5.16 ñ 3.98, respectively; P < .001) (EA: 19.66 ñ 7.19 vs 10.85 ñ 2.16, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 30.50 ñ 5.04 vs 17.11 ñ 7.31, respectively; P = .010) (MT: 21.15 ñ 2.58 vs 15.55 ñ 4.48, respectively; P = .041) (EA: 20.75 ñ 3.87 vs 10.64 ñ 3.94, respectively; P = .003). With regard to bone remodeling around the tunnel, the BV/TV was also significantly higher on the tibial side at 8 weeks (MT: 33.17 ñ 8.05 vs 15.21 ñ 7.60, respectively; P = .007) (EA: 25.19 ñ 6.38 vs 13.94 ñ 7.10, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 69.46 ñ 4.45 vs 47.80 ñ 6.16, respectively; P < .001) (MT: 33.15 ñ 3.88 vs 13.76 ñ 4.07, respectively; P < .001) in the AT group than in the HB group. Sharpey-like fibers had formed at 8 weeks in the AT group. A large number of fibroblasts withdrew at 12 weeks. In the AT group, the width of the interface was significantly narrower at 4 weeks (85.86 ñ 17.49 vs 182.97 ñ 14.35 ?m, respectively; P < .001), 8 weeks (58.86 ñ 10.99 vs 90.15 ñ 11.53 ?m, respectively; P = .002), and 12 weeks (42.70 ñ 7.96 vs 67.29 ñ 6.55 ?m, respectively; P = .001) than in the HB group. CONCLUSION: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction may result in improved biomechanical properties and tendon-bone incorporation compared with a hybrid graft. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Augmenting small autografts with allograft tissue may result in decreased biomechanical performance and worse tendon-bone incorporation, increasing the risk of graft failure.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/0363546520967668,

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 35 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy between October 2017 and October 2018. There were 19 males and 16 females with an average age of 43.4 years (range, 18-60 years), with 20 cases of left knee and 15 cases of right knee. The causes of injury included traffic accident in 14 cases, falling injury in 13 cases, and sports injury in 8 cases. The time from injury to operation ranged from 3 to 9 days (mean, 4.7 days). The patients suffered from swelling, pain, and limited mobility of knee joint before operation. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were positive before operation, whereas MRI was taken to confirm the ACL rupture. After operation, the patients were followed up every 3 months until the knee joint's function returned to normal. MRI and X-ray films were used to observe the tendon-bone healing as well as the position of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were conducted to observe the improvement of knee joint mobility. The functional improvements were evaluated by the International Knee Documents Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, knee injury and osteoarthritis (KOOS) score. RESULTS: All the 35 patients were followed up 12-18 months, with an average of 14.2 months. The incisions healed by first intention, and no complications such as infection, joint stiffness, and rerupture occurred. Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test turned to be negative of all patients. MRI showed that the ACL was continuous, and the tendon-bone in the distal femur tunnel and proximal tibia tunnel recovered well after operation. X-ray films showed that the positions of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail were stable. The IKDC, Lysholm, and KOOS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation were significantly improved when compared with those before operation, and the scores were further improved with time after operation ( P<0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with ACL rupture, ACL reconstruction with the autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy has satisfactory effectiveness of quick recovery, good function, and great stability.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7507/1002-1892.201911145,

(2020),2020,[Effect of vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft reconstruction on anterior cruciate ligament insertion in rabbits],"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft reconstruction on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insertion in rabbits. METHODS: Eighty healthy New Zealand white rabbits were harvested to prepare ACL injury models and randomly divided into two groups ( n=40). The ACL was reconstructed with vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft in group A and peroneus longus tendon graft without blood supply in group B. The survival of animals and the healing of incision were observed after operation; the grafts were taken for gross and histological observations at 4, 8, and 16 weeks; the biomechanical test of the grafts was carried out to record the maximum tensile strength and incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks. RESULTS: All animals survived until the experiment completed. General observation showed that the tunnel was combined with grafts, the vascular infiltration was abundant, and no obvious boundary between the tunnel and grafts existed at 16 weeks in group A; there was still an obvious boundary between the tunnel and graft in group B. Histological observation showed that the collagen fibers between tendon and bone in group A increased gradually, the dense fiber connection was formed, and the ""tidal-line"" like structure similar to the normal ACL insertion was formed at 16 weeks; but the""tidal-line"" like structure was not obvious in group B. Biomechanical test showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks between group A and group B ( P=0.680; P=0.590), but the maximum tensile strength at 8 and 16 weeks were higher in group A than in group B ( t=18.503, P=0.001; t=25.391, P=0.001). CONCLUSION: The vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft for ACL reconstruction can obviously promote the outcome of the ACL insertion.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7507/1002-1892.201912048,

(2019),2019,"Supplemental Fixation of Inner Graft Limbs in All-Inside, Quadrupled, Single-Tendon Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Graft Construct Yields Improved Biomechanical Properties","PURPOSE: To compare the time-zero load to failure of a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction graft construct with (supplemented) and without the incorporation of inner-limb whipstitch sutures (control) into a tibial suspensory fixation button. METHODS: Eight matched pairs of peroneus longus tendons were prepared according to a quadrupled, all-inside ACL soft-tissue graft technique with 1 side serving as a control and the contralateral side supplemented. The constructs were biomechanically tested for strain in the inner and outer limbs during a preconditioning protocol, single-cycle load to failure, and elongation of the whole construct. RESULTS: Ultimate load toÿfailure was significantly higher in the supplemented group: 797.5 ñ 49.6ÿN (95% confidence interval [CI], 763.13-831.87ÿN) versus 719.6 ñ 69.6ÿN (95% CI, 671.38-767.82ÿN; Pÿ= .044). Less graft elongation at failure was observed in the supplemented group (3.1 ñ 1.5ÿmm; 95% CI, 2.07-4.17ÿmm) versus the control group (21.0 ñ 21.2ÿmm; 95% CI, 6.31-35.69ÿmm; Pÿ= .052). The number of grafts undergoing a 5-mm or greater change in length at failure was 1 of 8 in the supplemented group versus 5 of 8 in the control group (Pÿ= .038). CONCLUSIONS: Inner-limb supplemental tibial fixation results in higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation in a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside ACL reconstruction graft construct. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The weak point of a single-tendon, quadrupled, all-inside ACL graft construct is the tendon-to-tendon suturing to secure the inner limbs of the graft. Adding supplemental fixation by incorporating the sutures from the inner limb to the tibial suspensory fixation button leads to a higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.arthro.2018.10.130,
109,PM-109,Rhatomy et al. (2019),2019,Peroneus longus autograft can be recommended as a superior graft to hamstring tendon in single-bundle ACL reconstruction,"PURPOSE: A peroneus longus tendon autograft is used in many orthopaedic procedures and it is biomechanically comparable to a hamstring tendon autograft. Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity of ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts versus peroneus longus tendon autografts in patients with an isolated ACL injury. METHODS: Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1ÿyear after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (hamstring n?=?28, peroneus n?=?24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8?ñ?0.7ÿmm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2?ñ?0.8ÿmm) (p?=?0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3?ñ?4.2 and for the FADI 98?ñ?3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p?=?0.002). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.

(2019),2019,Eversion and First Ray Plantarflexion Muscle Strength in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using a Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"BACKGROUND: The peroneus longus tendon has been used as a graft in orthopaedic reconstruction surgery because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hamstring tendon. However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 ñ 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .55), with means of 65.87 ñ 7.63 N and 66.96 ñ 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .68), with means of 150.64 ñ 11.67 N and 152.10 ñ 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 ñ 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 ñ 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. CONCLUSION: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity. This suggests that the peroneus longus tendon is a promising graft in ACL reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/2325967119872462,

(2019),2019,Influence of anthropometric features on peroneus longus graft diameter in Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction: A cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is the most common ligament injury during sports activities that was treated with ACL reconstruction. Nowadays, peroneus longus is used in ACL reconstruction. However, it is difficult to predict the peroneus longus graft diameter for ACL reconstruction. Thus, preoperative measurements are very important to predict peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: A cohort retrospective study was conducted using consecutive sampling method from February 2016 until October 2017 in our center. We recorded patients' characteristics include gender, age, body weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) preoperatively. We measured peroneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively, and analysed data using Spearman correlation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. There were 28 males and 11 females in the peroneus group. From the patients' mean characteristics, age was 25.10?ñ?9.16, body weight 71.23?ñ?14.17, height 169.13?ñ?8.81, and BMI 20.96?ñ?3.44. Intraoperative peroneus longus diameter measurement was 8.56?ñ?0.82. Spearman correlation showed significant correlation between intraoperative peroneus longus diameter with patient's height, body weight, and BMI with p?<?0.05.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of this alternative autograft compared with autologous hamstring tendon (HT). Biomechanical testing of the graft options was performed and compared with the native ACL. Thirty-eight patients with acute ACL ruptures and grade III MCL injuries were treated with ACL reconstruction with a doubled autologous PLT or quadrupled autologous HT. Knee stability and function was evaluated clinically with the Lachman test and KT-2000 arthometer as well as subjectively with functional scores. Effects on the donor ankle were evaluated by biomechanical testing. The ultimate tensile strengths of doubled PLT and quadrupled HT were significantly higher than that of the native ACL and the ultimate tensile strength of doubled PLT was comparable with that of quadrupled HT. There were no significant differences in clinical or functional scores between the two groups. There were no significant differences in pre- and postoperative biomechanical testing of the donor ankle. PLT is a suitable alternative autograft for an ACL reconstruction in patients with a concomitant grade III MCL injury without a significant biomechanical disadvantage to the ankle donor site.,PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1055/s-0038-1669951,
114,PM-114,Sun et al. (2019),2019,Anti-GAPDH Autoantibody Is Associated with Increased Disease Activity and Intracranial Pressure in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune disease characterized by multiorgan involvement. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers. The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE. However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive. In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE. METHODS: Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE. White blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (HB), platelet count (PLT), IgG, IgA, IgM, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), RF, anti-cardiolipin (Acl), ANA, AnuA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, ?2-GPI, urinalysis, and 24?h urine protein were measured by standard laboratory techniques. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index scores were evaluated accordingly. RESULTS: The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (P = 0.0011). Elevated serum anti-GAPDH was correlated with increased SLEDAI-2K (P = 0.017), ESR, IgG, and IgM and associated with increased intracranial pressure and incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, but it was protective for seizure disorder incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity. It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1155/2019/7430780,
115,PM-115,Trung et al. (2019),2019,Preliminary Result of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Anterior Half of Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the most successful operations in sports medicine. At present, ligament autografts have been the best method due to good histocompatibility, rapid healing, no cross-contamination, and low cost of treatment. However, autografts do not have infinite amount and are also not always feasible. Anterior half of peroneus longus tenden autograft is likely to become a source of autograft with many advantages. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT). AIM: To evaluate the initial outcome of ACL reconstruction arthroscopy by anterior half of peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This is a prospective non-controlled case series. RESULTS: A prospective study on 30 patients (from 9 / 2016 to 01 / 2019) had both ACL and MCL injury who had operated ACL reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT) at Department of General Orthopaedic and Trauma, Viet Duc hospital. Our outcome: the year average 35.4 ys, the rate of ACL rupture combined with meniscus injury was 40%. The average diameter AHPLT autograft is 7.0 mm. The function Lysholm scores improved from 59 to 94.27 postoperative 6 months. No difference beetwen the AOFAS scale of preoperative and postoperative. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon is recommended to be a safe and practical autograft resource for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.3889/oamjms.2019.390,
116,PM-116,Wong et al. (2019),2019,Biomechanical and geometric characterization of peroneus longus allografts with respect to age,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are among the most common injuries in high impact sports, and reconstruction is the standard surgical procedure for these ruptures. Reconstructions are often performed using allografts rather than autografts on a case-by-case basis. Controversy exists as to whether or not age of donor tissue plays a factor in the mechanical properties of allografts. METHODS: 38 peroneus longus (PL) tendons were prepared using the two-strand graft technique and then subjected to a cyclic loading test regimen of 1000?cycles to determine material properties. Specimens were grouped based on age to ascertain whether donor age affects the material properties of PL tendons. FINDINGS: Secant modulus of the first cycle was determined to be 150.43 (SD 40.24) MPa. The average magnitude of the dynamic modulus was determined to be 82.81 (SD 24.65) MPa. Specimens were grouped into three distinct groups for analysis (x?<?40 yo, 40 yo?ó?x?<?60 yo, 60 yo?<?x). INTERPRETATION: The need for using intrinsic material properties is highlighted. There is no significant difference in any intrinsic material property with respect to age or the fatigue of the tendon as the cycle count increases. Conversely, the measured stiffness of a tendon decreased as function of age with a large effect size. Based on analysis of graft geometries, it was determined that PL tendons become significantly more slender with increased age which result in the observed decrease in stiffness.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2019.04.017,

(2019),2019,[Arthroscopic GraftLink technique reconstruction combined with suture anchor fixation for anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament injuries],"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of arthroscopic GraftLink technique reconstruction combined with suture anchor fixation in treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture and medial collateral ligament (MCL) grade ? injury. METHODS: Between June 2015 and February 2018, 28 patients with ACL rupture and MCL grade ? injury were treated. Arthroscopic GraftLink technique was used to reconstruct ACL with autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT), and suture anchor fixation was used to repair MCL. There were 22 males and 6 females, aged 21-47 years, with an average age of 30.4 years. The cause of injury included traffic accident in 18 cases, falling from height in 7 cases, and sports injury in 3 cases. The time from injury to admission was 1-2 weeks, with an average of 1.3 weeks. The preoperative Lysholm score of knee joint was 46.8ñ3.0 and the International Knee Documentation Commission (IKDC) score was 49.2ñ2.7. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of ankle joint was 98.29ñ0.72. Both Lachman test and valgus stress test were positive. There were 8 cases of meniscus injury and 2 cases of cartilage injury. RESULTS: The operation time ranged from 55 to 90 minutes, with an average of 72.5 minutes. All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no complications related to operation occurred. All patients were followed up 6-38 months, with an average of 20.7 months. At 3 months after operation, the range of motion of the knee joint was 116- 132ø, with an average of 122ø. Lachman test showed that the anterior translation more than 5 mm in 2 cases, and the others were negative; while the valgus stress test showed that all patients were positive. At 6 months after operation, the Lysholm score and IKDC score of knee joint were 90.2ñ1.8 and 93.5ñ2.3, respectively, which were significantly higher than preoperative scores ( t=31.60, P=0.00; t=29.91, P=0.01); AOFAS score of ankle joint was 97.86ñ0.68, with no significant difference compared with preoperative score ( t=2.89, P=0.08). KT-1000 test showed that the difference of anterior relaxation between bilateral knee joints was less than 2 mm in 25 cases and 3 to 5 mm in 3 cases. CONCLUSION: The method of ACL reconstruction via arthroscopic GraftLink technique with PLT and MCL repair via suture anchor fixation has the advantages of less knee injury and faster recovery, and there is no significant impact on ankle function after tendon removal.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.7507/1002-1892.201812062,

(2018),2018,All-Inside Single-Bundle Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with the Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Compared to the Semitendinosus Tendon: A Two-Year Follow-Up Study,"The anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) has been reported to be acceptable for ligament reconstruction with respect to strength and safety. However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0?ñ?3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Tunnel positions, which were confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomical positions. At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4?ñ?7.1 vs. 89.3.?ñ?8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71?ñ?0.57 vs. 1.85?ñ?0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15?ñ?0.36 vs. 0.10?ñ?0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1?ñ?1.40 vs. 99.5?ñ?1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up.

(2018),2018,Clinical Outcomes Following Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Hamstring Autograft versus Planned Hybrid Graft,"Few studies have compared outcomes between autografts versus hybrid grafts (combination of autograft and allograft) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this study was to compare revision rate and patient-reported outcomes following primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft versus a preoperatively planned hybrid autograft-allograft. At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with a double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring autograft (A) or a planned hybrid (H) graft (single-strand semitendinosus with nonirradiated peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up. From this collection of patients, a matched-pair comparison was made between groups, with patients matched by gender, age at the time of surgery, and follow-up time. Revision rate at follow-up was 8.4 and 2.4% in the A and H groups, respectively (p?=?0.073). A total of 148 surveys were completed (83 A, 65 H), from which 36 matched pairs were formed. Within the matched pairs, average age at surgery did not differ significantly between groups (A: 35.7 years, H: 36.0 years, p?=?0.23). Time to follow-up was 4.3 and 3.7 years in the A and H groups, respectively. Patients with a hybrid graft had significantly higher KOOS Quality of Life subscores (A 69.6, H 79.2, p?=?0.028), subjective IKDC scores (A 72.6, H 79.7, p?=?0.031), and SANE scores (A 83.2, H 91.4, p?=?0.015) at follow-up. Otherwise, no significant differences were found in patient-reported outcome scores between groups. A preoperatively planned hybrid graft, with use of a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated allograft, should be considered as a viable alternative for primary ACLR in older patients.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1055/s-0037-1617417,

METHODS: The levels of serum s-Eng were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 139 patients with APS, 44 patients with SLE but no APS, 37 patients with primary Sj”gren's syndrome (pSS), 23 patients with Bechet's disease (BD), 22 patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and 22 persistent anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) positive individuals without SLE or APS (simply aCL positive group) and 87 health controls (HC) without any auto-immune diseases. These APS patients included 64 primary APS patients and 75 APS patients secondary to SLE.The correlation between the clinical data, laboratory parameters, and serum s-Eng levels were analyzed.Independent samples t test, paired t test, Chi-square Test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's ?2 test were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: (1) The serum levels of s-Eng were significantly higher in the patients with APS whether primary or secondary to SLE than in the health controls and simply aCL positive group and the patients with other autoimmune diseases, including SLE, pSS, BD and SSc (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the serum s-Eng levels between simply aCL positive group and health controls [(5.17ñ2.00) mg/L vs. (5.04ñ1.11) mg/L, P>0.05]. (2) The best cut-off value for the diagnosis of APS was no less than 8.37 mg/L as mean ñ 3SD value, with the sensitivity at 0.772 and the specificity at 0.928. The Youden index was 0.700. These results indicated good validity of s-Eng as a diagnostic marker for APS. (3) The proportions of artery thrombosis and pathological pregnancy were higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than that in s-Eng-negative group (46/81 vs. 19/58, 29/65 vs. 10/44, respectively, all P<0.05). The levels of PLT were lower in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients (72.00?109/L vs. 119.00?109/L, P<0.001). (4) The proportions of the presence (93.83% vs. 37.93%, P<0.001) and titer (61.70 U/mL vs. 15.45 U/mL, P<0.001) of aCL were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group. The proportions of the presence (61.73% vs. 43.10%, P<0.05) and titer (33.48 U/mL vs.17.40 U/mL, P<0.05) of anti-?2-glycoprotein I antibody were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group too. CONCLUSION: s-Eng serum levels were significantly increased in the patients with APS, and it may play a role as acomplementary serological marker for the diagnosis and risk prediction of APS.",PubMed/MEDLINE,,
121,PM-121,Lord et al. (2018),2018,ACL graft compression: a method to allow reduced tunnel sizes in ACL reconstruction,"PURPOSE: A common problem during ACL reconstruction is asymmetry of proximal-distal graft diameter leading to tunnel upsizing and graft-tunnel mismatch. Compression downsizing provides a graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique and its effects on graft biomechanics and stability. It was hypothesised that compression downsizing would significantly reduce cross-sectional area (CSA); that no significant changes in graft biomechanics would occur; graft fixation stability would be improved. METHOD: Sixty-eight non-irradiated peroneus longus (PL) tendons were investigated. Twenty were halved and paired into ten four-strand grafts, 20 strands were compressed by 0.5-1ÿmm diameter and changes in CSA recorded using an alginate mould technique. The following properties were compared with 20 control strands: cyclic strain when loaded 70-220ÿN for 1000 cycles; stiffness; ultimate tensile load and stress; Young's modulus. 24 PL tendons were quadrupled into grafts, 12 were compressed and all 24 were submerged in Ringer's solution at 37ÿøC and the CSA recorded over 12ÿh. Twelve compressed and 12 control quadrupled grafts were mounted in porcine femurs, placed in Ringer's solution for 12ÿh at 37ÿøC and graft displacement at the bone tunnel aperture recorded under cyclic loading. RESULTS: Mean decreases in CSA of 31% under a stress of 471ÿkPa and 21% under a stress of 447ÿkPa were observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19% over 12ÿh compared to 2% for controls. No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability; mean cyclic displacements were 0.3ÿmm for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: No detrimental biomechanical effects of graft compression on allograft PL tendons were observed. Following compression, the grafts significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability between groups. Graft compression did not cause adverse mechanical effects in vitro. Smaller tunnels for compressed grafts reduce bone loss and ease anatomical placement.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1007/s00167-018-4932-4,
122,PM-122,Song et al. (2018),2018,Predicting the graft diameter of the peroneus longus tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between various anthropometric parameters and the graft diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT).We retrospectively analyzed the data of 156 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with the PLT graft at our institution. Anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, gender, age, duration of injury, and preinjury activity levels, were recorded. t tests, correlation coefficients (Pearson r), and a multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter of the graft obtained.The mean PLT graft diameter was 8.3?mm, and 21 patients (13.5%) had a diameter less than 8?mm; 85 patients (54.5%) had a diameter between 8 and 9?mm, and 50 patients (32.0%) had a diameter greater than or equal to 9?mm. The correlation analysis showed that height (P?<?.001), weight (P?<?.001), and duration of injury (P?=?.012) were significantly related to graft diameter. On the basis of these 3 predictors, the following regression equation was obtained: Diameter?=?2.28?+?0.028*height (cm)?+?0.013*weight (kg)?+?0.289*duration of injury (0 or 1). Patients who were short and shin were more likely to own smaller graft diameters (<8?mm), especially the one ruptured his or her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) over 3 months.Height, weight, and duration of injury were associated with the diameter of PLT. They are important preoperative information for surgeon about the size of PLT and can be used for alternative graft source planning and patient counseling.Level of evidence: IV.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1097/MD.0000000000012672,
123,PM-123,Moatshe et al. (2017),2017,Multiple Ligament Reconstruction Femoral Tunnels: Intertunnel Relationships and Guidelines to Avoid Convergence,"BACKGROUND: Knee dislocations often require multiple concurrent ligament reconstructions, which involve creating several tunnels in the distal femur. Therefore, the risk of tunnel convergence is increased because of the limited bone volume within the distal aspect of the femur. PURPOSE: To assess the risk of tunnel convergence and determine the optimal reconstruction tunnel orientations for multiple ligament reconstructions in the femur. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Three-dimensional knee models were developed from computed tomography scans of 21 patients. Medical image processing software was used to create tunnels for each of the primary ligamentous structures, replicating a surgical approach that would be used in multiple ligament reconstructions. Thereafter, the tunnel orientation was varied in surgically relevant directions to determine orientations that minimized the risk of tunnel convergence. The orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tunnels was held constant throughout the study, while the orientation of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL) tunnels was varied to avoid convergence. RESULTS: A high risk of tunnel convergence was observed between the FCL and ACL tunnels when the FCL tunnel was aimed at 0ø in the axial and coronal planes. Aiming the FCL tunnel 35ø anteriorly minimized convergence with the ACL tunnel. No tunnel convergence was observed for the PLT tunnel aimed 35ø anteriorly and parallel to the FCL tunnel. To avoid convergence between the sMCL and PCL tunnels, the sMCL tunnels should be aimed 40ø proximally in the coronal plane and 20ø to 40ø anteriorly. During concomitant POL reconstruction, the sMCL should be aimed 40ø proximally and anteriorly and the POL 20ø proximally and anteriorly. The PLT and POL tunnels aimed at 0ø in both the coronal and axial planes had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CONCLUSION: Femoral tunnel orientations during multiple ligament reconstructions need to be adjusted to avoid tunnel convergence. On the lateral side, aiming the FCL and PLT tunnels 35ø anteriorly eliminated convergence with the ACL tunnel. On the medial side, tunnel convergence was avoided by orienting the sMCL tunnel 40ø proximally and anteriorly and the POL tunnel 20ø proximally and anteriorly. The POL and PLT tunnels aimed at 0ø in the axial plane had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The risk of tunnel convergence with the ACL and PCL femoral tunnels can be reduced by adjusting the orientation of the FCL and PLT tunnels and the sMCL and POL tunnels, respectively.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/0363546516673616,
124,PM-124,Palmer et al. (2017),2017,A Biomechanical Comparison of Allograft Tendons for Ligament Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Allograft tendons are frequently used for ligament reconstruction about the knee, but they entail availability and cost challenges. The identification of other tissues that demonstrate equivalent performance to preferred tendons would improve limitations. Hypothesis/Purpose: We compared the biomechanical properties of 4 soft tissue allograft tendons: tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), and semitendinosus (ST). We hypothesized that allograft properties would be similar when standardized by the looped diameter. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: This study consisted of 2 arms evaluating large and small looped-diameter grafts: experiment A consisted of TA, TP, and PL tendons (n = 47 each) with larger looped diameters of 9.0 to 9.5 mm, and experiment B consisted of TA, TP, PL, and ST tendons (n = 53 each) with smaller looped diameters of 7.0 to 7.5 mm. Each specimen underwent mechanical testing to measure the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile force (UTF), maximal elongation at failure, ultimate tensile stress (UTS), and ultimate tensile strain (UTî). RESULTS: Experiment A: No significant differences were noted among tendons for UTF, maximal elongation at failure, and UT?. UTS was significantly higher for the PL (54 MPa) compared with the TA (44 MPa) and TP (43 MPa) tendons. E was significantly higher for the PL (501 MPa) compared with the TP (416 MPa) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TP and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the TA tendons for all outcomes. Experiment B: All groups exhibited a similar E. UTF was again highest in the PL tendons (2294 N) but was significantly different from only the ST tendons (1915 N). UT? was significantly higher for the ST (0.22) compared with the TA (0.19) and TP (0.19) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TA, TP, and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the ST tendons. CONCLUSION: Compared with TA tendons, TP and PL tendons of a given looped diameter exhibited noninferior initial biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics. ST tendons were mostly similar to TA tendons but exhibited a significantly higher elongation/UT? and smaller cross-sectional area. For smaller looped-diameter grafts, all tissues were noninferior to ST tendons. In contrast to previous findings, PL tendons proved to be equally strong. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this study should encourage surgeons to use these soft tissue allografts interchangeably, which is important as the number of ligament reconstructions performed with allografts continues to rise.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/0363546516671944,
125,PM-125,Russell et al. (2017),2017,Baseline cartilage quality is associated with voxel-based T(1?) and T(2) following ACL reconstruction: A multicenter pilot study,"In this multi-center study, voxel-based relaxometry (VBR), a novel technique to automatically quantify localized cartilage change, was used to investigate T1? and T2 relaxation times of patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears at the time of injury and 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Sixty-four ACL-injured patients from three sites underwent bilateral 3T MR T1? and T2 mapping; 56 patients returned 6 months after surgery. Cross-sectional and longitudinal VBR comparisons of relaxation times were calculated. Noyes Score (NS) clinical grades of cartilage lesions were noted at both times and correlated with relaxation times. Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T1? times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T1? increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T1? and T2 after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the speed and localized specificity of automatic VBR analysis may translate well for clinical application, as seen in this multicenter study. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

126,PM-126,Trulsson et al. (2017),2017,Associations between altered movement patterns during single-leg squat and muscle activity at weight-transfer initiation in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament injury,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about factors contributing to the altered movement patterns observed in many individuals with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. We addressed whether altered muscular activity is such a factor. METHODS: 16 participants with unilateral, non-reconstructed ACL rupture were scored for altered movement patterns according to Test for Substitution Patterns (TSP), which includes the single-leg squat (SLS). Surface electromyography (SEMG), was recorded in the lower extremities at initiation of weight-transfer from double-leg to single-leg stance (eyes closed), simulating the initiation of an SLS. Normalised SEMG amplitudes 200-300?ms after weight-transfer initiation were compared between injured and non-injured sides, and correlated to the TSP scores for the SLS. Peak absolute SEMG amplitudes during 5 TSP test movements were also compared between sides. RESULTS: At weight-transfer initiation, muscle activity was lower in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles on the injured side. Low muscle activity correlated moderately to worse TSP scores for the SLS for the gluteus medius (rs=-0.56, p=0.03), and gastrocnemius muscles (rs=-0.56, p=0.02). Median peak absolute amplitude during TSP movements was lower in the quadriceps, gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles on the injured side. CONCLUSIONS: The altered patterns of muscle activity at weight-transfer initiation, correlations between lower activity at movement initiation and altered movement patterns during SLS and the altered peak amplitudes during TSP movements together indicate alterations in sensorimotor control that may contribute to the observed altered movement patterns. Future studies will determine if exercises targeting muscle activity initiation should complement customary ACL injury rehabilitation.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1136/bmjsem-2016-000131,
127,PM-127,Aguila et al. (2016),2016,Effects of gamma irradiation on the biomechanical properties of peroneus tendons,"PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the biomechanical properties of nonirradiated (NI) and irradiated (IR) peroneus tendons to determine if they would be suitable allografts, in regards to biomechanical properties, for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction after a dose of 1.5-2.5 Mrad. METHODS: Seven pairs of peroneus longus (PL) and ten pairs of peroneus brevis (PB) tendons were procured from human cadavers. The diameter of each allograft was measured. The left side of each allograft was IR at 1.5-2.5 Mrad, whereas the right side was kept aseptic and NI. The allografts were thawed, kept wet with saline, and attached in a single-strand fashion to custom freeze grips using liquid nitrogen. A preload of 10 N was then applied and, after it had reached steady state, the allografts were pulled at 4 cm/sec. The parameters recorded were the displacement and force. RESULTS: The elongation at the peak load was 10.3ñ2.3 mm for the PB NI side and 13.5ñ3.3 mm for the PB IR side. The elongation at the peak load was 17.4ñ5.3 mm for the PL NI side and 16.3ñ2.0 mm for the PL IR side. For PL, the ultimate load was 2,091.6ñ148.7 N for NI and 2,122.8ñ380.0 N for IR. The ultimate load for the PB tendons was 1,485.7ñ209.3 N for NI and 1,318.4ñ296.9 N for the IR group. The ultimate stress calculations for PL were 90.3ñ11.3 MPa for NI and 94.8ñ21.0 MPa for IR. For the PB, the ultimate stress was 82.4ñ19.0 MPa for NI and 72.5ñ16.6 MPa for the IR group. The structural stiffness was 216.1ñ59.0 N/mm for the NI PL and 195.7ñ51.4 N/mm for the IR side. None of these measures were significantly different between the NI and IR groups. The structural stiffness was 232.1ñ45.7 N/mm for the NI PB and 161.9ñ74.0 N/mm for the IR side, and this was the only statistically significant difference found in this study (P=0.034). CONCLUSION: Our statistical comparisons found no significant differences in terms of elongation, ultimate load, or ultimate stress between IR and NI PB and PL tendons. Only the PB structural stiffness was affected by irradiation. Thus, sterilizing allografts at 1.5-2.5 Mrad of gamma irradiation does not cause major alterations in the tendons' biomechanical properties while still providing a suitable amount of sterilization for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.2147/OAJSM.S109156,
128,PM-128,Ames et al. (2016),2016,Survival in primary antiphospholipid syndrome. A single-centre cohort study,"The vascular mortality of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) ranges from 1.4?% to 5.5?%, but its predictors are poorly known. It was the study objective to evaluate the impact of baseline lupus anticoagulant assays, IgG anticardiolipin (aCL), plasma fibrinogen (FNG) and von Willebrand factor (VWF), platelets (PLT) and of genetic polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, of prothrombin G20210A and of paraoxonase-1 Q192R on survival in primary APS (PAPS). Cohort study on 77 thrombotic PAPS and 33 asymptomatic carriers of aPL (PCaPL) seen from 1989 to 2015 and persistently positive for aPL as per annual review. At baseline all participants were tested twice for the ratios of kaolin clotting time (KCTr), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTTr), dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVTr), IgG aCL, FNG, VWF and once for PLT. All thrombotic PAPS were on warfarin with regular INR monitoring. During follow-up 11 PAPS deceased (D-PAPS) of recurrent thrombosis mostly arterial, despite adequate anticoagulation yielding an overall vascular mortality of 10?%. D-PAPS had the strongest baseline aPTTr and DRVVTr and the highest mean baseline IgG aCL, FNG, VWF and PLT. Cox proportional hazards model identified baseline DRVVTr and FNG as main predictors of mortality with adjusted hazard ratios of 5.75 (95?% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 22.4) and of 1.03 (95?%CI: 1.01, 1.04), respectively. In conclusion, plasma DRVVTr and FNG are strongly associated with the risk of vascular death in PAPS; while FNG lowering agents exist further research should be directed at therapeutic strategies able to dampen aPL production.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1160/TH15-10-0839,
129,PM-129,Gali et al. (2016),2016,Tunnel collision during simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner reconstruction,"PURPOSE: To verify the safest angle to drill femoral tunnels in simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstructions to minimize the risk of tunnel collision and to examine the relationship between lateral femoral condyle (LFC) width and tunnel collision occurrence. METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulations and 10ø axial/30ø coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. RESULTS: Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10ø axial/30ø coronal angulation (P < 0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1007/s00167-014-3363-0,
130,PM-130,Su et al. (2016),2016,The association between MR T1? and T2 of cartilage and patient-reported outcomes after ACL injury and reconstruction,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if cartilage T1? and T2 relaxation time measures after ACL injury and prior to reconstruction (baseline) are associated with patient-reported outcomes at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after surgery. DESIGN: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1? and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1? or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1? or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. RESULTS: Higher baseline SSD T1? posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1? pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year. CONCLUSION: T1? and T2 of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS after injury and both KOOS and Marx after reconstruction. Such associations may help clinicians stratify outcomes post-injury, and thus, improve patient management.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.joca.2016.01.985,
131,PM-131,Angthong et al. (2015),2015,The Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with the Peroneus Longus Tendon: A Biomechanical and Clinical Evaluation of the Donor Ankle Morbidity,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to report on ankle and foot functions via the holistic evaluations using clinical examination, functional scores assessment and isokinetic tests after harvesting autogenous peroneus longus tendons for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction focusing on the donor site morbidity with a minimum 1-year follow-up period. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included 24 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft and endobutton fixation. Results of ACL reconstruction were assessed via physical examination. Donor site morbidity of the foot and ankle after tendon-harvesting was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot-and-Ankle Society (AOFAS) for ankle-hindfoot score and Visual Analogue Score-Foot Ankle (VAS-FA). Isokinetic testing for the ankle was performed in 10 voluntary patients after surgery. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 12.8 months. Regarding the latest follow-up, anterior drawer tests of ankle showed normal findings in 83.3%, and 1+ anterior laxity in 16.7% of all patients. Mean pre- and postoperative AOFAS scores were 100.0 ñ 0.0 and 96.0 ñ 9.6, respectively at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.06). Mean pre- and postoperative VAS-FA scores were 99.7 ñ 1.1 and 95.4 ñ 12.0, respectively at - 13-month follow-up (p = 0.09). At 7-month follow-up by isokinetic testing, peak torques of eversion and inversion were significantly lower on the harvested ankle compared with the contralateral ankle at both velocities (60 degrees/second and 120 degrees/second, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on overall findings in the present study, the authors could not recommend the peroneus longus tendon as the first option of donor graft for ACL reconstruction due to the several morbidities particularly in the first 12 months after the operation. However, the peroneus longus tendon may be the option after other graft harvestings for the ligament reconstruction, which needs several tendon grafts in a patient with multi-directional instability of the knee due to some specific situation such as a traumatic knee dislocation.",PubMed/MEDLINE,,
132,PM-132,Crall and Gilmer (2015),2015,Anatomic All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Quadriceps Tendon Autograft,"All-inside anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has recently gained popularity, in part because of its bone-sparing socket preparation and reported lower pain levels after surgery. However, because this technique uses suture loops and cortical suspension buttons for graft fixation, it has mostly been limited to looped graft constructs (e.g., hamstring autograft, peroneus longus allograft). Quadriceps tendon autograft offers several advantages in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction but, until recently, has not been compatible with suture-loop and cortical suspensory fixation. We describe a technique that allows a relatively short (<75 mm) quadriceps tendon autograft (without bone block) to be used with established all-inside anatomic techniques.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.eats.2015.08.004,

Significantly delayed MAOT were found in the ACLI group compared to the control group for vastus lateralis, vastus medialis obliquus, hamstrings medial, hamstrings lateral, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and gastrocnemius in both vision conditions, for gluteus maximus and gluteus medius with eyes open and for tensor fascia latae with eyes closed. Within the ACLI group, delayed MAOT of tibialis anterior with eyes open and gastrocnemius with eyes closed were found in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg. All other muscles were not significantly different between legs. In conclusion, the ACLI group showed delayed MAOT not only around the knee, but also at the hip and ankle muscles compared to the non-injured control group. No differences between both legs of the ACLI group were found, except for tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. These findings indirectly support including central nervous system re-education training to target the underlying mechanisms of these altered MAOT after ACL injury.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.humov.2015.09.007,
134,PM-134,Liu et al. (2015),2015,Half-peroneus-longus-tendon graft augmentation for unqualified hamstring tendon graft of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: In some situations, harvested hamstring tendon grafts are not qualified for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This study aimed to present a reinforcing method with additional half peroneus longus tendon (half-PLT) graft augmentation. METHODS: Eight cases underwent ACL reconstruction with unqualified hamstring tendon grafts (diameter <7 mm) and were salvaged by additional half-PLT graft augmentation. The pivot shift test and KT-1000 tests were performed 3 years after surgery. Functional evaluation of subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores was also done. In addition, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were used to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. RESULTS: The diameter of unqualified four-strand hamstring tendon grafts was 6.2 mm on average (range, 6.0-6.5 mm). The average diameter of hamstring grafts with half-PLT augmentation was 9.6 mm (range, 9.5-10.0 mm). The pivot shift test was negative in all patients. No significant differences between normal and abnormal knees were found by KT-1000. The average IKDC score was 86.0 (range, 83 to 89), and the average Lysholm score was 84.4 (range, 80-90). The average FADI score for the donor sites of half-PLT was 135.8 (range, 134-136).

STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo mechanical testing study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Canine PLT segments (n?=?21 dogs; 42 PLT). METHODS: Morphometric measurements of PLT segments were taken from computed tomography (CT) images and compared with results obtained using calipers. PLT were tested to failure at a rate of 100% length/s. Mechanical properties and failure mode were recorded. RESULTS: PLT width and thickness (P?<?.001 for both) measured by calipers were significantly lower than those taken from CT images. Thirty-five (83%) specimens failed by avulsion fracture from the patella, 1 failed mid-ligament, and 6 failed by tibial fracture. Dog weight and PLT length had the strongest Pearson's r value when correlated with load at failure (r?=?0.73, 0.81, respectively). CONCLUSION: Dog weight and PLT length were the best predictors of load at failure. PLT failure load of dogs weighing >25?kg were similar to those reported for the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) suggesting that the PLT may be a suitable allograft for CCL replacement.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1111/j.1532-950X.2013.12109.x,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this controlled clinical trial, 375 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction arthroscopically using hamstring tendons in the orthopedic clinics of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2010 and 2011 were selected. Fifteen patients were included because their hamstring tendon diameter was lower than 8 mm and peroneus longus was added. After 6 months, the patients were followed using ""Kistler force plate"" to detect 3D kinematics and kinetics of the ankles and spatiotemporal walking parameters. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between both operated and non-operated ankles in flexion/extension range of motion (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the moments of both ankles in sagittal and coronal planes (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference between the moments of both ankles in the transverse plane (P = 0.006). There was a significant difference in the force of operated and non-operated ankles in all three planes (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the mean values of spatiotemporal gait parameters between operated and non-operated sides (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Removing the peroneus longus tendon has no effect on gait parameters and does not lead to instability of the ankle. So, it can be used as an autogenous graft in orthopedic surgeries.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.4103/2277-9175.132696,
137,PM-137,Karimi et al. (2013),2013,Gait analysis of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed subjects with a combined tendon obtained from hamstring and peroneus longus,"BACKGROUND: Stability of the knee joint is achieved by a complex process in which the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays an important role. The rupture of this ligament is quite frequent especially in athletic young subjects. Various methods have been used to reconstruct the ACL. One of the new methods is to use a graft combined from peroneus longus and hamstring. As there is no evidence regarding this method, it was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this method. METHOD: Two groups of normal and those with ACL injury, in whom their ACLs were reconstructed with the new method, participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking on level surface were evaluated by a motion analysis system (Qualysis) and a Kistler force plate. The difference between the parameters of operated and non-operated sides and also between patients and normal subjects was evaluated by use of a two sample t test (p-value was 0.05). RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the pattern and magnitude of the loads transmitted by lower extrimity joints differed between normal and ACL reconstructed subjects. The sound side pattern and magnitude of motion were also influenced by ACL insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study showed that the reconstructed ACL by use of this method did not have enough performance to restore the function of the leg. As the knee joint is unstable following the use of this method, it is recommended to find a new method of ACL reconstruction to improve the function of this ligament after reconstruction.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.knee.2013.07.007,

METHODS: From January 2006 to December 2009, 35 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries were recruited to undergo surgical procedures. There were 30 males and 5 females with an average age of 31.8 years (range: 21 - 56). All anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions underwent arthroscopy. All ligaments were reconstructed with peroneus longus tendon and fixed with absorb screw. The post-operative assessments included the followings:clinical evaluations, Lysholm knee score, KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale AOFAS). RESULTS: All cases were followed up for an average follow-up period of 15 months (range: 12 - 24). The healing time was 6 - 15 weeks.according to the Lysholm knee score, their outcomes were excellent (n = 25), good (n = 6), fair (n = 3) and poor (n = 1). The average score was 97.2 (range: 60 - 100). The rate of excellent and good was 88.6%; according to the KT-3000 arthrometer evaluations, the outcomes were normal (n = 28), nearly normal (n = 4), abnormal (n = 2) and poor (n = 1). Preoperatively, the average anterior displacement was 11.59 ñ 1.25 mm and the average anterior displacement at final follow-up 1.76 ñ 1.83 mm. The average AOFAS score was 96.3 (range: 84 - 100). Lysholm knee score and KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation had statistical differences (P < 0.05) while AOFAS score showed no difference (P > 0.05).

(2010),2010,"A biomechanical comparison of fan-folded, single-looped fascia lata with other graft tissues as a suitable substitute for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initial biomechanical properties of a fan-folded, single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft in comparison to other graft tissues currently being used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS: Eighteen fascia lata specimens were harvested from 11 donors and fan folded through a proprietary process. Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus tendons were harvested from 4 additional donors. All soft-tissue grafts were tested to failure in an MTS machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) in a single-looped fashion. BPTB grafts were similarly clamped in freeze grips. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness were calculated for each graft type tested. RESULTS: The mean ultimate load to failure was 3,266 N and stiffness was 414 N/mm for the single-looped fascia lata grafts (n = 18). There was no significant difference for ultimate load to failure and stiffness between the fascia lata and tibialis anterior (3,012 N and 342 N/mm, respectively), tibialis posterior (3,666 N and 392 N/mm, respectively), and peroneus longus (3,050 N and 346 N/mm, respectively) tendons. The fascia lata grafts performed significantly better (P < .001) than BPTB (1,404 N and 224 N/mm, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft has, on biomechanical testing, initial ultimate tensile strength (3,266 N) and stiffness values equivalent to or better than several other graft tissues currently used in ACL reconstruction, including BPTB (1,403 N), tibialis anterior (3,012 N), tibialis posterior (3,666 N), and peroneus longus (3,050 N). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the face of potential allograft tissue shortages and increasing constraints on health care expenditures, the use of fascia lata has the potential to be a readily available graft for ACL reconstruction that performs as well as other grafts and at a comparable or lower cost.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.arthro.2010.03.019,

METHODS: ACL reconstructions with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone were performed in 18 patients (18 knees)in the study from March 2007 to July 2009. Among the patients,14 patients were male and 4 patients were female, ranging in age from 21 to 47 years, with an average of 35.5 years. Twelve patients had the injuries in the right knee and 6 patients in the left knee. The CT scans were taken in a consistent manner at the 1st week and the 3rd, 6th, 12th months after surgery to measure tibial and femoral tunnel expansion. RESULTS: Tunnel enlargement didn't happen in 18 knees. The average enlargement of 18 cases of femoral tunnel was (1.10 +/- 0.42) mm; and the average enlargement of 18 cases of tibial tunnel was (1.00 +/- 0.51) mm. There was statistical significance of femoral tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); and there were no significant difference of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and the 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05). There was statistical significance of tibial tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); there were no significant differences of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone could obviously reduce the incidence of tunnel enlargement. The tunnel diameter obviously increase in 3 months after surgery,and it remains basically unchanged later.",PubMed/MEDLINE,,

(2009),2009,Magnetic resonance imagination of the peroneus longus tendon after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Several studies report that tendons can regenerate after harvesting. These studies have been performed especially in patellar and hamstring tendons. At our institution, 10 cm length of full thickness peroneus longus tendon has been harvested to reconstruct torn anterior cruciate ligament since 1997 as a different graft source. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the peroneus longus tendon used the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has a regeneration potential or not. Twelve patients, who had originally undergone harvesting of the peroneus longus tendon for the primary surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Images of both legs were acquired simultaneously with the use of the scanner's extremity coil, as we aimed to compare harvested peroneus longus tendon with the other leg's peroneus longus tendon (healthy side) for evaluation of the regeneration potential. The average age of the patients was 31 years. There were eight right and four left legs. The average time interval was 52 months between ligament surgery and MRI. In all patients, a varying amount of the regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon was seen on the MRI images. Although the extent of PLT regeneration in proximal sections seemed better than in mid- and distal sections, there was no statistical difference between sections (P = 0.130).

METHODS: The study included 29 patients (27 males, 2 females; mean age 30 years; range 21 to 39 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft and interference nail fixation. Fourteen patients (48.3%) also had partial meniscectomy during surgery. The results were assessed according to the Lysholm scores and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale at the end of at least five years of follow-up. RESULTS: According to the IKDC scale, 17 patients (58.6%) were rated as normal or nearly normal, and 12 patients (41.4%) were rated as abnormal or severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm score was 83.7 (range 45 to 100), with excellent or good results in 23 patients (79.3%). Radiographic examination showed mild (n=10) or moderate (n=1) degenerative changes in the knee joint. Compared with the normal side, no flexion or extension losses occurred in the affected knees. Stability of the ACL was assessed by the Lachman test, which showed normal findings in 12 patients (41.4%), while nine patients had 1+, five patients had 2+, and three patients had 3+ anteroposterior laxity. Pivot-shift test was negative in 13 patients (44.8%); ten patients had 1+ pivot glide, and six patients had 2+ pivot shift. Two patients (6.9%) complained of mild to moderate pressure pain, paresthesia and dysesthesia at the donor site of PLT. No patient experienced ankle joint dysfunction or difficulty in sports activities due to PLT graft transfer.

These are the doubled tibialis anterior (TA), doubled tibialis posterior (TP), and doubled peroneus longus (PL) tendons. TYPE OF STUDY: A biomechanical evaluation of the properties of the TA, TP, and PL. METHODS: Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were used for testing. All specimens had the TA, TP, and PL tendons harvested. All specimens were tested in a custom-designed hydraulic testing machine using dry ice clamps. Each tendon was elongated at a rate of 1 mm/s. Load and displacement were recorded with an analog to digital interface board. Stiffness, modulus of elasticity, and stress and strain at failure were calculated. RESULTS: The average tested lengths of the TA, TP, and PL were 37 cm (range, 13-68 cm), 33 cm (range, 7-74 cm), and 42 cm (range, 17-69 cm), respectively. The average cross-sectional areas of the doubled TA, TP, and PL were 38 mm2, 48 mm2, and 37 mm2, respectively. The average failure loads for the doubled TA, TP, and PL tendons were 3,412 N, 3,391 N, and 2,483 N, respectively. The maximum stresses of the 3 tendons did not differ significantly (85-108 Mpa). The TA had the greatest stiffness (344 N/mm), followed by the TP (302 N/mm) and the PL (244 N/mm). Previous authors have documented the biomechanical strength of grafts for ACL reconstruction between 1,700 and 2,900 Newtons. The ultimate tensile strength and stiffness reported for the TA and TP grafts exceeded that for all previously reported grafts, including the doubled semitendinosus-gracilis. CONCLUSIONS: The TA, TP, and PL tendons showed excellent biomechanical properties when compared with historical data evaluating other graft sources. The biomechanical properties observed for the TA, TP, and PL were noted in specimens despite an average age of 78.3 years.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1016/j.arthro.2003.10.015,

The specimens were procured at the time of second-look arthroscopy from the superficial region of the midzone of the anterior cruciate ligament grafts after synovial clearage. The grafts used for the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were from fresh-frozen allogenic Achilles, tibialis anterior or posterior, or peroneus longus or brevis tendons and had been implanted 3 to 96 months previously. By 12 months after surgery, the anterior cruciate ligament allografts consisted predominantly of small-diameter collagen fibrils (30 to 80 nm), which resulted in a unimodal pattern in the collagen fibril profile. The number of large-diameter fibrils (90 to 140 nm) within the allogenic tendon grafts had decreased. This predominance of small-diameter collagen fibrils persisted in almost all specimens older than 12 months. The anterior cruciate ligament allografts had collagen fibril profiles that did not resemble normal tendon grafts or normal anterior cruciate ligaments, even several years after surgery.",PubMed/MEDLINE,10.1177/036354659502300213,
145,EM-1,Butt et al. (2025),2025,5-years outcomes following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction comparing quadruple hamstring and peroneus longus tendon autografts: a randomized control trial,"Aims: This study presents clinical outcomes, functional results, and return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using quadruple hamstring tendon autograft or peroneus longus tendon autograft in a randomized controlled trial. Patients and methods: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 ñ 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 ñ 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 ñ 3.9 (range = 85?100). Conclusion: Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.

146,EM-2,Jabeen et al. (2025),2025,Peroneus longus a surgical ally: bilateral and sex based morphometric cadaveric study of its muscle and tendon,"The Peroneus longus muscle plays an important role in ankle stability and is increasingly utilized as a tendon graft in reconstructive surgeries, including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and ankle stabilization surgeries. Despite its clinical significance, morphometric data comparing right and left limbs and sex-based variations remain limited. This study aims to evaluate the morphometry of the Peroneus longus muscle and tendon in cadavers and its relationship with anthropometric parameters. Methods: A total of 38 independent human cadaveric lower limbs (22 Male, 16 Female; 18 Right, 20 left) were dissected. Measurements recorded included length of lower limb, length of thigh, length of leg, total muscle length, tendon length, and tendon width. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Comparisons were made between sexes and sides using independent sample t-tests. Correlations with anthropometric measures were assessed using Pearson?s correlation and linear regression where the regression models were adjusted for gender and side. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The mean length of the Peroneus longus muscle was 36.44 ñ 2.66 cm, tendon length was 9.83 ñ 2.48 cm, and tendon width was 6.19 ñ 0.87 mm. Male cadavers demonstrated significantly greater tendon width compared to female cadavers (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found between right and left limbs for most parameters, although minor asymmetry was observed in tendon length. The Peroneus longus muscle was significantly longer in males than females (p < 0.05). No significant side-to-side differences were observed. Multivariable regression analyses were performed with adjustment for sex and side. Peroneus longus muscle length showed a strong positive relationship with leg length (? = 0.670, 95% CI: 0.341?0.998, p < 0.001) and thigh length (? = 0.382, 95% CI: 0.054?0.710, p = 0.024) when examined separately. In the mutually adjusted model, leg length remained the only significant predictor of Peroneus Longus muscle length (? = 0.563, 95% CI: 0.138?0.988, p = 0.011).For tendon outcomes, thigh length was positively associated with Peroneus Longus tendon thickness, both in univariable analysis (? = 0.133, 95% CI: 0.017?0.248, p = 0.026) and in the multivariable model. Conclusion: This study provides baseline morphometric data for the Peroneus longus muscle and its tendon, highlighting sexual dimorphism and anthropometric predictors of its morphometry, reinforcing its reliability as a tendon graft. Leg length predicts muscle length, while thigh length predicts tendon thickness, providing clinically useful preoperative markers.",Embase,10.69605/ijlbpr_14.10.2025.26,

(2025),2025,Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields good functional outcome of the ankle: A systematic review and meta-Analysis,"PURPOSE: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as a promising autograft option for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, but concerns persist regarding donor-site morbidity and ankle functional outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate ankle performance following PLT harvest for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis performed by searching five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) up to March 2025. Inclusion criteria included: ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft, ò6-month follow-up, and validated ankle outcomes (American Orthopaedic Foot And Ankle Society [AOFAS]/Foot and Ankle Disability Index [FADI] scores). Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models using R software (version 4.4.3). Heterogeneity was assessed via Iý statistics, and risk of bias was evaluated using JBI checklists. RESULTS: Twenty articles (1024 patients) were identified, comprising eleven prospective cohort studies and nine randomised clinical trials (RCT), based on title, abstract, and quality assessments. Meta-analysis demonstrated excellent postoperative ankle function, with pooled AOFAS scores of 96.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.6-99.3) at 6 months, 96.1 (93.9-98.2) at 12 months, and 97.2 (93.9-100.6) at 24 months. FADI scores similarly improved to 97.4 (96.0-98.9) by 6 months and 99.4 (98.7-100.1) at 24 months. Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age and AOFAS outcomes (? = -0.23, p = 0.36). Minor complications (e.g., transient hypaesthesia) occurred in 13%-23% of patients but resolved within months. No studies reported major nerve injuries or ankle instability. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields minimal donor-site morbidity, with consistently high AOFAS/FADI scores across all age groups. These findings support the safety of PLT autografts, though heterogeneity is evident, and the predominance of male participants and the regional focus of studies, mainly Asian populations, may affect generalisability.Level II.",Embase,10.1002/ksa.70079,
148,EM-4,Karapinar et al. (2025),2025,An Evaluation of the Effect on Ankle Stability of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft Used in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Background: Previous studies have focused on the effect of the peroneus longus tendon graft on the knee; in this study, we focused on its impact on the ankle. Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are frequently observed in sports injuries. The peroneus longus tendon graft has rapidly gained a place in the literature; however, very few studies have been conducted on the foot-ankle region stability of this tendon. Purpose: To investigate the effect on this region of the peroneus longus tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Study Design: Case series, Level of evidence 4. Methods: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023. The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded. Results: The dynamometer measurements of the donor side and the contralateral side were compared. No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the ankle eversion and plantar flexion strength measurements (P = .096, P = .835, respectively). A significant result was obtained in the flamingo test (P = .049). No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the anterior, posterior, and lateral distances of the Y test (78.8 vs 78.6 cm, P = .973; 96.6 vs 80.4 cm, P = .053; 89.5 vs 95.0 cm, P = .357, respectively). In the examination of ankle functionality, no statistically significant difference was determined in the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score of the 2 sides (P = .798, P = .206, respectively). Conclusion: The peroneus longus tendon can be safely used as an alternative autograft in ACLR without causing donor site morbidity. There may be a deficit in balance test performance.",Embase,10.1177/23259671251371229,
149,EM-5,Kumar et al.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendon (HT) autografts for primary ACLR. Hypothesis: There would be no significant difference in patient outcomes between PLT and HT autografts in ACLR. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a thorough literature search was conducted on February 10, 2024, across the PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus databases. The aim was to identify comparative studies investigating the effectiveness of PLT and HT autografts for primary ACLR. The initial literature search retrieved 96 studies. Ten studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Data analysis was performed using RevMan Version 5.4.1. Functional scores, graft characteristics, donor site morbidity, and failure rates were compared. Results: Ten studies involving 949 patients were included. Both the PLT and HT groups showed comparable functional outcomes, knee stability, and graft failure rates. PLT autografts demonstrated a larger mean graft diameter (8.63 mm vs 8.08 mm) and lower incidence of donor site morbidity (7.48% vs 22.01%) than HT autografts. There was a statistically significant mean difference (MD) favoring PLT autografts in the modified Cincinnati score (MD, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.84 to 4.81; P < .0001) and thigh circumference (MD, ?7.62 mm; 95% CI, ?8.90 to ?6.33; P < .00001). Conclusion: This review showed that both PLT and HT autografts are effective options for primary ACLR, with similar functional outcomes and knee stability. PLT autografts offer advantages in terms of graft diameter and donor site morbidity. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and guide clinical decision-making in ACLR practice.",Embase,10.1177/23259671251374313,
150,EM-6,Lu et al. (2025),2025,Comparative study of three-in-one procedure versus combined anterior cruciate ligament and anterolateral structure reconstruction for revision of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Objective To compare the clinical efficacy of three-in-one procedure versus combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and anterolateral structure (ALS) reconstruction in patients with ACL reconstruction failure. Methods A total of 32 patients who underwent revision ACL reconstruction from January 2020 to March 2023 were included. The ipsilateral semitendinosus tendon, gracilis tendons, and the anterior half of the ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon, were harvested to constitute the autograft. In patients in whom the ipsilateral semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were unavailable, the bilateral anterior halves of the peroneus longus tendons were utilised. The ACL+ALS group, with bigger transplant graft (diameter >8 mm, n=17; males 13, females 4; mean age 28.29ñ7.90 years), ACL combined with ALS reconstruction were performed. The three-in-one group (n=15; males 8, females 7; mean age 29.53ñ6.73 years) underwent additional iliotibial band (ITB) transposition for grafts with diameter <8 mm (excluding ITB). Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and graft dimensions were compared. Graft healing was evaluated via postoperative MRI. Knee stability was evaluated via the Lachman test. Lysholm knee score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and Tegner activity scale were compared preoperatively, 6-months postoperatively, and 12-months postoperatively, to assess knee function recovery. Results Surgical parameters revealed that the ACL+ALS group had an operative time of 47.82ñ9.32 min, blood loss of 29.00ñ6.99 ml, graft diameter of 8.77ñ0.69 mm; three-in-one group had an operative time of 57.47ñ10.06 min, blood loss of 36.33ñ6.99 ml, graft diameter of 8.53ñ0.52 mm. Although graft diameter showed no significant intergroup difference (t=1.065, P>0.05), the three-in-one group showed significantly longer operative times and greater blood loss (t=2.815, P=0.009; t=2.746, P=0.010). The average follow-up time of the ACL+ALS group was 19.47ñ5.25 months (range, 12-28 months), whereas the three-in-one group was 20.40ñ6.50 months (range, 12-32 months). Postoperative MRI showed continuous and homogeneous graft signals in both groups at 6 and 12 months. Lachman test showed negative in 15 cases, grade I in 2 cases in the ACL+ALS group; and negative in 14 cases, grade I in 1 case in the three-in-one group. Both groups exhibited significant improvement from preoperative status (P<0.001), with no intergroup difference (P=1.000). Functional scores revealed that both groups showed significant improvement in Lysholm, IKDC, and Tegner scores at 6 and 12 months (P<0.05 vs. preoperative), with no intergroup differences (P>0.05). In KOOS subscales, the three-in-one group had significantly lower scores than the ACL+ALS group in pain (88.89ñ5.75 vs. 94.77ñ3.79 at 6 months; 89.26ñ5.93 vs. 96.41ñ3.22 at 12 months) and sports/recreation (71.33ñ12.32 vs. 83.53ñ9.31 at 6 months; 73.67ñ13.43 vs. 88.24ñ8.65 at 12 months; P<0.05). Conclusions When the graft diameter is greater than or equal to 8 mm, both the three-in-one procedure and ACL combined with ALS reconstruction are effective for revision ACL reconstruction. However, patients who underwent three-in-one procedure experienced higher postoperative pain levels.",Embase,10.3760/cma.j.cn121113-20250103-00010,

152,EM-8,Calvo et al. (2025),2025,Effect of diameter reduction by compression on peroneus longus allograft integrity: A biomechanical analysis,"Background: There is broad consensus regarding the minimum required graft diameter in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery; a diameter of at least 8 mm is recommended when using hamstring tendon grafts. However, it remains unclear what happens when a larger-diameter graft is compressed to a smaller diameter, and how this alteration may affect the biomechanical properties of the graft. The objectives is determine whether the biomechanical strength of compressed allografts is preserved after reducing their diameter, and whether compression techniques could be considered a viable option for smaller patients such as women and children. Our hypothesis is that a compressed graft may retain similar strength to the original, despite having a reduced diameter. Methods: This was a cadaveric biomechanical case-control study using 30 peroneus longus (PL) tendon allografts. The grafts were divided into three groups: Group 0 (8 mm uncompressed grafts), Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts), and Group 2 (10 mm with a graft tube, compression to 9 mm). Each graft was tested using a Zwick/Roell Z005 tensile testing machine, undergoing cyclic loading between 50 and 250 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles, followed by continuous tensile loading to failure. The maximum failure force (Fmax) was recorded for each graft. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.18.5. Results: Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts) showed a mean maximum failure force of 1902 N (SD: 432.12; 95 % CI). Group 2 (compressed grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1608 N (SD: 233.12; 95 % CI), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.037). Group 0 (native 8 mm grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1341 N (SD: 936.67; 95 % CI). No statistically significant difference was found between Group 0 and Group 2 (p = 0.196). Conclusions: The results indicate that the compressed group had lower resistance compared to the original 9 mm grafts. However, when compared to the smaller-diameter grafts, no significant difference in strength was observed. Nonetheless, the compressed grafts showed a tendency to withstand higher loads than the native 8 mm grafts.",Embase,10.1016/j.jor.2025.06.036,
153,EM-9,Savery & Shankarlal (2025),2025,Functional Outcomes In Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft- Most Promising Autograft,"Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament is a ligament structure comprising dense connective tissue mainly composed of parallel rows of fibroblasts and type 1 collagen it functions not like a simple tube of fibres at constant tension but as several groups of fibres undergoing successive stretching and relaxation during flexion extension for this reason. It is functionally and anatomically subdivided into anteromedial and posterolateral bundles. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common sports injuries and one of the most commonly treated conditions of the knee in the young. Sports such as soccer account for most of these injuries in the world. Although ACL injuries are common, there is still considerable variation in their management. If left untreated, this may lead to functional instability, secondary osteoarthritis, and increased risk of further meniscal of same knee joint injuries. Aim: To Study Functional Outcome Of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft At Tertiary Care Centre. Material and methods: The study was a prospective study conducted on a minimum of 34 patients in each group enlisting in the casualty or inpatient department of orthopaedics at Sri Lakshmi Narayana Institute of Medical Sciences medical college and tertiary health care centre. Only those patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. All the patients was explained about the surgical procedure, the purpose of the study and Informed consent was taken. Patients was evaluated on the basis of history, clinical examination and follow up for wound check, suture removal on 2nd week and range of motion and radiological work up on 3,6,9 month follow up. Functional outcome for Knee: 1) Tegner-Lysholm scoring system, 2) IKDC subjective assessment score. Functional outcome for ankle: 1) AOFAS score. Results: Mean age was 24.2+1.3years. Majority 65% were males. Common mode of injury was sports 58%, followed by motor bike accident 27%. Present study concludes that Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Peronius Longus Tendon Graft had an excellent functional Outcome. The morbidity was very less. Post operative thigh circumference difference as well as inversion and eversion of ankle was also negligible.

The study further evaluates the viability of the PLT autograft as a non-inferior alternative to the conventional HT autograft. METHOD: We independently searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science for all relevant articles from inception to March 2025, in only the English language. Clinical outcomes included: IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, Tegner-Lysholm score, Visual-Analog-Scale (VAS) score, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, Modified Cincinnati score, graft diameter, thigh circumference, graft harvest time, Knee laxity & stability (Lachman test, Pivot Shift test, and Anterior Drawer test), and Donor-site morbidity. Funnel plots were used to detect publication bias. All statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.1.3). RESULTS: A total of 25 studies, 9 RCTs, and 16 cohort studies containing 1944 patients were included in this analysis. No statistically significant differences were observed between PLT and HT autografts in functional outcomes, including Tegner scores, Lysholm scores, Tegner-Lysholm scores, VAS scores, or objective measures of knee stability and laxity across all follow-up periods. Notably, the PLT group demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the HT group, including significantly larger graft diameter, reduced graft harvesting time, improved Modified Cincinnati Scores at both 12- and 24-month follow-ups, and lower donor-site morbidity rates. Despite significantly higher IKDC scores in the PLT group at 6 months postoperatively, no significant differences were observed at 12-, and 18, 24, or 36-month follow-up. Conversely, PLT groups had slightly lower AOFAS scores at 12 or 24 months follow-up than the HT group. CONCLUSION: The PLT autograft demonstrates comparable clinical outcomes to HT autograft in ACL reconstruction while offering distinct advantages, including significantly larger graft diameter, reduced harvest time, and lower donor-site morbidity. These benefits, coupled with equivalent postoperative functional results, position the PLT autograft as a promising alternative to traditional HT autograft. Long-term follow-up and higher-quality studies are needed to support our results and further investigate the differences between PLT autograft and HT autograft.

We investigated the clinical outcomes of using a peroneus longus (PL) graft for revision ACL surgery combined with a lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedure. Materials and Methods: Institutional ethics approval was obtained before the initiation of the study. Thirty consecutive patients were prospectively recruited with clinical and radiological evidence of ACL reconstruction failure and followed up for a one-year duration. Knee outcomes (Visual Analog Scale [VAS], International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm) scores, return to sport rates, ankle outcome measures (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle score and functional ankle disability index), and complications were assessed. Results: All thirty patients were males with an average age of 28.9 ñ 4.4 years. One third of the study population comprised athletes. Excellent knee and ankle outcomes were observed, with significant improvement in VAS, IKDC, and Lysholm scores over the study duration. The re-rupture rate in the entire study population was 7%, with a return to sport rate of 93% and a return to sport at a pre-injury level of 73% at an average duration of 10.8 months post-surgery.

The purpose of our study is to evaluate how good an alternative peroneus longus tendon (PLT) can be when used as a graft in primary ACLR by comparing the functional outcomes of patients undergoing ACLR with PLT versus Hamstring tendon (HT). Materials and Methods: Quasi-experimental study involving 40 patients each in the PLT group and HT group was performed. The knee functional outcomes were compared using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Tegner Lysholm (TL) knee score measured preoperatively, at 3-, 6-, and 24-month post-surgery. Ankle site morbidity was measured by the foot and ankle disability index (FADI) score and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score. Results: IKDC score in PLT group and HT group was 59.3 ñ 16.08 and 48.25 ñ 15.81 preoperatively, and it improved to 97.5 ñ 2.58 and 92.8 ñ 5.12 at 24 months, respectively. The median TL scores were 68.5 (Interquartile range [IQR] 42.3-80) and 71.5 (IQR 62.3-77) and improved to 100 (IQR 96-100) and 100 (IQR 98-100) at 24 months in PLT and HT groups, respectively. FADI and AOSFA scores for the ankle were 100 preoperatively. They dropped to 98.05 ñ 1.96 and 98.05 ñ 2.24 at 3 months after PLT harvest. Both the scores improved to 100 by 6 months. Graft diameter averaged at 8.78 ñ 0.95 mm in the PLT group and 8.12 ñ 1.10 mm in the HT group. Conclusion: Harvesting PLT is relatively easier and faster, yielding sufficient-sized tendons consistently compared to HTs. Both performed similarly in regard to patient-reported outcome measures measured and followed over 2 years. No graft failures were there in both the groups. We conclude that PLTs perform similar to HT autografts when used for primary ACLR without any associated ankle site morbidity.",Embase,10.25259/JASSM_46_2024,

Of late, the use of Peroneus longus tendon has shown promising results. Indian population is predominantly kneeling population where squatting and sitting crossed are associated with daily living activities. This study involves the comparative analysis of the morbidities associated with both the grafts and the choice of autograft based on the Indian population needs. Methods: A Comparative cohort study was conducted on 60 patients who underwent ACL Reconstruction during 2022-2023.The patients were randomly assigned for either peroneus longus or hamstring autograft. After a follow-up of one year, the donor site morbidities were assessed using Lysholm score for knee and FADI (Foot and Ankle Disability Index) for ankle joint. Results: A significant statistical difference (p value = <0.001) was seen in the mean time required to harvest hamstring and peroneal grafts. After a mean follow up of 14.3 months (range 13-20 months), in patients with hamstring graft, the mean post operative Lysholm score was 89.6 ñ 4.37 and in patients where peroneal graft was used, the mean score was 90.7ñ 3.9. Although the scores were statistically insignificant (p = 0.03), 20% of patients with hamstring graft, recorded VAS pain score >7/10 while deep squatting and loading heavy weights compared to peroneal graft patients with 6.7%. FADI scores of the donor side (97.9 ñ 2.32) and contralateral side (99 ñ 2.32) in patients with peroneal graft showed statistically insignificant results (p value = 0.06). Conclusion: Owing to the graft diameter, robust quality, tensile strength and lesser knee joint morbidity, Peroneus longus can be considered as a better alternative autograft to the Indian population. However, in athletes, a careful decision should be made as further long-term studies are required to assess the ankle joint morbidity due to this autograft.",Embase,10.69605/ijlbpr_14.7.2025.154,

Methods: The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. Results: A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18?20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group. Conclusions: PL tendon autograft can be used as a safe and effective autograft choice for ACLR with excellent functional outcomes comparable to HST tendon autograft and minimal donor site morbidity.

(2025),2025,MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft satisfactorily restores knee stability with no impairment in foot function and with a low failure rate for concurrent ACL reconstruction,"PURPOSE: Addressing grade 2 and 3 medial-sided instabilities during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is crucial to reduce the risk of ACL graft failure. This study introduced a minimally invasive, medial collateral ligament (MCL) augmentation technique using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft, which was fixed to the femoral deep MCL insertion and tibial superficial MCL insertion. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal, single-centre case series included patients who underwent MCL augmentation concurrent with primary or revision ACL reconstruction due to anteromedial instability. Preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up, clinical examinations, such as rolimeter test of anterior tibial translation and medial instability, knee (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], Lsyholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and foot function scores (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score [AOFAS]) and complications, were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 13.5 ñ 2.6 months and a mean age of 27.8 ñ 9.6 years were included. The side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation significantly improved from preoperative to 1-year follow-up with an ACL reconstruction failure rate of 6.5%. No patient retained a grade 2 or 3 medial instability on valgus stress testing with 30ø flexion. Significant improvements from preoperative to 1-year postoperative follow-up were observed in knee function scores: IKDC (48.9 ñ 26.9- 71.3 ñ 11.5, p < 0.001) and Lysholm (59.9 ñ 28.5-80.5 ñ 11.2, p = 0.002) as well as KOOS pain, ADL, sport and QoL, each reaching the respective minimal clinically important difference values. The foot function score AOFAS showed no significant impairment (100 ñ 0-99.3 ñ 2.5, p = 0.250). Complications included cyclops lesions of ACL reconstruction in three patients. CONCLUSION: At 1-year follow-up, MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft for patients simultaneously undergoing ACL reconstruction satisfactorily restores knee stability, has a low ACL reconstruction failure rate and does not significantly impair foot function.

Summary: PL also provides longer harvested tendon length, thicker graft diameter, a longer graft and better functional outcomes after preparation for AI-ACLR, as compared to ST. Data: Introduction: The AI-ACLR has been studied by many authors using various graft options e.g. STG, ST, allograft, synthetic graft etc. Peroneus longus has not been assessed till now in AI-ACLR. We designed this study to assess the feasibility of PL tendon in AI- ACLR, compare various intraoperative and postoperative parameters with AI-ACLR done using ST graft. We have also described our modified technique of graft preparation which is more reproducible and does not require to adjust the tibial tunnel drilling depth. Material and methods: The study was conducted from January 2021 to December 2022. It was a prospective case control study with patients followed up for minimum 18 months. Patients having clinically and MRI proven ACL tears, aged between 18 to 50 years were included in the study. Patients having multiligament injuries, any fracture, meniscal injuries, pre-existing osteoarthritis of knee or BMI 30 kg/m2 were excluded from study. 57 patients were enrolled for the study. Patients were non-randomly divided into two groups according to the graft source. Group 1: operated with peroneus longus (PL) tendon graft; Group 2: operated using the semitendinosus (ST) tendon graft. All patients underwent AI-ACLR using our modified technique. 46 patients completed the followup and were included in final analysis (Group 1, n= 35; Group 2, n= 11). Results: Mean Age was 28 (17 - 36) years. Preoperative clinical examination was done in all the patients. Lachmann test was positive grade 2 in 10 (21.7%) patients and grade 3 in 36 (78.3%) patients. Anterior drawer was positive grade 2 in 14 (30.4%) patients and grade 3 in 32 (69.6%) patients. Pivot shift was grade 2 positive in 15 (32.6 %) patients and grade 3 in 31 (67.4 %) patients. The average time since injury till the surgery was 9.26 15.83 months (range 1?70 months). The mean graft length was 69.37 1.91 mm (65-75 mm). Mean surgical time was 60.3 8.75 minutes (range 47 ? 75 minutes). Average followup duration was 24 4.8 months (range 18-29). The harvested tendon length was significantly longer in Group 1 (31.51 ñ 2.41mm vs 29.0 ñ 2.49mm) (P=0.005). Group 1 also had significantly thicker graft diameter (P=0.021) (8.87ñ1.16mm vs 8.09 ñ 0.30mm), better followup KOOS score (P<0.001; 68.86 ñ 6.1 vs 60.09 ñ 5.65), Lysholm score (P=0.038; 69.46 ñ 4.62 vs 65.73 ñ 6.25) and IKDC score (P=0.045; 59.26 ñ 3.81 vs 56.18 ñ 5.65). The followup VAS score was better in Group 2 (1.34 ñ 0.54 vs 1.36 ñ 0.51) but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.910). The mean surgical time was slightly less in Group 1 (59.89 ñ 9.32min vs 61.64 ñ 6.82min) but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.506). Conclusion: Our modified technique of AI-ACLR using PL autograft provides significantly better functional scores with no loosening of graft and with no major complications, at minimum 18 months followup as compared to ST autograft. Use of PL also provides longer harvested tendon length, thicker graft diameter, a longer graft after preparation for AI-ACLR.",Embase,10.1016/j.jisako.2025.100495,

(2025),2025,A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF ARTHROSCOPIC PRIMARY ACL RECONSTRUCTION WITH IPSILATERAL PERONEUS LONGUS TENDON GRAFT,"Objective: To evaluate the functional viability of PLT for ACL reconstruction while assessing potential impacts on ankle function from the donor site. Methods: It was a prospective study which included 40 patients with ACL tears who presented to the outpatient department (OPD) and emergency department of Government Medical College, Patiala. All participants underwent ACL reconstruction surgery utilizing a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft via an arthroscopic single-bundle technique. Functional evaluation was done by International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. Results: The study involved 40 patients with ACL tears, predominantly young males (mean age 27.85ñ7.65 y), with 82.50% affected on the right side. The majority of injuries were due to roadside accidents (42.50%) and sports (37.50%). Significant differences in knee flexion were observed between affected (121.27ñ3.93ø) and unaffected sides (124.92ñ3.51ø, p<0.0001). Pre-operative VAS scores reflecting severe pain (7.02ñ0.92) decreased substantially post-operation to 1.90ñ0.90 (p<0.00001). Functional outcomes showed significant improvement over time, with no significant difference in ankle eversion between the sides (p = 0.34). Conclusion: The PLT emerges as a promising autograft option for ACL reconstruction, particularly in multi-ligament injuries and revision cases, delivering excellent clinical outcomes comparable to traditional grafts. The PLT graft effectively restores knee stability while preserving range of motion along with muscle strength in the ipsilateral ankle, highlighting its viability as a suitable alternative with minimal complications and donor site morbidity.",Embase,10.22159/ijcpr.2025v17i3.55049,
164,EM-20,Shevate et al. (2025),2025,Delayed Primary Repair of Patella Tendon Tear with Autologous Soft-tissue Graft Augmentation: A Report of Two Cases,"A patellar tendon rupture is an infrequent injury that results in the loss of active knee extension, leading to significant disability. Chronic patellar tendon ruptures are challenging to manage due to the proximal retraction of the patella, contracture, atrophy of the quadriceps muscle and scarring of the surrounding tissues. Delayed primary repair of patellar tendon tears with autologous soft-tissue graft augmentation is an effective surgical technique for restoring knee extensor function and structural integrity in cases where immediate repair is not feasible. This case report discusses two cases in which the patellar tendon tear was neglected, resulting in the loss of both extension and flexion of the knee, thus causing difficulties in daily living. The patients presented late to the orthopaedic Outpatient Department (OPD) with patellar tendon injuries, which were treated by delayed primary repair with soft-tissue autograft augmentation utilising semitendinosus grafts. This study highlights the fact that this approach provides strong tendon reinforcement, minimises the risk of re-rupture and promotes robust tendon healing by leveraging the biological benefits of autologous tissue.

(2025),2025,Comparative efficacy of different lengths of anterior cruciate ligament stump during reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury affects individuals, and successful ACL helps patients return to an active lifestyle. This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length ò 1/2 and < 1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump ò 1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump < 1/2) groups (n = 17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. RESULTS: In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p < 0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length ò 1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length < 1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint.",Embase,10.1186/s12893-025-02913-w,

(2025),2025,Harvesting the Full Thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Is Not Associated With Structural Foot Impairments: A 12- to 23-Year Follow-up Study,"Background: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft is suggested as a promising alternative graft option for reconstructive procedures supported by a growing body of evidence indicating favorable results. However, concerns remain regarding long-term functional impairments of the foot and ankle after harvesting a full-thickness PLT. Purpose: To evaluate long-term donor site morbidity in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a PLT autograft. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with harvested PLT autografts, and all eligible patients were invited to participate in a clinical examination at the hospital. To evaluate their range of motion, all included patients underwent a physical examination. Clinical outcomes were measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Activities of Daily Living and Sports subscales of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-ADL and FAAM-S). To evaluate foot and ankle structural changes, the intermetatarsal angle (IMA), hallux valgus angle (HVA), arc height index (AHI), lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (LTFMA), calcaneal pitch angle (CPA), and metatarsal angle (MA) were measured in the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side. Results: A total of 26 patients who were available for the final follow-up were included in this study. The mean age of the patients at the final follow-up was 45.7 ñ 9.5 years. The mean follow-up time was 19.5 ñ 3.4 years. AOFAS scores were excellent in 92.3% of patients (n = 24) and good in 7.7% (n = 2). The mean FAAM-ADL score was 99.6 ñ 1.86. The mean FAAM-S score was 98.1 ñ 5.94. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side for any of the measured parameters?including the IMA, HVA, AHI, LTFMA, CPA, and MA. Conclusion: This study demonstrated good to excellent long-term patient-reported outcomes and negligible radiographic changes after harvesting the full thickness PLT compared with the contralateral side. These long-term data strongly support PLT harvesting as an alternative graft choice and suggest that this method does not alter the natural history of foot and ankle structures.",Embase,10.1177/23259671251320659,
167,EM-23,da et al. (2025),2025,Inframalleolar harvest of the peroneus longus tendon graft: Surgical technique,"Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft has recently gained visibility in the literature as a promising option for knee ligament reconstructions. The most used harvesting technique is performed with a single incision posterior to the lateral malleolus, with large series reporting tendon lengths enough to prepare a double or triple anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, resulting in mean diameters greater than 8.0 mm. However, as happens with the hamstrings, some patients may present PLT grafts with a 7-mm diameter, which is associated with higher failure rates and is the minimum acceptable diameter for ACL reconstructions. In turn, the 2-incision technique has longer graft lengths reported, enough to prepare 4-folded grafts, with mean diameters above 9.0 mm, ranging from 8.5 to 10 mm. Once the PLT graft diameter has a direct correlation with anthropometric measurements, as well as larger ACL graft diameters are associated with lower failure rates and revision surgeries, the inframalleolar harvesting seems to be a reasonable option, especially for short-stature patients with a greater risk of insufficient grafts. Additionally, patients who benefit from an extra-articular procedure can have a combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament using the PLT graft with the two-incision technique, with no need for another graft. Therefore, this article aims to describe the step-by-step technique for the inframalleolar PLT harvesting.",Embase,10.1016/j.jisako.2025.100384,

(2025),2025,"Management of a complex multiligament knee injury: Simultaneous reconstruction of ACL, PCL, and both meniscal roots","Introduction: Multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs) can lead to severe complications like early osteoarthritis and functional loss. Meniscal root tears further increase these risks. This study reports the first documented case of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and dual meniscal root injuries, emphasizing the unique surgical and rehabilitative challenges involved. Presentation of case: A 19-year-old male presented with persistent knee pain and instability seven months after a traumatic injury from a major fall. Examination revealed a range of motion of 0?120 degrees, no swelling or tenderness, but a positive recurvatum over 10 degrees, indicating significant instability. Lachman's, McMurray's, pivot shift, and both anterior and posterior drawer tests were positive. Discussion: The radiography of the right knee revealed no fractures. The MRI confirmed injuries to the ACL, PCL, and the posterior roots of both the lateral and medial menisci. The patient received surgical intervention. Grafts were obtained: the peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and a hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The ACL and PCL reconstructions were subsequently performed utilizing an all-inside technique, and both posterior roots of the lateral and medial menisci were repaired. Postoperative care included knee immobilization and a progressive rehabilitation program. Conclusion: Effective management of multiple ligament knee injuries necessitates a comprehensive approach, including precise identification and treatment of all torn ligaments, accurate graft placement, and robust fixation. Simultaneous reconstruction reduces hospital stays, anaesthesia exposure, and surgical risks while streamlining rehabilitation, enabling quicker patient recovery and improved outcomes.",Embase,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111150,

Early identification of HBV-LC risk is essential for timely intervention. This study develops and compares nine machine learning (ML) models to predict HBV-LC risk in CHB patients using routine clinical and laboratory data. A retrospective analysis was conducted involving 777 CHB patients, with 50.45% (392/777) progressing to HBV-LC. Admission data consisted of 52 clinical and laboratory variables, with missing values addressed using multiple imputation. Feature selection utilized Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm, identifying 24 key variables. The evaluated ML models included XGBoost, logistic regression (LR), LightGBM, random forest (RF), AdaBoost, Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The data set was partitioned into an 80% training set (n = 621) and a 20% independent testing set (n = 156). Cross-validation (CV) facilitated hyperparameter tuning and internal validation of the optimal model. Performance metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Brier score, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The RF model demonstrated superior performance, with AUCs of 0.992 (training) and 0.907 (validation), while the reconstructed model achieved AUCs of 0.944 (training) and 0.945 (validation), maintaining an AUC of 0.863 in the testing set. Calibration curves confirmed a strong alignment between observed and predicted probabilities. Decision curve analysis indicated that the RF model provided the highest net benefit across threshold probabilities. The SHAP algorithm identified RPR, PLT, HBV DNA, ALT, and TBA as critical predictors.

The peroneus longus tendon has newly increased consideration as a possible autograft for ACL rebuilding due to its asset and minimal donor-site injury. However, incomplete studies have measured its long-term functional consequences. This study proposes to assess the functional consequences of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus autograft by assessing knee stability, mobility, and patient satisfaction. Methods: A prospective observational study was directed at 35 patients who experienced ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft.

Methods: In a single-center retrospective observational study, the effects of different postinterventional protamine doses on the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, platelet count (PLT), and hemoglobin (Hb) were analyzed in consecutive patients who underwent high-dose heparin administration (>300 U/kg body weight) and extracorporeal circulation for chemosaturation treatment. Due to the multiple treatments of individual patients, linear mixed-effects models were applied. Results: Thirty-one patients underwent 90 chemosaturation interventions, 68 (75.6%) of which involved heparin reversal with protamine. All investigated variables showed significant postinterventional alterations, while protamine use was associated with significantly lower aPTT, lower INR, higher PT, and higher fibrinogen levels, whereas PLT and Hb levels were comparable to those in procedures without protamine use. After adjustment for aPTT, significant independent effects of protamine remained for the INR and PT. Dose-dependent effects of protamine were observed for reductions in aPTT and an increase in fibrinogen levels, which were confirmed after adjustment for the heparin dose. A 10% higher protamine dose resulted in a 3% decrease in aPTT and a 4% increase in fibrinogen. An increase of 0.1 in the protamine-to-heparin ratio was associated with an increase of 9% in fibrinogen. Conclusions: The present results suggest that protamine contributes to the normalization of the aPTT, INR, PT, and fibrinogen levels. Further prospective studies should be conducted to determine optimal dosing ratios.",Embase,10.3390/clinpract15020038,

(2025),2025,Surgical Technique of Single-Graft Double-Bundle Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Peroneus Longus Tendon,"The posterior cruciate ligament is the primary posterior stabilizer of the knee. Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) has been demonstrated to improve outcomes and stability of the knee compared with conservative management. Numerous techniques are available to the treating surgeon, such as the double-bundle PCLR technique, which has biomechanical superiority over single-bundle PCLR. Residual knee laxity is decreased, native knee kinematics are better replicated, and improved subjective and objective outcomes have been reported with anatomic double-bundle PCLR. The potential disadvantages of allografts and the use of multiple grafts have created the need for the use of a double-bundle PCLR with a single autograft. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) grafts are frequently used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and good results have been reported with their use in single-bundle PCLR. The advantages of the PLT graft include a long length, large cross-sectional area, and a simple harvesting technique.

The over-the-top (OTT) technique offers a single-stage solution by avoiding femoral tunnel drilling. However, its main limitation is the reduced graft diameter, typically between 5.5 and 7 mm, which may be insufficient in revision settings. This Technical Note describes an augmentation of the classic OTT technique using a peroneus longus tendon allograft wrapped around preserved-insertion hamstring tendons, achieving graft diameters exceeding 8 mm. Standard arthroscopic portals are used to prepare a standard tibial tunnel, whereas a lateral femoral approach is performed to prepare the OTT point. Femoral fixation is secured with staples, and a lateral extra-articular tenodesis is performed to enhance rotational stability.

Understanding the changes in the electromyographic activity of the lower extremity muscles in individuals with DKV helps trainers design ACL injury prevention exercises. Therefore, the present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the muscle activation of the lower limb muscles in individuals with DKV during single-leg and overhead squats. Methods: Articles with titles, abstracts, and full texts were searched and screened independently by two reviewers in the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases, without restrictions on publication date and in English using specified keywords from their inception to January 5, 2024. The quality of articles was evaluated using a modified version of the Downs and Black quality checklist. This meta-analysis used mean difference (MD) to compare the muscle activity patterns between individual with DKV and healthy individuals. Heterogeneity was detected using I-square (I2) test. Results: In total, four papers with 130 participants were included in the study. Evidence showed a significant difference between the DKV group and the healthy group regarding the activities of the adductor magnus (MD: 6.25, P < 0.001), vastus medialis (MD: 13.23, P = 0.002), vastus lateralis (MD: 11.71, P = 0.004), biceps femoris (MD: 3.06, P = 0.003), and tibialis anterior muscles (MD: 8.21, P = 0.02). Additionally, muscle activity in the DKV group was higher than that in the healthy group. Conclusions: This meta-analysis reveals distinct muscle activation patterns in individuals with dynamic knee valgus (DKV), with increased activity in key muscles suggesting compensatory responses. These findings underscore the need for targeted rehabilitation to address muscle imbalances and improve knee stability.",Embase,10.1186/s12891-024-07759-6,

(2024),2024,Novel modified implant fixation technique for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring and peroneus longus autografts in limited resource settings: a comparative study on knee stability,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing popularity of contact sports, the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries is rising. ACL reconstruction has been recognized as the most common procedure to restore knee stability. One of the main drawbacks of standard implant is that the medical costs incurred are often beyond the reach of most patients, so patients who need ACL reconstruction surgery must find other financially affordable alternatives. Due to the many knee joint complications involving patellar and hamstring tendon grafts in ACL reconstruction, the new proposed solution is anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This research was an analytical study with a cross-sectional observational design. The sample in this study compared patients diagnosed with ACL rupture who received ACL reconstruction treatment using a modified implant with a hamstring tendon autograft and a peroneus longus tendon autograft. The sample was examined using the consecutive sampling technique by tracing medical record data, used as secondary data, and through the distribution of the Lysholm Knee and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring questionnaires. RESULTS: Out of 69 samples that met the inclusion criteria, 45 were hamstring autograft samples, and 24 were peroneus autograft samples. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of Lysholm Knee Score (P=0.135), International Knee Documentation Committee Score (P=0.352), use of a mobile aider (P=0.488), power grading (P=0.905), and range of motion of the knee (P=0.110).

The present study was conducted for comparing the outcome of Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction by PLT vs Semitendinosus graft. Materials & methods:A cohort of 40 patients diagnosed with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, confirmed through both clinical assessment and radiographic imaging, underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Of these patients, 20 received semitendinosus grafts, while the remaining 20 were treated with peroneus longus tendon grafts. All surgical procedures were performed under spinal or epidural anesthesia, utilizing a tourniquet, and the postoperative recovery was without complications. A uniform rehabilitation protocol was implemented for all patients following the ACL reconstruction. Postoperative outcome was evaluated using Lysholm score. Results:Mean age of the patients of Semitendinosus grafts group and PLT group was 38.3 years and 40.7 years respectively. Mean postoperative Lysholm score among patients of the Semitendinosus grafts group and PLT group was 91.3 and 93.7 respectively. Excellent results were seen in 85 percent of the patients of the semitendinosus group and in 90 percent of the patients of the PLT group. non-significant results were obtained while comparing outcome among patients of both the study groups. Conclusion:The semitendinosus muscle contributes to knee internal rotation and flexion strength. PLT also has significant tensile strength and the potential for regeneration post-replacement.

186,EM-42,Xu et al. (2024),2024,Contribution of ankle motion pattern during landing to reduce the knee-related injury risk,"Background: Single-leg landing (SL) is an essential technique in sports such as basketball, soccer, and volleyball, which is often associated with a high risk of knee-related injury. The ankle motion pattern plays a crucial role in absorbing the load shocks during SL, but the effect on the knee joint is not yet clear. This work aims to explore the effects of different ankle plantarflexion angles during SL on the risk of knee-related injury. Methods: Thirty healthy male subjects were recruited to perform SL biomechanics tests, and one standard subject was selected to develop the finite element model of foot-ankle-knee integration. The joint impact force was used to evaluate the impact loads on the knee at various landing angles. The internal load forces (musculoskeletal modeling) and stress (finite element analysis) around the knee joint were simulated and calculated to evaluate the risk of knee-related injury during SL. To more realistically revert and simulate the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury mechanics, we developed a knee musculoskeletal model that reverts the ACL ligament to a nonlinear short-term viscoelastic mechanical mechanism (strain rate-dependent) generated by the dense connective tissue as a function of strain. Results: As the ankle plantarflexion angle increased during landing, both the peak knee vertical impact force (p = 0.001) and ACL force (p = 0.001) decreased significantly. The maximum von Mises stress of ACL, meniscus, and femoral cartilage decreased as the ankle plantarflexion angle increased. The overall range of variation in ACL stress was small and was mainly distributed in the femoral and tibial attachment regions, as well as in the mid-lateral region. Conclusion: The current findings revealed that the use of larger ankle plantarflexion angles during landing may be an effective solution to reduce knee impact load and the risk of rupture of the medial femoral attachment area in the ACL. The findings of this study have the potential to offer novel perspectives in the optimized application of landing strategies, thus giving crucial theoretical backing for decreasing the risk of knee-related injury.",Embase,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108965,

While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population. Matreials and methods: This was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients. Results: 20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 ñ 1.34 and 98.5 ñ 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 ñ 9.43 and 88.75 ñ 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886ñ22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 ñ 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio.

(2024),2024,Outcomes of ACL Reconstruction Utilizing Supercritical CO(2)-Sterilized Allografts,"Background: Allograft tendons are perceived to have a high ACL graft failure rate in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO2-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. Hypothesis: ACLR with SCCO2 allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO2-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL?Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. Results: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 ñ 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged ó25 years (P =.007). Neither donor age (ó40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P >.05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. Conclusion: SCCO2 processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft.",Embase,10.1177/23259671241254115,

However, recent studies endorse the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft as a viable alternative. To evaluate this, we systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy of PLT against HT autografts. Our search encompassed Cochrane, Embase, OVID, PubMed, and Scopus databases for RCTs comparing outcomes of PLT and HT autografts in ACL reconstruction. Primary outcomes included Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, while secondary outcomes involved American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, graft diameters and donor-site complications. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) and heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics. 683 patients from 6 RCTs were included, with 338 (49.5%) patients treated with PLT autografts. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 30 months. Despite lower preoperative Lysholm scores in the PLT group, no significant differences were observed at 6 and 12 months. Although preoperative and 6-month IKDC scores were lower in the PLT group, no significant differences were found at 12 and 24 months. AOFAS scores showed no significant preoperative difference, but slightly lower scores were noted in the PLT group at 12 or 24 months. There was no significant difference in graft diameter, while donor-site complications were fewer in the PLT group. In summary, the PLT autograft is a promising and non-inferior alternative to the HT autograft, demonstrating equivalent outcomes in patient-reported knee and ankle metrics, comparable graft diameters and fewer donor-site complications.",Embase,10.1007/s00590-024-03984-w,

PURPOSE: To create an open-access data set on the morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical properties of clinically important tendons and ligaments of the lower limb, using consistent methodologies, to enable direct tendon/ligament comparisons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nineteen distinct lower limb tendons and ligaments were retrieved from 8 fresh-frozen human cadavers (5 male, 3 female; aged 49-65 years) including Achilles, tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, fibularis (peroneus) longus, fibularis (peroneus) brevis, flexor hallucis longus, extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, flexor digitorum longus, quadriceps, patellar, semitendinosus, and gracilis tendons; anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments; and 10 mm-wide grafts from the contralateral quadriceps and patellar tendons. Outcomes included morphology (tissue length, ultrasound-quantified cross-sectional area [CSAUS], and major and minor axes), biomechanics (failure load, ultimate tensile strength [UTS], failure strain, and elastic modulus), and biochemistry (sulfated glycosaminoglycan [sGAG] and hydroxyproline contents). Tissue differences were analyzed using mixed-model regression. RESULTS: There was a range of similarities and differences between tendons and ligaments across outcomes. A key finding relating to potential graft tissue suitability was the comparable failure loads, UTS, CSAUS, sGAG, and hydroxyproline present between hamstring tendons (a standard graft source) and 5 tendons not typically used for grafting: fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus tendons. CONCLUSION: This study of lower limb tendons and ligaments has enabled direct comparison of morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical human tissue properties-key factors in the selection of suitable graft tissues. This analysis has identified 6 potential new donor tissues with properties comparable to currently used grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This extensive data set reduces the need to utilize data from incompatible sources, which may aid surgical decisions (eg, evidence to expand the range of tendons considered suitable for use as grafts) and may provide congruent design inputs for new biomaterials and computational models. The complete data set has been provided to facilitate further investigations, with the capacity to expand the resource to include additional outcomes and tissues.",Embase,10.1177/03635465241260054,
192,EM-48,Li et al. (2024),2024,Effect of graft type on knee function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Grafts are often used to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament in clinical practice, while different types of grafts affect postoperative knee function and the development of rehabilitation programs. OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the effects of different graft types on muscle strength, joint stability, functional activities, and return to sports in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. METHODS: Related studies were searched through PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, CNKI, and WANFANG databases. The Chinese and English key words were ?anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, autografts, allografts, artificial ligaments, bone-patellatendon-bone, quadriceps tendon autograft, hamstring tendon autograft, peroneus longus tendon autograft, rehabilitation, exercise, protocol, return to sport?. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Patients with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts should strengthen centrifugal contraction exercises of quadriceps muscle, and pay attention to the recovery of quadriceps muscle endurance and explosive power in the later stage of rehabilitation. Compared with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts and hamstring tendon grafts, significantly fewer patients with quadriceps tendon grafts met regression criteria within 5-8 months, and a longer training plan should be developed, with the training cycle lasting as long as possible to more than 3 years. The selection of hamstring tendon grafts should strengthen the hamstring muscle strength training under multiple angles, especially the cycle of bending the knee above 60ø until at least 18 weeks after surgery. Patients who choose peroneus longus tendon graft should strengthen the muscle strength around the ankle, mainly the plantar muscle strength. In the selection of allograft, attention should be paid to the reduction of tension resistance of 20% after the graft is disinfected by low-dose radiation, so attention should be paid to knee stability training. Patients who choose artificial ligament grafts can gradually enhance quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength training within 3-6 weeks, pay attention to early proprioceptive exercises, and conduct targeted training on balance, jumping, and flexibility.",Embase,10.12307/2024.478,
193,EM-49,Selcuk et al. (2024),2024,Peroneus longus tendon autograft versus allograft in revision ACLR: A retrospective comparison,"Purpose: The use of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autografts in primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has increased recently, but there is a lack of research on its use in revision ACLR. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and complications between revision ACLR using allografts and PLT autografts. Materials and methods: Fifty-nine patients who underwent arthroscopic revision of ACLR with complete clinical follow-ups between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Allograft was used in 44 of these patients, and PLT autograft was used in 15 of them. Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, Lachman, and anterior drawer tests were performed after a mean follow-up of 60 months (range: 19?116). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to evaluate the donor ankle functions. Clinical outcomes and complications were compared between groups. Results: Both groups showed significantly improved functional outcomes compared to their preoperative assessments. However, both groups had similar clinical results at the final follow-up, including Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity scale, knee range of motion, return to sports, time to return to daily activities, and rate of re-rupture. No major complications were seen in any of the patients. The AOFAS score was 99.13 ñ 2.64 in the PLT autograft group without loss of ankle muscle strength, deformity, instability, and permanent iatrogenic neurovascular injuries. The cumulative cost of the allograft group was significantly higher than the PLT autograft group. Conclusions: The PLT autograft might be an alternative autograft option to allografts due to similar clinical outcomes, low donor site morbidity, and reduced cost in ACLR revisions, especially if the primary ACLR was performed using grafts harvested around the knee. Level of evidence: III; retrospective comparative study.",Embase,10.1016/j.otsr.2023.103775,
194,EM-50,Zhang et al. (2024),2024,The Efficacy of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon and its Impact on Ankle Joint Function,"Objective: Peroneus Longus Tendon (PLT), a viable anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, shares similar biomechanics, making it suitable for reconstruction. Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system?Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. Results: One year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p > 0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p > 0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p < 0.05). Conclusion: ACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles.",Embase,10.1111/os.14060,
195,EM-51,Blanke et al. (2024),2024,An anteromedial stabilization procedure has the most protective effect on the anterior cruciate ligament in tibial external rotation. A human knee model study,"Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains associated with the risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces. Methods: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. Results: The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation. Conclusion: This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces.",Embase,10.1007/s00402-024-05357-8,

Methods: A total of 207 parturients who delivered via vagina were divided into PPH group (n=102) and non-PPH group (n=105). The PPH group was further divided into mild PPH group and severe PPH group. The differences of Fib, platelet (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), D-dimer (D-D), hemoglobin (HGB) and neonatal weight (Nw) between the two groups were compared to explore the significance of these indexes in predicting PPH. Results: Fib, PLT and PDW in PPH group were significantly lower than those in non-PPH group, while D-D and Nw in PPH group were significantly higher than those in non-PPH group. In the binary logistic regression model, we found that Fib, D-D and Nw were independently related to PPH. The risk of PPH increased by 9.87 times for every 1 g/L decrease in Fib. The cut-off value of Fib is 4.395 (sensitivity 0.705, specificity 0.922). The AUC value of PPH predicted by Fib combined with D-D and Nw was significantly higher than that of PPH predicted by Fib (p<0.05, 95 % CI 0.00313-0.0587). Conclusions: Fib, D-D and Nw have good predictive value for PPH of vaginal delivery, among which Fib is the best. The combination of three indexes of Fib, D-D and Nw can predict PPH more systematically and comprehensively, and provide a basis for clinical prevention and treatment of PPH.",Embase,10.1515/jpm-2023-0351,
197,EM-53,Shu et al. (2024),2024,"THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF TELITACICEPT FOLLOWING RITUXIMAB IMMUNOTHERAPY ON ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME, A PROSPECTIVE 24 WEEKS STUDY","Background: Primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), and systemic lupus erythematosus secondary APS (SAPS) are challenging diseases to predict and lack effective therapeutic drugs. Rituximab (RTX) can deplete CD20+ peripheral B cells and Telitacicept (TA) is a dual target inhibitor targeted both BAFF and APRIL. The strategy of TA following RTX immunotherapy is worth discussing in the treatment of APS. Objectives: This study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TA following RTX therapy for refractory/severe APS. Methods: This prospective study enrolled PAPS/SAPS patients were treated with RTX monotherapy or a sequential therapy, that was 200-500mg RTX infusion after screening, then evaluated 4 weeks later (0w) and TA injection (mainly 160mg ih qw) for 24 weeks (24w). The standard background were glucocorticoid (GC), hydroxychloroquine, and anticoagulants/ antiplatelet medications. The complete remission rate (CR) was the proportion of increased antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) or lupus anticoagulant (LA) value decreased to normal range and overall remission rate (OR) was the aPL titers decreased into two times above the normal value or LA decreased to normal range. The incidence of new APS related clinical events, overall remission ratio of thrombocytopenia (TP), and adverse events (AE) were also analysis. Results: There were 21 patients in RTA+TA group and 20 in RTX group who completed this study. During the screening period (before the use of RTX), the triple positivity of aPL in the study was 53.7%, among which the a?2GPI-IgG showed the highest positivity rate at 95.1%. It was observed that the stratification of a?2GP1-IgG and ACL-IgG were higher in the RTX+TA group than in RTX. Among the 4 difference clinical subgroups, the patients only with thrombotic APS (TAPS) showed the highest positive rate of LA, and much higher values of LA, a?2GPI-IgG, ACL-IgG compared to TP, TP+TAPS and Obstetric APS (OAPS) subgroups. After RTA +TA immunotherapy, the values of these aPLs in TAPS group were still higher than others. The median values of ACLIgG and ACL-IgM decreased sharply from 0w to 24w in the TAPS group with additional TA treatment (Table 1). With 24 weeks treatment, the new clinical events occurring ratio was significant lower in the RTX+TA group than in the RTX group (1/21 vs. 6/20) (Figure 1A). There were eight patients with TP in each treatment group. The PLT count in the RTX+TA group was significantly lower than that in the RTX group during the screening period, while at baseline and 24 weeks timepoint, the data in the RTX+TA group were higher than in the RTX group. The OR rates of a?2GPI-IgA, a?2GPI-IgM, ACL-IgM, ACL-IgA, and ACL-IgG in the RTX+TA group were more than 50%, especially the OR of a?2GPI-IgA and a?2GPI-IgM were significantly higher than RTX group. It was obviously that all aPL values in the RTX+TA group were significantly lower compared to both the screening and baseline timepoint (after RTX treatment and before TA administration). However, in the RTX group, only the LA value at 24 weeks significantly decreased from that of the screening timepoint (Figure 1B-1H). The decreased values were also different between the two groups, the reduction of aPL values was higher in the RTX+TA group. Both groups received a GC dose of 10 mg/d during the screening period, and the RTX+TA group exhibited a lower dose than the RTX group at 24 weeks (5.0 mg/d vs 7.5 mg/d, p=0.011). AE was mild in both treatment patients, including 14 RTX infusion-related reactions and two RTX-associated secondary infections, primarily occurring within one month after infusion. TA injection had 5 slight and one moderate local reactions. No additional infections were reported after the administration of TA. Conclusion: In this 24w observational study, TA followed with RTX therapy was a promising strategy for refractory/severe APS. This immunotherapy strategy effectively reduced the incidence of new-onset APS-related events and lowered aPL values without increasing the number of new infections using TA.

Aim of the Work: This study aims to assess the efficiency of PLT autograft as a good alternative graft choice for ACLR and to outline the advantages and disadvantages of its use. Methodology: We searched the literature through PUBMED, Cochrane library, Medscape, direct science, JBJS and Google scholar with publication date restricted to 10 years range from 2012-2022. English literature of prospective studies only were selected with strict inclusion criteria where human studies undergoing Arthroscopic ACLR using PLT autograft which commenting on clinical +/- imaging outcomes and repeated studies excluded. Eleven studies were included satisfying the predetermined inclusion criteria with total of 564 patients. Four literatures compared ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus Hamstring tendon,1 literature versus Semitendinosus graft and another versus Patellar tendon. After pooling of collected data from the desired search studies, the relative risk of each of intended outcome measures of interest was calculated and tabulated according to IKDC and AOFAS score. Results: In 4 literatures, in total, outcomes of 108 PLT versus 129 HT autografts were analyzed with mean follow up 10.5 months, reported little difference was found between the two grafts in favor of PLT autograft, with mean score 95.58 for PLT versus 91.65 for HT. Outcomes of 15 PLT versus 15 semitendinosus autografts were analyzed. PLT autograft gave better clinical and biomechanical outcomes than semitendinosus graft as mean IKDC score was 91.58 for PLT versus 88.37 for semitendinosus graft. Outcomes of 50 PLT versus 50 Patellar tendon autografts were analyzed and reported that PLT autograft has better IKDC score than patellar tendon autograft (96.8 versus 95.1) and lower graft rupture rate (6% versus 10%). In 5 literatures, in total, outcomes of 189 patients, had ACLR using PLT autograft, were analyzed after mean follow up 12.4 months and revealed that mean IKDC score was increased from 64.7 preoperative to 97.8 postoperative. PLT harvest does not appear to affect foot and ankle function to any clinically significant degree with slightly decreased AOFAS score (96.88 ñ 4.95). Conclusion: PLT autograft consider a very promising and ideal graft option for ACLR with excellent functional and biomechanical outcomes.

(2024),2024,Association of Posterior Tibial Slope With Outcomes After Multiligamentous Knee Reconstruction for Knee Dislocation Grades 2 to 4,"Background: Patients with isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction have demonstrated an increased risk of ACL graft failure and lower patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores when increased posterior tibial slope (PTS) is present. However, there is a paucity of literature evaluating the effect of PTS on outcomes after combined bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstruction. Purpose: To determine whether differences exist for graft failure rates or PRO scores based on PTS after combined bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstruction. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All patients who underwent combined ACL and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction between 2000 and 2020 at our institution were identified. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, knee dislocation grade 5 injuries, concomitant osteotomy procedures, and <2 years of clinical follow-up. Demographic and outcomes data were collected from our prospectively gathered multiligamentous knee injury database. Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were analyzed in relation to PTS. Outcomes were compared for patients with a PTS above and below the mean for the total cohort, PTS >12ø versus <12ø, positive versus negative Lachman test at follow-up, and positive versus negative posterior drawer test at follow-up. Results: A total of 98 knees in 98 patients were included in the study, with a mean clinical follow-up of 5.1 years (median, 4.6 years; range, 2-16 years). The mean PTS was 8.7ø (range, 0.4ø-16.9ø). Linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between PTS and IKDC or Lysholm scores. Patients with a PTS above the mean of 8.7ø trended toward lower IKDC (P =.08) and Lysholm (P =.06) scores. Four patients experienced ACL graft failure and 5 patients experienced PCL graft failure. There were no differences in graft failure rates or PRO scores for patients with a PTS >12ø. Patients with a positive Lachman test trended toward higher PTS (9.6ø vs 8.5ø, P =.15). Conclusion: In this series of bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstructions at midterm follow-up, no differences in graft failures, complications, reoperations, revisions, or PRO scores based on PTS were identified. Patients with a positive Lachman test were found to have a slightly higher PTS, although this did not reach statistical significance.",Embase,10.1177/23259671241249473,
200,EM-56,Delcogliano et al. (2024),2024,Platelet-rich plasma augmentation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Evidence is still too scattered. A scoping review of randomised controlled trials,"PURPOSE: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation has been proposed to improve the results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The present study aims to quantify the available evidence to support the use of PRP as biological augmentation in ACLR surgery. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on the PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science and Embase databases on 10 March 2023. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), written in English, addressing PRP augmentation in ACLR surgery, with no time limitation. A scoping review was performed to map the body of literature by examining the evidence related to specific aspects of patients' treatment and evaluation. Risk of bias evaluation was performed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials Version 2 (RoB 2), while the quality assessment was performed with the use of the Coleman Score. RESULTS: Out of 983 articles retrieved, 23 RCTs on 943 knees were included in this scoping review. PRP was administered in a liquid form in nine studies and clotted in 11 studies, while in three studies both liquid and clotted PRP were used. Hamstring auto/allografts were used in 14 studies, patellar tendon auto/allografts were used in eight studies and one study described ACLR with peroneus longus allografts. The map of the evidence documented high heterogeneity also in terms of surgical technique, objective and subjective outcome measures and radiological assessment, as well as follow-up times ranging from 1 day to 2 years, with virtually no overlapping data among studies neither in terms of treatments nor evaluations. Risk of bias evaluation showed an overall low quality of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature addressing PRP augmentation in ACLR is largely scattered. PRP was produced and applied following different procedures, and high variability was detected across the included studies for every aspect of ACLR surgery and evaluation. Currently, a meaningful comparison of the available studies is not possible as the quantification of the literature results is biased by their heterogeneity. Future studies should provide more standardisation to investigate the benefits of biological augmentation in ACL surgery and confirm the promising yet weak evidence of PRP potential as well as the most suitable application modality, before routine use in clinical practice.

Methods: A comprehensive search of published literature in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid, and EMBASE databases was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria included patients undergoing ACLR with PLT autograft, inclusion of patient-recorded outcome measures, and availability in English language. Publications that included only biomechanical analysis or ACLR with use of allograft or combination grafts were excluded. Results: A total of 16 studies (Level of Evidence range: I-IV) met inclusion criteria, with follow-up ranging from 3 months to 5 years. In the available case series, patient-reported outcomes ranged from Lysholm = 80.7 to 95.1, International Knee Documentation Committee 78.1 to 95.7. In prospective cohorts and randomized controlled trials, PLT performance was comparable with HT autografts (PLT/HT: Lysholm = 88.3-95.1/86.5-94.9, International Knee Documentation Committee = 78.2-92.5/87.4-93.4). The majority of PLT grafts diameters were equal or greater than HT counterparts with a mean of >8 mm (PLT/HT: 7.0-9.0 mm/7.65-8.5 mm). There was minimal donor-site morbidity associated with PLT harvest. Conclusions: Although limitations exist within the available literature, existing evidence suggests that PLT autograft routinely produces adequately sized grafts with comparable early outcomes to HT autograft and low risk of donor-site morbidity. However, the PLT autograft is yet to demonstrate superiority to any of the more-traditional autograft selections.

202,EM-58,,2024,Effect of ACL Reconstruction Using Peroneus Longus Versus Hamstring Autografts on Biomechanical Properties of Ankle Joint Complex,"Brief Summary BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important ligamentous structure in the knee joint which contributes in maintaining stability. ACL injury contribute to approximately 50% of knee injuries .The incidence of ACL ruptures is estimated to be between 30 and 78 per 100,000 people per year . The incidence of ACL ruptures varies depending on a number of factors, including age, sex, sport participation, and genetics. ACL ruptures are most common in young adults, particularly women. The risk of an ACL rupture has been reported as 2-8 times higher for women than for men. A systematic review study found that the risk of ACL injury was highest in football, followed by soccer, basketball, and skiing . Nowadays, Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft is used in orthopaedic surgeries. Some studies reported that PLT graft had maintained a possible more efficient ACL substitute for its tensile strength and regeneration ability after being inserted post-surgery . The PLT graft has additional benefit as it does not cause secondary injury to the knee and its adjacent structures . Ankle proprioception is one of the crucial components contributing to postural control . PLT graft for ACL reconstruction might affect the already compromised body balance by influencing postural stability and ankle stability at the donor ankle site. So, this study will be conducted to assess and compare the effect of ACLreconstruction with PLT graft to the effect of ACL reconstruction with HT graft on ankle stability and postural control .

Several growth factors, cytokine, chemokine, and protease inhibitors functions in stimulation of paracrine reactions in fibroblast, endothelial, and stem cells thereby promoting the tissue restorative processes. Augmented with dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft reinforces the reconstructed ligament and aids in effective restoration. Materials and methods: In this case control study 15 patients undertaking ACL reconstruction with tripled peroneus augmented dHACM (G1) were prospectively monitored up for a period of 8 months along with 15 control patients (G2) without dHACM augmentation. Clinical and radiological outcomes were analysed and assessed about effect of augmenting the peroneus longus graft using dHACM. Clinical analysis included pre-operative two, four, six, and eight months post-operative Tegnor-Lysholm score, and radiological analysis included the 6th month postoperative MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements by mean signal-value at femoral insertion, midsubstance and tibial insertion of ACL graft. Results: Clinically, as a mean Lysholm score of all patients, they were revealed to be consecutively high in G1 than in Group 2 at four, six, and eight months. The signal-to-noise ratio from the MRI results showed majority having good healing in G1 group. Conclusions: Based on 6-month MRI, an effective ligamentization (SNR<75) was noticed in 53.33% of patients in the dHACM allograft enhanced group on comparison with 33% in the controls.

204,EM-60,Acharya et al. (2024),2024,Functional Outcomes of Anatomic Single Bundle Primary ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon (Without a Peroneal Tenodesis) Versus Hamstring Autografts,"Objectives: There is a paucity of comparative studies on the Peroneus longus tendon versus conventional hamstring autograft use in primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction. To date, there are no studies that reported donor ankle functional outcomes when a peroneus longus graft is harvested without performing a tenodesis to peroneus brevis. Methods: A single-center retrospective comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcomes (IKDC & Tegner-Lysholm scores) of primary isolated single bundle anatomic ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus tendon (PL group) versus Hamstring (HT group) autografts. Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. Results: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/- 0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/- 0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre-op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre-op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre-op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre-op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/- 2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon appears to be a better autograft choice than hamstrings for primary ACL reconstruction.

(2024),2024,The role of peroneus longus (PL) autograft in the reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL): A comprehensive narrative review,"Background: Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is a known graft utilised in the ligamentous reconstructions of knee. The current review was performed to analyze the available evidence regarding PLT in the arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: A comprehensive search of literature was performed on March 1, 2023 using 5 databases (for manuscripts published between 2010 and 2023). All studies reporting ACL reconstruction with PL graft in adults ò18 years were considered; and final studies were shortlisted based on specific exclusion criteria. Results: The search identified 684 articles, among which 26 manuscripts were finally selected. PLT has been used in primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR), revision ACLR, ACLR in multiligamentous injuries and those at risk for anterior knee pain. The full-thickness PLT graft is variable in its dimensions with the mean size ranging between 7 and 8.8 mm (half-PLT grafts ó8.1 mm). The ultimate strength of doubled PLT graft is significantly higher than native ACL and comparable to the quadrupled hamstring. There was statistically insignificant difference in the laxity and functional outcome of knee following ACLR with PLT, as compared with other autografts (p > 0.05). PLT harvest is associated with satisfactory clinical foot and ankle outcomes, as well as excellent regenerative ability. Overall, studies have demonstrated lower complications with PLT (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The dimensions of harvested PLT graft are more consistent than HT. It has similar functional outcome and survival, as compared to other autografts. It also has lower risk for donor-site morbidity and lower complications than HT. PLT is a promising, alternative autograft choice in patients undergoing ACLR.",Embase,10.1016/j.jcot.2024.102352,
206,EM-62,Zhao et al. (2024),2024,The effect of harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon on foot morphology and gait,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the strength of the graft was found to be unsatisfactory usually the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was taken for supplementation, but the effect on foot and ankle function and gait in the donor area is unclear. This study aims to explore the changes in the ankle and gait after using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a reconstruction graft for the anterior cruciate ligament. METHODS: A total of 20 patients, 6 males and 14 females, aged 18 to 44 years, with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries, underwent reconstruction using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft between June 2021 and December 2021. The part on which the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was harvested was considered the experimental group, while the contralateral foot was the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups. RESULTS: All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P > 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the gait cycle parameters, including the percentage of time in the stance, mid-stance, and push-off phases, as well as foot strike angle and push-off angle (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Through our study of the surgical experimental group we have shown that harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon does not affect foot morphology and gait parameters; however, it does impact the gait cycle.",Embase,10.1186/s13018-023-04429-6,

(2024),2024,Comparative Analysis of Functional Outcomes and Donor Site Morbidity in ACL Reconstruction: Peroneus Longus Tendon versus Hamstring Tendon Autografts,"Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction commonly employs hamstring tendon autografts, but alternative sources like the peroneus longus tendon have gained attention. This study aimed to compare functional outcomes and donor site morbidity between peroneus longus and hamstring autografts for ACL reconstruction. Methodology: Forty patients underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autografts, while another 40 received hamstring tendon autografts. Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up assessments included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, graft diameter measurements, knee stability evaluations, and ankle range of motion assessments. Results: Functional scores (IKDC and Lysholm) showed substantial improvements postoperatively in both groups, with no significant differences between preoperative scores. Graft diameter differed significantly, with the peroneus longus tendon exhibiting a larger diameter. Knee stability, laxity, and ankle range of motion demonstrated no significant differences between the two groups. Conclusion: Despite variations in graft diameter, both peroneus longus and hamstring tendon autografts yielded comparable functional outcomes and knee stability post-ACL reconstruction. Ankle range of motion remained unaffected following peroneus longus tendon harvesting. These findings suggest the viability of peroneus longus tendon as an alternative autograft choice for ACL reconstruction.",Embase,,
208,EM-64,Suna et al. (2024),2024,ACL Reconstruction with Quadrupled Hamstring Tendon Graft-A Prospective Outcome Study,"Introduction: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is one of the common sports injuries encountered. It is a very important ligament in knee which contributes to the stability of the knee joint. Reconstructing ACL is essential to prevent early onset osteoarthritis of the knee joint as well as to have better functional outcome. There are numerous autograft options like bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Hamstring graft and peroneus longus graft with their own merits and demerits. The present study is intended to study the functional outcome follow-ing ACL reconstruction with quadrupled hamstring graft. Methods and materials: Patients with ACL injury and those who have met inclusion and exclusion criteria are included in the study. After thorough pre-op evaluation, the patients are treated with reconstruction of ACL with quadrupled hamstring graft. They are assessed pre-operatively and post-operatively up to 9 months by doing Lachman test, Anterior Drawer test, Pivot shift test and few functional scores like Lysholm knee score and IKDC subjective knee evaluation score. Thus, the functional outcome of knee is assessed. Results: Among the 32 patients, who are included in the study, 28 are males. Right limbs are more commonly involved. In this study, RTA is the most common mechanism of injury. About 10 cases are also associated with meniscal injuries. The average IKDC score among the isolated ACL injury cases is 88.6 and in those associated with meniscal injuries is 86.3. About 75.4% of patients showed better outcome in the study. Conclusion: Anatomical reconstruction of ACL is key for better functional outcomes in knees with ACL injury. Better functional outcome is seen in isolated ACL injuries compared to ACL injuries with meniscal involvement. ACL reconstruction with quadrupled hamstring graft is one of the reliable methods which provides better results. It is not associated with much donor site morbidity.",Embase,,

Continued: Storage for 0 to 4 months,"The role of donor-derived tendons, also known as allografts, in anterior cruciate ligament replacement surgeries is steadily increasing. Before surgery, temporary storage and, in most cases, sterilization are essential. It is, thus, crucial to determine how these procedures alter the grafts? biomechanical properties. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of different sterilization methods (native, frozen, frozen + 21 kGy gamma irradiation, frozen + 21 kGy electron beam irradiation) and storage durations (0 to 4 months) on the deformation and creep of two tendon types (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus). 80 tibialis anterior and 83 peroneus longus tendons from 51 human cadavers were included. The samples were removed, placed in a radio-cryoprotectant solution, then slowly cooled, sterilized and stored at ?80 øC. All groups were subject to 60 s static creep test with 250 N load. Deformation during the loading phase, creep during static loading, and the ratio of these two were evaluated. Deformation at the end of the loading phase and creep consistently exhibited significantly smaller values in the tibialis anterior compared to the peroneus longus type, as well as in electron beam-sterilized grafts as opposed to gamma beam-sterilized ones. Prolonged storage periods (within 0 to 4 months) resulted in a notable increase in these values, particularly in deformation. Based on the experimental data, the tibialis anterior tendon type and sterilization by gamma beam irradiation are better choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than the peroneus longus and sterilization by electron beam. Increased storage time affects negatively the evaluated mechanical properties.",Embase,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2023.111904,

212,EM-68,Sathish et al. (2024),2024,A Prospective Study on Functional Outcome at Donor Site Following Peroneus Longus Graft Harvest for Knee Ligament Reconstruction in a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India,"Background: Knee ligament reconstruction is widely performed all over the world and graft choice for the same has been always an area of research. Currently the most preferred grafts include the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BPTB) and the hamstring graft. However, there are some significant donor site morbidities associated with these grafts. Thus, we have used peroneus longus tendon as the graft which was found to have similar functional outcomes compared to hamstring graft and assessed functional outcome at the donor site associated with it. Methods: Patients who required a knee ligament reconstruction were selected and Peroneus longus tendon was harvested as graft. The patients were followed up for 12 months post operatively. Functional scoring was done with AOFAS Ankle and Hindfoot scoring and Visual Analogue Scale-Foot and Ankle (VAS-FA) were used. Also, the power of foot eversion and plantar flexion was tested and recorded clinically by MRC grading. Results: 30 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (22 male and 08 female patients). Follow up period was 12 months. The mean pre and postoperative AOFAS-AH score was 99.27 ñ 0.94 and 99.13 ñ 1.01 respectively at 12 months follow up. The mean pre and postoperative VAS-FA score was 98.53 ñ 1.38 and 98.00 ñ1.34 respectively at 12 months follow up (p value > 0.05). The 12 months postoperative power of eversion and plantar flexion were grade 5 in all patients. Conclusion: There was no significant difference of functional outcome and muscle power was noted postoperatively (at one year follow up) at the donor site following PLT graft harvest. Also, the surgical procedure of graft harvest was simple with less operative time with early wound healing and no complications postoperatively. Thus, we conclude that peroneus longus tendon can be used safely as a graft for ligament reconstruction with no significant donor site morbidities.",Embase,,

Several graft possibilities are available, including (BPTB), four-strand hamstring autografts, quadriceps tendon, and peroneus longus tendon. Each has both advantages and cons. This study compares the effectiveness of peroneus longus and hamstring tendon autografts for single bundle ACL restoration. Patients and Methods: The study involved 60 patients. Thirty of them had their torn anterior cruciate ligaments reconstructed arthroscopically using hamstring tendons, while the other 30 had their ACLs managed arthroscopically with peroneus longus tendon. The follow-up period lasted at least 12 months. Patients were assessed using IKDC score and Lysholm score. Ankle function was assessed using AOFAS score. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in preoperative and postoperative range of motion improvement in each group as an IKDC score item. However, no statistically significant difference existed between both groups. A statistically significant change in Lysholm scores preoperatively and postoperatively in each group was detected, but there was no statistical difference between groups 1 and 2, either in terms of improvement or percentage improvement. The AOFAS score was used also to assess for any donor site morbidity. No significant difference was detected between both ankles range of motion and no ankle joint dysfunction or problems with sports activities. Conclusion: The current study found that the PL tendon autograft might be considered a safe, effective and a technically easy graft option for ACLR.

(2024),2024,A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION USING VARIOUS GRAFTS,"Background: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the primary stabilizer of the knee and prevents the knee from anterior translation. It is also crucial for balancing valgus and rotational stress. An established and often performed surgical treatment with a low morbidity profile and demonstrated success is ACL reconstruction. Objectives: The present study was designed to study the functional assessment of ACL reconstruction using various grafts. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 18 patients admitted with clinical and radiological deficiency of ACL, Department of Orthopaedics, Gandhi Hospital, Secunderabad. Functional assessment of ACL reconstruction using various grafts, assess the functional outcome of arthroscopy-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadrupled semitendinosus tendon graft using endobutton and bioabsorbable interference screw in terms of range of motion, postoperative knee stability, graft site morbidity, subjective knee functions and prospective assessment of functional outcome using tegner lysholm knee scoring system. Results: In our study, the majority of the cases i.e. 14 (77.78%) were in the age group of 21-40 years, followed by 3 (16.66%) cases in the age group 41-60 years. Of 8 cases (44.44%) affected were due to slip and fall. In the present study, hamstring tendon autografts were used in 10 (55.56%) cases, peroneus longus graft was used in 6 (33.33%) cases while bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft was used in 2 (11.11%) cases. Postoperative knee pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale. In two patients in BPTB, 1 (50%) patient had mild pain while flexing the knee and 1 (50%) patient had experienced no knee pain. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results of our study substantiate the similarities between the grafts found in previous reports. Good or excellent results can be obtained in most ACL reconstructions using hamstring tendon autografts or peroneus longus grafts.

This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. Material/Methods: ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56ñ0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44ñ0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46ñ3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48ñ4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. Conclusions: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain.

Recent interest has focused on the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) as a potential alternative to hamstring tendons (HT) due to its biomechanical properties and potential advantages. However, comparative studies assessing functional outcomes between PLT and HT in ACLR are lacking. We conducted a cross?sectional study involving 60 ACL injury cases treated with ACL reconstruction using either hamstring or peroneus longus tendon grafts. Patient selection was randomized, and assessments included preoperative planning, surgery under spinal or combined spinal?epidural anesthesia, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols. Functional scores were assessed using the Lysholm Knee Score and IKDC Score at various follow?up intervals. Both groups showed favorable outcomes in terms of knee stability and functional scores. There were no statistically significant differences in Lysholm and IKDC scores between the two groups at any time point during the follow?up period. Additionally, postoperative complications did not significantly differ between the groups. The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autografts yields comparable outcomes to hamstring tendon autografts in terms of knee stability and functional scores. The use of peroneus longus tendon grafts may offer advantages such as larger size, satisfactory ankle function preservation and avoidance of potential complications associated with hamstring graft harvesting.

While various autograft options exist for ACL reconstruction, each has associated drawbacks. The peroneus longus tendon has emerged as a promising alternative, but literature on its functional outcomes remains limited. The objective is to evaluate the functional outcomes of primary ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 31 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft at BLDE (Deemed to be University) Shri B. M.

Functional outcomes were assessed using Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Return to pre-injury activity levels and complications were also evaluated. Result: The mean Lysholm score improved from 46.41 ñ 6.5 preoperatively to 96.61 ñ 3.22 at 12 months postoperatively. The mean IKDC score increased from 41.87 ñ 6.91 preoperatively to 91.12 ñ 6.86 at 12 months postoperatively. Both improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Twenty-eight patients (91%) returned to their pre-injury activity level, with 20 (64.5%) resuming sports activities. Minor complications were observed in 16.2% of cases, with no major complications requiring revision surgery. Conclusion: ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft demonstrates excellent functional outcomes, high rates of return to pre-injury activity levels, and a low complication rate.

In ACL injury, patient develops knee instability and pain. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction(ACLR) provides surgical restoration of the injured ACL using the placement of graft material. Hamstrings are one of the commonest grafts used for ACL reconstruction. Inadequate graft size, difficulty harvesting, loss of the synergistic muscles for ACL injured knees are some of the common issues associated with hamstrings. We studied the outcome of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon graft as an alternative graft source that obviates the above mentioned disadvantages of commonly used hamstring grafts. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study in 30 patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon autograft. The patients were followed up for 12 months post-operatively. Functional scores were assessed using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Cincinnati Knee Rating System for knee and AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) Ankle-Hindfoot scoring and Visual Analogue Scale - Foot and Ankle (VAS-FA) for ankle. Also power of foot eversion and first ray plantarflexion were tested and recorded clinically by MRC (Medical Research Council) grading. Result: 30 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (23 male and 7 female patients). Follow-up period was 12 months. Mean IKDC score (81.80) and mean Cincinnati score (363.67) showed significant improvement at 12 month post-operative when compared to pre-operative scores which are 39.6 and 145.33 respectively (p value < 0.05).

The 12 month postoperative power of eversion and plantarflexion were grade 5 in all patients. Conclusion: Signifanct improvement in knee functional outcome and no significant difference of functional status and muscle power pre operatively and postoperatively were found at the donor site following PLT graft harvest. Also the surgical procedure of graft harvest was simple with early wound healing and no complications postoperatively.

They are randomly divided into 2 groups either ACLR plus ALL reconstruction or ACLR combined with LET in a 1:1 ratio. There are multiple graft options for ACL-R, but here for the study, the hamstring autograft is harvested following the traditional technique. The graft is measured and bony tunnels are drilled. An anatomical reconstruction technique is used in all cases. In group A: the surgeon will harvest peroneus longus graft, then sutured to the double bundle hamstring graft. The graft diameters are measured and recorded. The graft is pulled through the femoral tunnel and passed through the tibial tunnel. The single portion of the graft is passed freely through the tibial and femoral tunnels until the quintuple graft portion occupies both tunnels. The graft is then pulled, and an interference screw (Smith \& Nephew Endoscopy) is fixed to the femur. The next step is to fix the inferior end of the quintuple graft to the tibia after pre-tensioning. After tibial fixation, the remaining PL is passed through the subcutaneous and ALL tunnels. The ligament is fixed under traction, mild valgus stress, and 30' of flexion 1.5 cm from the joint line into a midpoint between Gerdy's tubercle and the fibular head. In group B: the surgeon will use a triple STG hamstring (6- strands) tendon graft. The graft diameters are measured and recorded. Then, LET is performed in a standardized fashion as described in the modified Lemaire technique. LET is fixed with interference screws (Smith \& Nephew Endoscopy). Femoral and tibial fixations are performed with bio-absorbable interference screws (Smith \& Nephew Endoscopy).",Embase,,

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied.Methods:Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared.Results:The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up.Conclusions:PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level II.

(2023),2023,"Reconstruction of Anterior Cruciate Ligament with Autologous Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft: A Prospective Study in Tertiary Care Hospital, Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh","Background: ACL injuries are commonly associated with sports injuries and road traffic accidents. Incidence of ACL ruptures is estimated to range from 38-78 % per 100000 person years. The primary aim of ACL reconstruction is to restore the function of the ACL and native kinematics of the knee. ACL reconstruction restores the stability of the knee joint and protects the menisci and joint surfaces from further damage. The most preferred graft tissues for ACL reconstruction are hamstrings in view of better cosmesis, satisfactory results and to minimize postoperative mobility. However, use of peroneus tendon graft is increasing in view of simplicity of the technique. Peroneus longus graft harvest is possible due to synergistic action of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. Even some studies suggest that peroneus brevis is more effective evertor than peroneus longus, justifying harvest of peroneus longus tendon. Materials & Methods: We have done 26 cases of ACL injuries treated with arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft at GSL medical college between Jan 2020 to Dec 2020. Cases were followed up for a period of 1 year and have been evaluated based on Lysholm, AOFAS and FADI score systems. Results: In our study, all 26 patients have completed follow up for 1 year (19 male, 7 female). At final follow up anterior drawer test showed normal findings in 80percent, while 20 percent of all examined patients had 1+ anterior laxity. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon is a promising autograft for ACL reconstruction with advantage of simplicity of harvesting technique, larger graft diameter, minimal graft complications.",Embase,,

(2023),2023,Reference intervals of complete blood count and coagulation tests in Vietnamese pregnant women,"Background: Pregnancy has major effects that make hematology parameters outside of normal reference ranges. Therefore, we conducted this study to establish reference intervals for Vietnamese pregnant women. Methods: From June 2023 to Augst 2023, blood samples from 879 eligible pregnant women were run on DxH 900 hematology analyzer and ACL TOP 550 coagulation analyzer. The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference intervals. Results: PT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count. The reference intervals for PT (seconds), APTT (seconds), fibrinogen (mg/dL), in the first trimester were 10.30?12.88, 25.40?35.46, 280.28?559.00, in the second trimester were 9.80?11.66, 24.05?33.23, 347.75?593.35, in the third trimester were 9.60?11.40, 23.40?31.80, 330.28?628.56, respectively. The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (? 109/L), RBC (? 1012/L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (? 109/L) in the first trimester were 6.33?15.24, 3.73?5.32, 10.33?13.95, 32.22?42.29, 169.66?413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99?15.55, 3.33?4.98, 9.71?13.17, 30.26?40.07, 172.34?372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22?14.14, 3.54?4.98, 9.80?13.97, 31.11?42.70, 151.30?417.14, respectively. Conclusions: Most established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.

Anterior closed-wedge osteotomy is an effective surgical approach to mitigate this risk factor but presents several disadvantages. We describe in this Technical Note an original PTS correction technique called the posterior open-wedge osteotomy. The posterior surface of the proximal tibia is exposed, and 2 K-wires are inserted anteroposteriorly as osteotomy guides, and one wire is inserted mediolaterally as a hinge blocker. The osteotomy is performed from the posterior side and advanced to the anterior side using a single-bladed reciprocating saw. The slope is corrected by opening the osteotomy plane posteriorly with a spreader. The correction is maintained by inserting the harvested fibula fragments into the open space, and the fixation is completed with a locking plate to ensure firm fixation and allow early rehabilitation. This procedure can be an effective solution for patients with various risk factors for retear of the anterior cruciate ligament graft, including abnormal PTS.",Embase,10.1016/j.eats.2023.07.059,

But there are potential risks and complications associated with its use as a graft. This retrospective study aimed to examine the complications and donor site morbidity following PLT harvesting. Patients and methods: A retrospective review was performed on an institutional digital patient database, and all patients who underwent ligament reconstruction using PLT autograft were identified. Intraoperative, early, and late complications were reviewed using digital patient notes and patients underwent a complete physical examination during their final follow-up. Ankle function was assessed using the AOFAS score, and manual ankle muscle testing was performed on both sides. Sural nerve iatrogenic injury was evaluated with a dermatomal light touch examination. Cosmetic satisfaction due to incision scar and footwear complaints were also assessed. Results: 82 patients (74 male, eight female) with a mean age of 31.9 ñ 10.4 years (range, 16?66) were included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up time was 46.6 ñ 30.3 months (range, 6?109). The mean AOFAS score for the donor side was 98.7 ñ 3.3 (range, 87?100), and the contralateral side score was 100, with manual muscle testing graded as 5 in all movements and similar to the contralateral side. Fifteen patients (18.3%) had hypoesthesia over the dorsolateral aspect of the foot distal to the incision scar, two patients (2.4%) had hyperalgesia over the distal incision scar, and one patient (1.2%) had mild ankle instability. There were two cases (2.4%) of compartment syndrome, both of which were treated with fasciotomy and had complete regression of symptoms after 5 days. One patient (1.2%) had a transient peroneal nerve injury and foot drop that resolved in the sixth month. Conclusions: The results of this retrospective study suggest that harvesting the PLT is associated with a high rate of complications and donor site morbidity. The most common complication was hypoesthesia around the lateral side of the foot, although the ankle functions were not affected significantly. Two cases of compartment syndrome and one transient peroneal nerve injury were observed. Care should be taken while harvesting PLT autograft, and it should be kept in mind that peroneal nerve injury might occur.

226,EM-82,Friedman & Madsen (2023),2023,Perceived ankle instability and cutaneous reflex modulation during gait,"Cutaneous reflex modulation during rhythmic ambulation is an important motor control mechanism to help minimize stumbling following an unexpected perturbation. Previous literature found individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) experience altered reflex patterns compared to healthy controls. Considering CAI is characterized by intermittent feelings of ankle instability, researchers have speculated that these alterations are related to perceived instability. Our purpose was to determine whether variability and magnitude of cutaneous reflex amplitudes can predict perceived instability levels following sural nerve stimulation during gait. Forty subjects walked while receiving random stimulations and reported their perceived instability. Middle latency reflexes among lower leg muscles were calculated using data derived from surface electromyography. Hierarchical logistical regressions revealed a positive relationship between reflex variability of the peroneus longus and lateral gastrocnemius muscles and perceived instability during midstance. This suggests subjects with consistent reflexes following sural nerve stimulation develop a certain level of perceptual expectation resulting in generally lower feelings of ankle instability, while subjects with more variable motor outputs perceive greater instability at the supraspinal level. Cutaneous reflex variability during stance may be an important objective outcome measure to monitor neuromuscular recovery throughout a rehabilitation or as a potential predictor of future lateral ankle sprains.",Embase,10.14814/phy2.15880,

228,EM-84,,2023,Role of Sensory Deficits and the Effect of Sensory Stimulation on Sensorimotor Control and Neuromuscular Performance in Athletes With Chronic Ankle Instability,"Brief Summary Purpose: Chronic ankle instability (CAI), characterized by instances of repetitive sprains and giving way, is a common chronic dysfunction among athletes. Despite well documented evidence showing impaired peripheral sensory and both central and peripheral motor control, little was known regarding how CAI affects somatosensory cortical activation. Traditionally, management of CAI mostly focused on restoration of motor deficits, with less emphasis on sensory pathway deficits. Only few sensory targeted intervention methods including joint mobilization and massage, have been described. However, methods such as joint mobilization provide not only sensory stimulation but also mechanical alignment correction. In addition, these studies showed functional improvement without exploring mechanisms. Therefore we would like to apply for a three year study grant to firstly investigate the effect of CAI on peripheral and central somatosensation and neuromuscular performance; and secondly to examine the immediate effect of sensory-level electrical stimulation on neurophysiological variables and neuromuscular performance; and lastly to determine the short-term effect of intervention (sensory stimulation with exercise, sham stimulation with exercise, and exercise alone) in athletes with CAI. Research design and methods: This is a cross-sectional exploratory and randomized controlled study. For the first year, we plan to recruit 45 young athletes (20-40 years old) with CAI and 15 matched controls to compare the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), corticomuscular coherence (CMC), à- band event-related desynchronization (ERD), proprioception, two point discrimination threshold of the plantar surfaces, muscle activation and reaching distances of the Y balance test. Activity in the sensorimotor cortex will be recorded using a 64-chanel EEG (SAGA 32/64+ for EEG). Muscle activation is measured using an 8-channel electromyography (EMG) system (Noraxon myo METRICS Portable Lab, Noraxon U.S.A.). For the second year, the 45 young adults with CAI will be randomized into the sensory stimulation (TENS) group, the sham stimulation group, or the control group. The TENS group will receive 40 minutes of sensory electrical stimulation, and the sham group will receive 30 seconds of sensory stimulation at the beginning and end of the treatment. The control group will rest for 40 minutes. The assessment items are identical to those in the first year, and will be carried out before and immediately after the intervention. For the third year, the 45 young adults with CAI will be randomized into the exercise with sensory stimulation (EX-TENS) group, exercise with sham stimulation (EX-ss) group, or exercise alone (EX) group. Participants will receive five sessions of intervention (30 minutes neuromuscular training with or without 40 min stimulation) within two weeks and the assessment will be carried out before and after the intervention. Data analysis: Comparisons of all continuous variables are performed using oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA), and repeated measures ANOVA. The significance level is set at 0.05. Significance. Results of this study provide a better understanding for central somatosensory control mechanisms for chronic ankle instability, and help clinicians and trainers to choose the most appropriate training strategy for people with unstable ankles. We plan to present our work in 3-4 international conferences, and publish 2-3 papers in SCI journals in 5 years. Detailed Description Characteristics of the chronic ankle instability (CAI): Lateral ankle sprain is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries in the sports clinics. The high prevalence of lateral ankle sprains, combined with a high recurrence rate and persistent post sprain symptoms make lateral ankle sprains and their sequelae a significant health impact and healthcare burden. Although lateral ankle sprains are generally considered benign injuries, it is estimated that 40% of individuals with lateral ankle sprains will subsequently develop chronic ankle instability within the first year after a lateral ankle sprain. Chronic ankle instability is characterized by repetitive sprains, perceived instability, and giving way, which can be classified into two categories: mechanical and functional ankle instability. Mechanical instability of the ankle is a result of loss of mechanical structural constraints (i.e., ligaments); whereas functional instability refers to instability related to altered postural control and reduced functional capacity due to impaired sensorimotor control including altered muscle recruitment around the ankle and impairment of the proprioceptive system etc.. In addition to interfering with sporting performance, and CAI has been found to be associated with lower quality of life and increased likelihood (68%-75%) of developing ankle arthritis. Hertel reported that individuals with ankle instability had higher risk of recurrent ankle sprains, and the treatment for symptoms of CAI could be time-consuming and costly. Numerous impairments have been reported associated with CAI, ranging from loss of joint mobility and muscle strength, compromised proprioception and sensation, poor postural control and neuromuscular performance, and altered movement patterns. However, the mechanisms and management strategies are still not clearly understood in many aspects. And thus, a great variety of intervention has been proposed with inconsistent results reported. Conceptual model for the development of CAI: The theory linking poor neuromuscular control and CAI has been discussed for more than half a century. It was believed that after the ankle sprain, some of the joint receptors and peripheral nerve fibers around the ankle joint were affected, resulting in impaired reflex responses and functional stability of the ankle. More researchers later reported that CAI not only presented with sensory deficits, but also deficits in motor control, and these changes in sensorimotor system would eventually lead to loss of function. In 2019, Hertel et al. (2019) revised the current model for the development of CAI. It is proposed that the initial ankle injury would influence the neural system, disturbing the balance and stability between the sensation, perception and motor function. These disturbances would lead to self-adjustment of the sensorimotor system to attempt to adapt to the altered condition, and consequently might result in long term changes in neural network, and expose individuals to persistent symptoms of instability. This newly revised model integrates both peripheral and central sensorimotor systems to explain the development of CAI; but it clearly shows that the central sensorimotor processing in individuals with CAI is less explored, particularly for the impact of CAI on the somatosensory cortex. Individuals with CAI have poorer neuromuscular performance: The effect of CAI on the neuromuscular control and posture stability has been extensively studied. The research topics of interest included altered reflexes and neuromuscular inhibition, muscle activation patterns (timing, recruitment order, and amplitude) and joint mechanics of the lower extremity segments during sudden inversion perturbation or jump landing, and posture control characteristics during balance testing tasks. It is generally agreed that people with CAI had lower Hmax/Mmax ratios (H reflex/M reflex ratios) of the soleus and peroneus longus muscle than those un-injured controls, indicating that neural excitability of the spinal level in those with CAI was depressed; this population also presented with altered muscle activation of the peroneus, tibialis anterior and soleus muscles, and changed balance control strategies. Recent publications of systematic review and meta-analysis by Hoch and McKeon (2014) and by Thompson et al. (2018) showed that there was a strong evidence to support dynamic balance, peroneal reaction, and eversion strength deficits contributing to CAI. Because of the strong evidence showing motor impairment in CAI, the dominant intervention strategy for this population has been motor performance driven so far. Deficits in somatosensation in people with CAI Proprioceptive deficits in CAI have been the main focus of research for decades. Thompsons et al. (2018) indicated that there was moderate evidence supporting both active and passive proprioception deficits in CAI as compared with controls. According to the latest systematic review and meta-analysis by Xue et al. (2021), CAI-affected ankles had poorer ankle kinesthesia in both inversion and plantarflexion when compared with the contralateral side; and individuals with CAI showed kinesthesia defects and active joint reposition deficits in the frontal plane movement (both inversion and eversion) when compared to the healthy controls. Not until recent years that more attention has been drawn to deficits in cutaneous sensation. Hoch et al. (2012) found that the plantar surface was less sensitive to vibratory tactile stimulation as compared to non-CAI people at the head of the first metatarsal, the base of the fifth metatarsal, and the heel, along the innervation of the branches of the sural and tibial nerves. Burcal and Wikstrom found similar results that people with CAI displayed higher Semmes Weinstein monofilament thresholds at the head of the first metatarsal, base of the fifth metatarsal, and sinus tarsi31. The possible involvement of impaired cutaneous sensation in CAI have led to the recent approach of sensory-targeted intervention in this population. Deficits in central sensorimotor control in CAI: As described in the previous paragraphs that the classic theory behind the ankle instability has been based on damages of joint receptors and peripheral nerve fibers. However, emerging data has shown that proprioceptive sensory deficits were not enough to explain the neuromuscular deficits in people with CAI, and that more research is needed to determine how CAI influences central sensorimotor control. Previous studies have shown that in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal dysfunction such as shoulder impingement and low back pain, the integration of corticospinal pathways may be affected, presented as higher active motor threshold, longer cortical silent period, reduced cortical mapping area and shifted center of gravity of the cortical mapping area. Possible impairment of the corticospinal control in CAI has recently been examined in a few studies. While Pietrosimone and Gribble (2012), Shih et al. (2017), and Terada et al. (2022) reported that muscles around the ankle joint had impaired corticospinal excitability (reduced motor-evoked potential of the peroneus longus and soleus muscles), the two systemic reviews with meta analysis did not support these findings and showed that people with or without CAI had similar supraspinal neural excitability. These inconsistencies might be related to the differences in study design, such as testing positions and tasks. The role of altered central motor system excitability in CAI has yet to reach agreement; and little was known about the effect of CAI on the somatosensory cortex. Common outcome measures to evaluate somatosensory cortical activation use electroencephalography (EEG) to detect electrophysiological signals of excitatory and inhibitory action potentials in various areas of the cortex. Previous studies reported abnormalities of P27 potentials and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) in people with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficits, indicating somatosensory cortex neuroplasticity following ACL injuries. Only one study has evaluated the somatosensory cortical activation in people with ankle instability, and found no difference in somatosensory cortical activity (event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the upper alpha frequency) between healthy controls and individuals with unstable ankles. With strong evidence showing connections between central sensorimotor deficits and chronic musculoskeletal problems such as low back pain and ACL deficits, we believe that future research is required to understand the role of sensory deficits, particularly the central somatosensory activation in people with CAI and to provide further explanation for the neurophysiological mechanisms for ankle instability. Restoration of motor performance has been the popular intervention for CAI: From the above review, it is obvious that problems behind chronic ankle instability relate to both sensory and motor systems. However, the majorities of intervention strategies have focused on restoring the defects in motor pathways, including muscle strengthening, neuromuscular training, posture and balance control training. Although many of the studies found positive effects of these motor restoration interventions, the synthesis of evidence only supported partially (limited to moderate level) for the effectiveness of neuromuscular or balance training on muscle performance, postural stability or self-perceived improvement. Emerging evidence showing effectiveness of sensory-orientated intervention for CAI: With more understanding on the involvement of sensory deficits in CAI, some researchers started to describe intervention methods using primarily sensory inputs, such as planar massage, and joint mobilization. Joint mobilization was found to improve dynamic posture performance including landing kinematics, reaching distances of the Y balance test, ankle mobility, and self-perceived dysfunction questionnaires. Although joint mobilization was proposed to have the effect of ""resetting the sensorimotor control"", the spinal-reflex and corticospinal excitability of the soleus and peroneus longus were not altered after one session of joint mobilization. In addition, joint mobilization not only provides sensory stimulation but also offers alignment correction for people with CAI. The effectiveness of joint mobilization could have come from improvement in ankle mobility rather than sensory intervention. Several studies have investigated the effect of pure sensory inputs, the plantar massage, in people with CAI and found that plantar massage effectively improved static postural control. However, these studies only measured perceived dysfunction, or functional performance. No neurophysiological mechanism of sensory intervention in CAI has been explored before. Electrical stimulation as a form of treatment for CAI: Traditionally, neuromuscular stimulation has been used as a form of treatment for various conditions, from peripheral nerve injuries, conditions involving arthrogenic inhibition such as ACL insufficiency or patellofemoral pain, to neurological conditions including stroke or spinal cord injury. A great body of evidence has shown that neuromuscular stimulation is effective in restoring motor functions in these conditions. Another approach of electrical stimulation is to use sensory level of stimulation in attempt to improve sensorimotor control. The rationale is that somatosensory stimulation would enhance cortical plasticity in people post stroke. Pan et al. recruited 12 patients post stroke and assessed the effect of 40 minutes of sensory electrical stimulation, combined with hand rehabilitation program. The changes in sensorimotor control were evaluated using corticomuscular coherence (CMC). After 4 weeks of treatment, the CMC value of the electrical stimulation group is higher than that of the control group, indicating that the cerebral motor cortex and the corresponding muscles have a greater and physiologically meaningful functional connection. Although people with CAI has been found to have benefited from sensory intervention such as plantar massage, no neurophysiological mechanism has been studied. In addition, application of sensory transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) is a relatively risk-free and easy-to-implement modality for rehabilitation. However, no study has investigated the effect and treatment mechanisms of TENS in people with CAI. Research gap and contribution of the study: Current research evidence supported that people with chronic ankle instability have deficits in peripheral sensorimotor systems and central motor impairments, resulting in defects in sensorimotor control and functional performance. However, little was known about how CAI affects the somatosensory cortical activation. The effects of strength training, neuromuscular control training, posture/balance training has been widely investigated for CAI, and positive effects on neuromuscular control, corticospinal excitability, and functional performance have been found for this group of people. Recently, sensory intervention for CAI has been proposed and its treatment effect on static and dynamic posture control as well as functions were reported. Based on the effectiveness of sensory intervention and posture adaptation strategies shown in individuals with CAI, it is reasonable to speculate that central somatosensory processing might have a role in altered neuromuscular performance and recovery (sensory intervention effect) of CAI. However, these neurophysiological mechanisms have never been studied before. To address the above issues, we would like to apply for a three-year grant to firstly investigate the effect of CAI on somatosensory cortical activation, corticomuscular coherence, proprioception, cutaneous sensation of the plantar surfaces, and neuromuscular performance. These variables will be compared between 45 young active adults with CAI and 15 controls for the first year study. Secondly, those with CAI will be randomized into three groups, the sensory stimulation group, the sham stimulation group, and the control group. The participants will receive 40 minutes of sensory level of electrical stimulation or sham stimulation or nothing, and the immediate effect will be examined to understand the effect of sensory-level stimulation on neurophysiological mechanisms and neuromuscular performance. Afterwards, the intervention (sensory stimulation with exercise, sham stimulation with exercise, and exercise alone) will be carried out for 5 sessions in two weeks, and the short term intervention effect of additional sensory stimulation will be assessed. The results of this study will provide a better understanding for sensorimotor control in CAI, and for the effect of sensory stimulation intervention in the population with CAI. The data from this investigation will provide clinicians, trainers, and researchers an excellent basis for the management and injury prevention of CAI among athletes, and for further research in this field of study.",Embase,,

In this study, the quadruple hamstring tendon (semitendinosus and gracilis) was measured in a sample of Iraqi adult males. The study enrolled 300 Iraqi men who underwent anterior cruciate ligament repair at Diwaniyah Teaching Hospital and Alforat Alawast Private Hospital between January 2020 and December 2021. The repair procedure was based on the utilization of the quadruple (gracilis and semitendinosus) hamstring tendon. The primary outcome measure was the size of the tendon, determined using a sizing tube calibrated to 0.5 mm. Out of the sample, 80% of patients had a graft diameter of 7.5 mm, while 15% had a graft diameter of 8 mm, and 5% had a diameter of 7 mm. Body mass index was a poor predictor of graft size, whereas patient height was an excellent predictor of graft diameter. The graft diameter in most Iraqi subjects with anterior cruciate ligament injuries needs to be five bands or even six bands; otherwise, other graft sources like bone-patellar-bone or peroneus longus tendon grafts should be considered. The graft diameter may be reliably anticipated based on the patient's height.",Embase,10.25122/jml-2023-0071,

(2023),2023,Platelet-Derived Exosomes Alleviate Knee Osteoarthritis by Attenuating Cartilage Degeneration and Subchondral Bone Loss,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic degenerative joint disease among the aged population. However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1? stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. RESULTS: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study illustrated that the administered Plt-exos could alleviate knee OA by attenuating cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss, possibly serving as a novel promising treatment for OA in the future.",Embase,10.1177/03635465231188122,

Recently, (PLT) is gaining popularity as a graft option in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgeries with biomechanical studies showing tensile strength and clinical outcomes comparable to quadrupled hamstring grafts. In addition to using PLT for isolated (ACL), it is also used in posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction, medial collateral ligament reconstruction, posterolateral corner reconstruction of the knee, or knee multiple ligament injuries . The partial-thickness of the tendon has been used variably in knee ligament surgery.. Being a powerful muscle in plantar flexion and eversion of the foot, there might be associated ankle functional impairment.

(2023),2023,Preoperative ultrasound can accurately predict the diameter of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon autografts,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the correlation between the intraoperative diameter of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon (2PLT) and length of the PLT autograft and preoperative ultrasound (US) measurements, as well as radiographic and anthropometric measurements. The hypothesis was that US can accurately predict the diameter of 2PLT autografts during operation. METHODS: Twenty-six patients underwent ligament reconstruction with 2PLT autografts were included. Preoperative US was used to calculate the in situ PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) at seven levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 cm proximal to the harvest start point). Femoral width, notch width, notch height, maximum patellar length, and patellar tendon length were determined on preoperative radiographs. Intraoperative measurements of PLT were made, including all fiber lengths of PLT and diameters of 2PLT using sizing tubes calibrated to 0.5 mm. RESULTS: CSA at 1 cm proximal to the harvest site had the highest correlation with the diameter of 2PLT (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Calf length had the highest correlation with PLT length (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The diameter of the 2PLT autografts could be predicted by the following formula: 4.6 + 0.2 ? [sonographic CSA of PLT at 1 cm level]; the length of PLT could be predicted by the following formula: 5.6 + 0.5 ? Calf length. CONCLUSION: The diameter of 2PLT and length of PLT autografts can be accurately predicted by preoperative US and calf length measurements, respectively. Accurate preoperative prediction of the diameter and length of autologous grafts can provide the most suitable and individualized graft for patients.IV.",Embase,10.1007/s00167-023-07406-y,
234,EM-90,Chaudhari & Desai (2023),2023,A study of use of Peroneus Longus as graft in primary ACL reconstruction as an alternative in non-athletic patients,"The ACL is one of the most common knee ligament injury due to it being one of the primary stabilizers and has a big importance in knee biomechanics. ACL injuries are commonly associated with sports injuries and road traffic accidents. The primary aim of ACL reconstruction is to restore the function of the ACL and native kinematics of the knee.1 ACL reconstruction restores the stability of the knee joint and protects the menisci and joint surfaces from further damage.2Hamstrings have been one of the most preferred graft tissues for ACL reconstruction for quite a long time. However, in view of simplicity of the technique the preference of peroneus tendon graft isincreasing. Peroneus longus and Brevis have synergistic action which allows for the harvest of peroneus longus tendon. Some studies suggest that peroneus brevis is a more effective evertor than peroneus longus, justifying harvest of peroneus longus tendon.3Our Studyassessed results of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus graft in 38 patients using Lysholmscore and donor site morbidity of foot and ankle after tendon harvesting using AOFAS (American orthopaedic foot and ankle score) and FADI (Foot and Ankle Disability Index) score.1 Peroneus longus tendon has shown that it is one of the most promising autograft for ACL reconstruction with advantage of simple harvesting technique, larger graft diameter and minimal graft complications.",Embase,,

However, clinical data on graft size are limited. PURPOSE: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 ñ 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 ñ 0.7 cm for the ST (P < .05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 ñ 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 ñ 0.7 mm for the ST (P < .05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P < .01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P < .01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P > .05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P < .05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P > .05). CONCLUSION: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length. However, predicting graft diameter based on thigh or shank circumference was more challenging, with higher BMIs affecting the ability to predict ST more than AHPLT.",Embase,10.1177/03635465231165297,
237,EM-93,Hossain et al. (2023),2023,A prospective study of arthroscopic primary ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft: Experience of 439 cases,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are frequent ligamentous injuries that necessitate reconstruction in many cases. The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P <.001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. The peroneus longus tendon can be considered a safe, effective, and promising graft of choice for arthroscopic primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction because it has a good functional outcome and impressive donor ankle function after surgery.",Embase,10.1097/MD.0000000000032943,
238,EM-94,Sahoo & Sahu (2023),2023,Analysis of Postural Control following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Ipsilateral Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"Introduction: Harvesting peroneus longus for ACL reconstruction is thought to create ankle instability which could add to postural instability from an ACL injury. This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. Materials and methods: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three-and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. Results: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals. Conclusion: The static and dynamic balance, which is impaired after ACL injury, improves with ACL reconstruction with PLT autologous graft. Hence PLTG can be safely used as a graft for ACL reconstruction without affecting postural control and body balance.",Embase,10.5704/MOJ.2303.016,
239,EM-95,Ashton et al. (2023),2023,"Challenging the Perceptions of Human Tendon Allografts: Influence of Donor Age, Sex, Height, and Tendon on Biomechanical Properties","BACKGROUND: The use of allograft tendons has increased for primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but allograft supply is currently limited to a narrow range of tendons and donors up to the age of 65 years. Expanding the range of donors and tendons could help offset an increasing clinical demand. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of donor age, sex, height, and specific tendon on the mechanical properties of a range of human lower leg tendons. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Nine tendons were retrieved from 39 fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs (35 donors [13 female, 22 male]; age, 49-99 years; height, 57-85 inches [145-216 cm]) including: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior and anterior, fibularis longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, and flexor digitorum longus. Tendons underwent tensile loading to failure measuring cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum load, strain at failure, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus. Results from 332 tendons were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for donor age, sex, height, and weight. RESULTS: Mechanical properties were significantly different among tendons and were substantially greater than the effects of donor characteristics. Significant effects of donor sex, age, and height were limited to specific tendons: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior, and tibialis anterior. All other tendons were unaffected. The Achilles tendon was most influenced by donor variables: greater CSA in men (? = 15.45 mm2; ?id k adjusted P < .0001), decreased maximum load with each year of increased age (? = -17.20 N per year; adjusted P = .0253), and increased CSA (? = 1.92 mm2 per inch; adjusted P < .0001) and maximum load (? = 86.40 N per inch; adjusted P < .0001) with each inch of increased height. CONCLUSION: Mechanical properties vary significantly across different human tendons. The effects of donor age, sex, and height are relatively small, are limited to specific tendons, and affect different tendons uniquely. The findings indicate that age negatively affected only the Achilles tendon (maximum load) and challenge the exclusion of donors aged >65 years across all tendon grafts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings support including a broader range of tendons for use as allografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and reviewing the current exclusion criterion of donors aged >65 years.",Embase,10.1177/03635465221143385,
240,EM-96,Lubis (2023),2023,Holy Grail of ACL Reconstruction Grafts,"Selection of the appropriate graft for ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction is very important. The right choice of graft will determine the success of the surgery. For professional athletes, the primary choice remains the bone patellar tendon graft. However, sometimes there are complaints of anterior knee pain. The patellar tendon bone remains the strongest graft source for ACL reconstruction. Currently, the most popular graft used is the hamstring tendon, which consists of the semitendinosus and gracillis. The small incision makes this tendon very popular in reconstructive surgery. However, it is not uncommon for the acquired hamstring tendon size to be unpredictable and sometimes too small. The quadriceps tendon is also a good tendon of choice in the ACL reconstruction surgery. Several studies have shown the results of reconstruction with a balanced force with the patellar tendon bone. The portion of bone obtained from the superior pole of the patella, allows bone-to-bone healing. Currently, several surgeons use the peroneus longus tendon as an alternative graft option in ACL reconstructive surgery. The small incision and the relatively easy process of taking the graft, make more and more surgeons interested in using it. However, the use of the peroneus tendon should be reserved in cases of multiple ligament injury or revision cases. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects on the involved ankle. In many countries, allografts can also be used for ACL reconstruction surgery. Its preparation requires strict conditions, so that the graft condition remains good when used.",Embase,10.1177/2325967121S00839,

ACL reconstruction is the current gold standard to restore functional of the knee. Graft selection is important for satisfactory outcomes. Currently, most used autograft are hamstring tendon (HT) and bone patellar tendon bone (BPTB) grafts. This study aims to thoroughly evaluate and review an alternative autograft for ACL reconstruction, which is peroneus longus tendon (PLT). Method: Systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. Literature was searched through PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane Library using Boolean operators. This study included original articles reporting on (1) clinical studies of ACL reconstruction (single-bundle or double-bundle) using PLT autograft (anterior-half, posterior half, or full-thickness); and (2) studies directly comparing outcomes of PLT versus HT. All procedures were primary ligament reconstructions performed for symptomatic acute or chronic ACL injury, with or without meniscal injury. The outcomes assessed included clinical and functional outcome, namely IKDC score, AOFAS scale and FADI. Results: From 247 studies obtained, after full-text review, 4 studies met all eligibility criteria. A total of 259 patients were included in this study. No significant differences was found in IKDC score (p = 0.99) and FADI score (p = 0.11) but significant differences was found in the mean of AOFAS score in favor of HT autograft (p = 0.03).

(2023),2023,Full-thickness peroneus longus tendon autograft for anterior cruciate reconstruction in multi-ligament injury and revision cases: outcomes and donor site morbidity,"Purpose: Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft has been successfully used for isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction cases. Being a powerful evertor and flexor of great toe, there might be associated ankle morbidity with this autograft option. However, there are only a few studies exploring whether the ankle morbidity is significant or not. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes, donor site morbidity, and ankle strength after harvesting ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction in revision ACL and multi-ligament injury cases. Methods: This was a prospective case series. All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. Results: Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22?31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5?8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p = < 0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p = 0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.19), eversion strength(p = 0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p = 0.52), and AOFAS score(p = 0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients. Conclusions: Peroneus longus autograft can be considered as a potential autograft option for ACL reconstruction in multi-ligament knee injuries and revision ACL reconstruction. No significant donor site morbidity was noted at follow-up. Level of evidence: Level IV.",Embase,10.1007/s00590-021-03145-3,

Recently, the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concurrent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstructed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19ñ8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values.

245,EM-101,Reddy et al. (2023),2023,Functional Outcome Between Peroneus Longus Vs Hamstring Graft in an ACL Reconstruction,"Background: The objective of this study was to determine whether there is any significant difference between the functional outcome of the knee using a hamstring (HS) graft and peroneus longus (PL) tendon graft after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Knee stability is mainly provided by ligaments and involves the cruciate ligaments. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament are the most important ones. ACL plays an important role in stabilizing knee joints against translational and rotational forces. ACL tear may lead to knee instability, meniscus tear, and subsequent osteoarthritis. Materials and Methods: All adults aged 16-50 years of either gender presenting with symptoms of symptomatic ACL tear were admitted for arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR and allocated into two groups (peroneus longus and hamstring tendon). Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm score), clinical knee evaluation (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift test), donor site morbidity (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score (AOFAS)), and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively and at six months and one year postoperatively. The same post-op rehabilitation protocol was followed in both groups. Result: Patient was followed at 6 weeks, 3 and 6-months post operatively for clinical and radiological evaluation and results at end of 6 months were calculated by using IKDC and Lysholm knee score. The functional and radiological outcome is similar in both groups. In our study, 50 patients of ACL injury were operated. There were 25 (50%) patients in Group H (Hamstring tendon graft) and 25 (50%) patients in Group P (Peroneus Longus tendon graft). The mean age of patients in Group-H was 35.15 ñ 11.19 years (range 20-54 years) and in Group-P, it was 33.95 ñ 8.99 years (range 19-42 years). In both groups, males predominated in terms of gender (72% in group H and 80% in group P). In Group-H, most of the patients had left side involvement and in Group-P, most of the patients had right side involvement. The mean height in Group-H was 169.00 ñ 9.07 cm and in Group-P, it was 168.99 ñ 7.58 cm. The mean weight in Group-H was 65.45 ñ 8.60 kg and in Group-P, it was 67.29 ñ 8.38 kg. In both groups, majority of patients sustained injury due to road traffic accident, and sports related injuries were relatively less in our study. The average graft diameter of Group H was 10.5 ñ 0.52 mm and that of Group P was 10.6 ñ 0.39 mm. Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint.",Embase,,

Some studies have reported that the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has sufficient length and strength. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the PLT can be used as a novel appropriate material for PCL reconstruction therapy. Materials and methods: Herein, we systematically analysed the clinical effect of the double-stranded PLT and the four-stranded hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the PCL and compared the effectiveness and safety of these two surgical approaches in the reconstruction of PCL injury. A total of 48 patients with complete rupture of the PCL were divided into Group A (reconstructed with the double-stranded PLT, 25 cases) and Group B (reconstructed with the four-stranded hamstring tendon, 23 cases). Results: The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The intraoperative time for tendon extraction was significantly shorter in Group A than Group B. Twenty-four months after operation, patients in the two groups showed the alleviated tibial posterior displacement and the increased IKDC score, Lysholm score and Tegner score. Nevertheless, these scores showed no significant differences between the two groups. Additionally, compared with the therapy using the four-stranded hamstring tendon, therapy using the double-stranded PLT is simpler and safer. Discussion: Both surgical methods are effective in the treatment of PCL injury. The PLT could be a good choice for PCL injury reconstruction material, especially when the four-stranded hamstring tendon is accidentally damaged or ineffective. Our study may provide guidance for the clinical treatment of PCL injury. Level of Evidence: III, retrospective study.",Embase,10.1016/j.otsr.2022.103336,

At terminal follow-up, stability was checked clinically by Lachman test, residual morbidity of donor site was assessed using foot and ankle disability index, and radiographic correlation was done with magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The mean diameter of the graft after tripling was 9 ñ 0.71 mm and the average length before tripling was found to be 27.07 ñ 2.76 cms. At terminal follow-up, 101 patients showed excellent, while 12 patients showed good outcomes. The mean foot and ankle disability index was 94.8 ñ 3. 90.27% of patients had no laxity on clinical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging of all the patients at terminal follow-up showed good graft uptake.

249,EM-105,,2022,All-Inside Single-Bundle for ACL Reconstruction With Full Thickness of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Compared to the Six-strand-hamstring Autograft,"Brief Summary Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is the current gold standard for restoring knee stability. Hamstring tendon (HT) autograft is the most popular graft choice for ACL reconstruction worldwide. Other autografts include bone-patellar tendon-bone and quadriceps tendon, yet no globally accepted gold standard of graft choice exists for use in ACL reconstruction. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been reported as an autograft choice for ligament reconstruction\[2\], but there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes using the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) compared with hamstring tendon autograft. Therefore, we are interested in investigating whether the clinical outcomes of the PLT autograft were equivalent to the Six-strand- hamstring tendon autograft. Detailed Description prospective randomized clinical study to compare the results of all-inside anatomical ACL reconstruction using the AHPLT and using Six-strand- tendon autograft. Randomization will be done with inclusion criteria of primary ACL rupture in adult patients and exclusion criteria of serious osteoarthritis, revision cases, and multiple ligament injuries. Preoperatively, physical examinations including the anterior drawer test and the pivot shift Test were performed to judge the stability of the knee joint. All of the patients will be evaluated with an International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and an American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS).a knee joint arthrometers was also used with knee flexion of 30ø at 134 N. All of the tests will be performed three times by another experienced orthopedic surgeon who is not involved in the surgery, and the mean of the three measurements will be taken as the final value.",Embase,,
250,EM-106,Pelock et al. (2022),2022,Decreasing Wastage of Low Titer Group O Whole Blood,"Background/Case Studies: Our hospital is a large Midwest metropolitan level 1 trauma center that started using Low Titer Group O Whole Blood (LTOWB) for trauma patients as a 3 month trial in May 2019, and then implemented as routine process. Criteria for use was established to have 4 units of LTOWB as the 1st cycle of the Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) for trauma patients that were male or females >50 years old. This would mimic the routine MTP cycle of 4 Red Blood Cells (RBCs), 4 Thawed Plasma (TP) and 1 apheresis platelet (PLT). Originally Leukocyte Reduced (LR) LTOWB was not available so there were concerns about having the whole blood packed into Non-LR RBCs as our general inventory is 100% LR. Initially, the LTOWB was to be discarded if not transfused. LTOWB required an established standing order, which became 4 units delivered every 2 weeks. When reviewing the trial data, the biggest concern was the amount of wastage seen due to discarding the non-LR LTOWB. Study Design/Methods: Routine use of LTOWB was implemented and wastage continued to be monitored. There was an interruption due to a change in blood supplier but now the LTOWB were available as LR, which allowed the possibility of have LR packed RBCs rather than discard of the LTOWB. Data was collected for a year prior to implementing the packing of the WB and then a year post implementation. In addition, the LTOWB standing order was moved from 4 units every 2 weeks to 4 units every week. Results/Findings: A total of 38 LTOWB were discarded prior to implementing the packing of WB due to the units being non-LR. Average unit cost for the non-LR LTOWB was $500 a unit so $19,000 worth of product was discarded. Moving to LR LTOWB and implementing the packing of WB units saved 135 units over 12 months. LR LTOWB average cost was higher at $550 per unit but because the new process allowed RBC units to be used there was a savings of $74,800 for the 12-month period. Conclusion: Two changes helped dramatically decrease the wastage associated with LTOWB. (1) Changing blood suppliers, which allowed LR LTOWB to be received and (2) Implementing the packing of WB to RBCs and recovered plasma. Both changes have allowed us to continue to supply the LTOWB that the trauma team wanted without having excess wastage of an in demand blood product and the associated costs.",Embase,10.1111/trf.17058,
251,EM-107,Chalidis et al. (2022),2022,Graft choices for anterolateral ligament knee reconstruction surgery: Current concepts,"The anterolateral ligament (ALL) is a primary structure of the anterolateral complex of the knee that contributes to internal rotational stability of the joint. Injury of the ALL is commonly associated with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. If left untreated, ALL lesions may lead to residual anterolateral rotational instability of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which is a common cause of anterior cruciate ligament graft failure. The function of the ALL can be restored by lateral extraarticular tenodesis or anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR). In the lateral extraarticular tenodesis procedure, a strip of the iliotibial band is placed in a non-anatomical position to restrain the internal rotation of the tibia, while in ALLR, a free graft is fixed at the insertion points of the native ALL. Gracilis and semitendinosus grafts have mainly been utilized for ALLR, but other autografts have also been suggested. Furthermore, allografts and synthetic grafts have been applied to minimize donor-site morbidity and maximize the size and strength of the graft. Nevertheless, there has been no strong evidence to fully support one method over another thus far. The present review presents a detailed description of the graft choices for ALLR and the current literature available in regard to the effectiveness and outcomes of published surgical techniques.",Embase,10.12998/wjcc.v10.i24.8463,

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. Results: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24?31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P<0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. Conclusion: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be an appropriate autograft for ACLR due to its strength, larger graft diameter, and avoiding potential complications of hamstring autograft obtained from the knee region.",Embase,10.22038/ABJS.2022.59568.2938,

(2022),2022,ACL Reconstructed Knees Had Significantly Higher MR T1? and T2 Values in Cartilage but not in Meniscus Compared to Contralateral Knees at 10 Years after ACL Reconstruction,"Objectives: Patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are at high risk for the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), despite ACL reconstruction (ACLR). ACL injuries are frequently associated with damage of other structures within the knee, such as the meniscus. The meniscus is an important structure that provides protection for articular cartilage and stabilization of the joint. Long-term studies of PTOA after ACLR mainly used radiographs. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used in a limited number of studies to evaluate structural damages, but this only provides information on morphologic changes that occur at relatively late stages of the disease. In this study, we aim to use quantitative MRI (qMRI) to evaluate cartilage and meniscus degeneration in patients at 10 years after ACLR. Methods: This is a multi-site multi-vendor study that involves three sites and two MR platforms (Siemens 3T and Philips 3T). MRI protocols have been harmonized between sites and cross validation data were collected using phantoms. The patients are from a nested cohort within Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Onsite Cohort at 10 years after ACLR. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were: 22-50 years old; ACL tear during a sport; no previous knee injury; no graft rupture during follow-up. In this preliminary report, 51 patients (age 32.8 ñ 6.4 years; 25 females; body mass index [BMI] 25.7 ñ 5.7 kg/m2; 40 hamstring autograft, 9 bone-patellar tendonbone autograft, and 2 allograft) and 17 healthy control participants (age 30.8 ñ 7.8 years; 10 females; BMI 23.8 ñ 5.6 kg/m2) were studied. The MRI protocol included high-resolution Dual-Echo Steady State (DESS), and combined gradient echo MAPSS T1? and T2 mapping. Cartilage and meniscus were automatically segmented on DESS images using an in-house developed deeplearning model into medial/lateral femoral condyle (MFC/LFC), medial/lateral tibia (MT/LT), trochlear (TRO), and patellar cartilage (PAT), and medial and lateral menisci (MM/LM). Each cartilage compartment was further divided into sub-regions based on a modified MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) definition: central and posterior for MFC/LMC (cMFC/cLMC, pMFC/pLMC); anterior, central, and posterior for MT/LT (aMT/aLT, cMT/cLT, pMT/pLT); medial, central, and lateral for PAT/TRO (mPAT/mTRO, cPAT/cTRO, lPAT/lTRO). Menisci were further divided into anterior horn (aMM, aLM), central (body) (cMM, cLM), and posterior horn (pMM, pLM) subregions. These cartilage and menisci subregions were then transformed and overlaid onto the T1? and T2 parameter maps after co-registering the DESS image to the first echo of the 3D MAPSS sequence using the Elastix toolbox. T1? and T2 parameter maps were obtained by a voxel-wise two-parameter monoexponential fitting. The mean and standard deviation for each subregion was recorded and compared between three knee groups: operated and contralateral knees from patients, and control knees from healthy controls, using a mixed-effects regression model, adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Results: For cartilage, compared to contralateral knees, operated knees in patients had significantly higher T1? and T2 values in MFC, MT, and TRO compartments. Looking into subcompartments, for MFC, MT, and TRO, most of the subcompartments (cMFC, pMFC; cMT, pMT; mTRO, cTRO) showed significantly higher T1? and T2 values compared to contralateral knees. For LFC and LT, only the posterior subcompartments showed significantly higher T1? and T2 values compared to contralateral knees. For PAT, no significant differences were observed between operated and contralateral knees. Compared to healthy control knees, operated knees in patients had significantly higher T1? and T2 values in all the six compartments. Besides, contralateral knees also showed higher T1? and T2 values in LFC, LT and PAT compartments compared to healthy control knees (Figure 1 for T1?, T2 with similar trend was not shown). For meniscus, no significant differences in T1? and T2 values were observed between injured and contralateral knees. Compared to healthy control knees, both operated and contralateral knees in patients had significantly higher T1? values in LM and significantly higher T2 values in MM (Figure 2). Conclusions: Cartilage T1? and T2 values were higher in operated knees compared to contralateral knees at 10 years after ACLR, except for patellar compartment. In patellar cartilage, no significant differences were observed between sides in patients, but both sides were significantly higher than control knees. Our data showed that contralateral knees after ACLR may not represent 'healthy controls' as there might be compensatory changes and early degeneration in contralateral knees as a result of injury and surgery to their other knee. Although we observed this general trend of higher cartilage T1? and T2 values in the operated knees compared to contralateral knees, no significant differences were observed in meniscus T1? and T2 values between sides in patients, suggesting the timing of cartilage and meniscus degeneration may be different for patients after ACLR. Meniscus T1? and T2 values in both sides are higher than control knees, suggesting early degeneration in meniscus in patients in both sides. The results will be confirmed with more patient data being collected in the ongoing study. The relationship between qMRI, morphological tissue changes, and patient-reported outcomes after ACLR will also be evaluated in future work. (Figure Presented).",Embase,10.1177/2325967121S00565,
256,EM-112,Vijay et al. (2022),2022,Is Peroneus longus autograft a better alternative to the Hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction? ƒ?? A randomised control study,"Purpose: The anterior cruciate ligament in the knee is commonly prone to injuries. Reconstruction of this ligament with hamstring tendon has been time-tested but peroneus longus autograft is also gaining popularity. However, very limited literature is available comparing the two grafts. This study aims to compare the functional outcome and donor site morbidity between hamstrings and peroneus longus autograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: A prospective randomised study was conducted on 45 patients, who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were assigned into Hamstring group and the Peroneus longus group. Functional outcome was assessed using Lysholm score and Modified Cincinnati scores for the knee joint and American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Scoring for ankle joint. Donor site morbidity was assessed by measuring flexion and extension strength of the knee and plantar flexion and eversion strength of the ankle by handheld dynamometer preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and 1 year follow up. Results: Functional outcome of the knee showed significant improvement in peroneus longus group (p-value 0.002) compared to hamstring group. Even though there was minimal reduction in functional outcome of the ankle at 6 months follow-up in peroneus longus group, it improved at one year follow-up. While assessing the donor site morbidity at the knee joint, knee flexion strength showed improvement in the group (p-value 0.02) but reduced in the hamstring group where the hamstring tendon was harvested. Knee extension strength in the hamstring group scored marginally better than the peroneus longus group, which was not statistically significant (p-value 0.5). Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint.",Embase,10.1177/22104917221088335,

Knee stability, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and Tegner activity level were collected. Results: There was no clinical significance regarding physical examination. Postoperative IKDC score was higher in the hamstring group compared with AHPLT group. Multiple regression analysis was done. The parsimonious model revealed graft types and gender were the most optimal variables explained postoperative IKDC score.

Purpose: To investigate the effect of sectioning the ACL and posterolateral knee structures on lateral compartment gapping under varus stress. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fourteen nonpaired cadaveric knees were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: sequential sectioning of the ACL, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) (ACL-first group) or sequential sectioning of the FCL, PLT, PFL, and ACL (FCL-first group). Knees were loaded onto a custom jig at a 20ø flexion angle. A standardized 12-Núm varus moment was applied to each specimen in the intact state and after each randomized sequential-sectioning state. Lateral compartment opening was measured on radiographs to assess the contribution to the increase in the lateral gap caused by resecting the respective structure. The distance was measured by 3 observers on 15 images (5 testing states each imaged 3 times) per specimen, for a total of 210 radiographs. The articular cartilage surfaces were not included in the measurements. Results: The mean increase in lateral opening after sectioning all structures (ACL and posterolateral corner) was 4.6 ñ 1.8 mm (range, 1.9-7.7 mm). The ACL and FCL sectioning contributed the most to lateral knee opening (1.3 ñ 0.6 and 2.2 ñ 1.3 mm, respectively). In both groups, lateral gapping >3 mm was achieved only after both the ACL and FCL were sectioned. All comparisons of increased mean gapping distances demonstrated a significant difference with subsequent sequential sectioning of structures, except comparisons between the FCL and PLT and the PLT and PFL. When considering the effect of the ACL on lateral opening, no significant difference was found between sectioning the ACL first or FCL first (P =.387). Conclusion: ACL deficiency significantly increased lateral opening under varus stress, regardless of the sequence of injury. The effect of injury to the ACL in addition to the lateral structures should be considered when using varus stress radiographs to evaluate knee injuries. Clinical Relevance: With the current findings, understanding the effect of ACL and posterolateral corner injuries on lateral gapping under varus stress can aid in correctly diagnosing knee injuries and determining appropriate treatment plans.",Embase,10.1177/23259671221100216,

AN OBSERVATIONAL RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS,"Background: Temporal arteritis is the most common systemic vasculitis in patients aged >50 years, the most serious complications of which is visual loss. The arterial biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard; alongside the classic fnding of transmural infltrate and giant cells, other abnormalities have been described, of which it is not yet known whether they identify specifc clinical subsets. PET is not yet used for diagnosis, but it can be suggestive in patients with high clinical suspect; it may be useful for assessing the extention of the disease in already diagnosed patients and for ruling out alternative diagnoses as infections and neoplasms. More recently, PET has been used to assess disease metabolic activity Objectives: The aim of our study is to evaluate, in patients with histologically confrmed temporal arteritis, correlations between pathological subsets, metabolic activity and different clinical behavior. Methods: We have recovered the medical records of patients with the diagnosis of temporal arteritis made in our Rheumatology service from January 2007 until now. We selected those satisfying the ACR 1990 criteria and, fnally, those with a positive biopsy. We analyzed age at onset of symptoms, diagnostic delay, presence of PMR, fever, constitutional symptoms, headache, temporal artery induration, visual loss; we analyzed CRP, ESR, plasmatic Hb, PLT count, hypoco-mplementemia, ANA, aCL, ANCA. The referring pathologist, who didn't know the history of patients, re-examined all the biopsies performed, focusing on: transmural, periadventitial, limited to small vessels or vasa vasorum infltrate, presence of giant cells, macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasmacells, stenosis, thrombosis, fbrinoid necrosis. The nuclear doctor retrieved the PET images by re-assigning each patient the relative PET VAS score. Descriptive analysis was performed: absolute and percentage frequencies were calculated for categorical variables and mean, standard deviation, range and percentiles for quantitative variables. The relationship between variables was tested by the chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney rank test. All analyzes were performed with the STATA software 14.2. Results: We analyzed 46 patients (F 32, M 14), average age at onset of symptoms of 75.5 yrs and average diagnostic delay of 3.2 months. Headache was reported by 37 patients, fever and asthenia by 26 and 24 respectively, jaw claudication and PMR by 18 and 7. 11 patients had visual loss while 4 and 2 respectively reported amaurosis and diplopia. Temporal artery induration was described in 24 patients. Tests of systemic infammation were abnormal (mean CRP 85 mg/L, ESR 72.7 mm/1h); the fnding of hypocomplementemia (1/26 patients), ANA, aCL and ANCA positivity (2/31, 1/27 and 1/25) was negligible. Histological analysis showed the prevalence of transmural infltrate (100% of patients), giant cells (87%) and lymphocytes/macrophages (85% both); small vessel vasculitis (59%) and the presence of plasma cells (53%), neutrophils (48%) and eosino-phils (22%) were less represented. Periadventitial infltrate was described in 29% of patients, with negligibility of vasculitis limited to the adventitia and of the vasa vasorum (2 and 0/46). Intimal hyperplasia and necrosis (22 and 14/46) prevailed over calcifcations, stenosis and thrombosis (7-5-1/46). PET was available in 14 patients including 6 positive (43%), with a median PET VAS score of 7 (range 6-21); 8/13 patients had not taken steroids prior to PET. Conclusion: In our retrospective study we observed, in addition to transmural infltrate and giant cells, the presence of lymphocytes, macrophages and small vessel vasculitis. No correlation was observed between clinical fndings, biological and metabolic activity, apart from the increased presence of giant cells in PET positive patients. Visual loss is slightly more common in PET negative patients. This may be due to severity of the cases which needed early steroid treatment.",Embase,10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-eular.3247,

Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, two authors conducted a systematic review exploring the biomechanical properties of ACL graft sources (querying PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases). Using the keywords ?anterior cruciate ligament graft,? ?biomechanics,? and ?biomechanical testing,? relevant articles of any level of evidence were identified as eligible and included if they reported on the biomechanical properties of skeletally immature or mature ACL grafts solely and if the grafts were studied in vitro, in isolation, and under similar testing conditions. Studies were excluded if performed on both skeletally immature and mature or non-human grafts, or if the grafts were tested after fixation in a cadaveric knee. For each graft, failure load, stiffness, Young's modulus, maximum stress, and maximum strain were recorded. Findings: Twenty-six articles were included. Most studies reported equal or increased biomechanical failure load and stiffness of their tested bone-patellar tendon-bone, hamstring, quadriceps, peroneus longus, tibialis anterior and posterior, Achilles, tensor fascia lata, and iliotibial band grafts compared to the native ACL. All recorded biomechanical properties had similar values between graft types. Interpretation: Most grafts used for ACL reconstruction are biomechanically superior to the native ACL.

(2022),2022,"Determining the Roles of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Posterolateral Corner, and Medial Collateral Ligament in Knee Hyperextension Using the Heel-Height Test","Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are often associated with other ligamentous injuries. The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. Purpose: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-Núm force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P =.863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 ñ 0.83?cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL?posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 ñ 1.02?cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 ñ 1.35?cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P =.154). Conclusion: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state.

Detailed Description Comparison of treatment results - survival and reconstruction of autographs and functional results of the knee joint, and functional results of the ankle joint, obtained in the study groups operated using two methods: A- the use of a long fibular tendon autograft taken from the lower leg of the same limb and used as a graft for ACL reconstruction (anterior cruciate ligament) of the knee joint; B- the use of Hamstring muscle tendon autograft (Semitendonus and slender muscle) taken from the lower leg of the same limb and used as a graft for ACL reconstruction (anterior cruciate ligament) of the knee joint.",Embase,,
264,EM-120,Saki et al. (2022),2022,Female athletes with ligament dominance exhibiting altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns compared to healthy individuals during single-leg landing,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most serious knee injuries and occurs frequently during exercise. Altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns may contribute to dynamic knee valgus and ACL injury mechanisms. Lack of dynamic control of ground reaction force (GRF) is known to be contributing factor for ACL injury by placing excessive force on passive structures. Muscle co-contraction is a dynamic mechanism for GRF absorption. Therefore, any alterations in co-contraction might be a risk factor for ACL injury. Ligament dominance is a term to define individuals who rely more on ACL ligament for GRF control. Research question: This study aimed to compare the muscle co-contraction patterns of distal and proximal knee muscles during single leg landing in female athletes with and without ligament dominance. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 54 female athletes were assigned to the healthy (n = 27) and ligament dominance (n = 27) group based on their Tuck Jump test scores. The electromyography activity of the gluteus medius, adductor longus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured by an electromyography in drop down a 30-cm-high stair. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis (p ó 0.05). Results: The two groups demonstrated an overall significantly different muscle co-contraction patterns (P < 0.05). There was a decreased in co-contraction of proximal group and an increased co-contraction in the distal muscles in ligament dominant group. Significance: The findings have provided evidence to support the notion of neuromuscular imbalances in ligament dominance deficit. These findings can be useful for the coaches and experts to design preventive exercises and modify the current programs for the people affected by ligament dominance.",Embase,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2022.02.011,
265,EM-121,Damiati et al. (2022),2022,"Implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the clinical, hematological, and inflammatory parameters in COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cross-sectional study","Background: The current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is characterized by atypical pneumonia, mild colds, and more severe illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory distress, thrombosis, organ failure, and various secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Notably, the severity of COVID-19 in different age groups is not well known, and the validity of clinical laboratory data remains unclear. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we examined differential regulation of clinical, hematologic, and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. We divided 104 COVID-19 patients into five different groups according to age (0?17, 18?45, 46?65, 66?79, and >80 years). Baseline data (sex, comorbidities, intensive care admission, and medications), hematologic markers, liver, and renal function tests, coagulation, and inflammatory markers were examined in these groups. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal threshold for predicting COVID-19 biological markers. Results: We found that the highest percentage (45%) of COVID-19 patients was in the age group of 46?65 years. The hematologic parameters (WBC, HB, and PLT) were normal between the patient groups. The area under the curve in ROC analysis showed significant differences in the levels of creatine, GGT, BUN, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, AST, and procalcitonin between the patients of age groups 46?65 and 66?79 years. Renal biomarkers were significantly high in most patients, regardless of age. In contrast, the liver biomarkers, did not differ significantly between patient groups. Conclusion: The main finding of our study is that laboratory parameters such as GGT, creatinine, BUN, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin and D-dimer were differentially regulated in COVID -19 patients of different age groups. Importantly, these laboratory parameters may help as clinical predictors to assess the severity of the disease in the population. We conclude here that age is an important factor influencing COVID-19 severity.",Embase,10.1016/j.jiph.2021.12.013,

(2022),2022,Proprioceptive postural control strategies differ among non-injured athletes,"Postural control during complex tasks requires adequate sensory integration and somaesthetic reweighting: suboptimal postural strategies can lead to injury. We assessed the ability of healthy athletes to reweight somaesthetic signals during postural perturbations on different surfaces. Thirty-five young (16 ñ 1 years), healthy, elite handball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Proprioceptive reweighting was evaluated via vibration of the triceps surae and lumbar muscles on firm and foam surfaces. Postural variables and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius (GM), semitendinosus (ST) and fibularis longus (FL) were recorded during the PRE (10 s), VIBRATION (20 s) and POST (20 s) periods. Ankle proprioception was predominantly used on the firm compared to foam support. However, two opposing behaviours were observed: a ?rigid? strategy in which reliance on ankle proprioception increased on the foam, and a ?plastic? strategy that involved a proximal shift of proprioceptive reliance (p < 0.001). The plastic strategy was associated with a more effective recovery of balance after vibration cessation (p < 0.05). ST activation was higher during POST in the rigid strategy and did not return to the PRE level (p < 0.05) whereas it did in the plastic strategy. Proprioceptive strategies for postural control are highly variable and future studies should evaluate their contribution to injury.",Embase,10.1016/j.neulet.2021.136366,

Methodology: A total of 80 cases aged 15 ? 40 years undergoing single-bundle ACL reconstruction fromJanuary 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled. All were randomly assigned to either hamstring tendon group or PLT group. Functional scoring as ?International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)?, ?Modified Cincinnati? and ?Lysholm scores? were noted prior to surgery and at the end of follow-up period of 9-months after surgery. Donor-site morbidity was also assessed. Results: Out of 80 cases, there were 66 (82.5%) were male. Mean age in hamstring group was 27.4 + 9.1 versus 25.8 + 8.6 years in PLT group (p = 0.4214). Thigh circumference between operated and sound leg was significantly high in hamstring group (p < 0.0001). None of the patient in PLT group had any other donor-site morbidity while 6 (16.7%) patients in hamstring group were found to have anterior kneeling pain. Conclusion: Peroneus longus as graft choice in isolated ACL injuries needs further encouragement, as it was found to have less donor-site related morbidities especially among individuals who commonly kneel during their daily activities.",Embase,,
268,EM-124,Phatama et al. (2021),2021,Higher rate of patellofemoral problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring autograft,"BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral problems are not uncommon among post-anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction patients. Hamstring autograft harvesting-related factor is one of the suspected causes. A lack of tibiofemoral internal rotation force due to strength deficit causes the patella tends to shift laterally. AIM: Peroneus longus tendon has been proposed as an alternative graft source due to its adequate tensile strength and minimal donor site morbidity to the knee biomechanics, including the patellofemoral joint. This tendon does not cross the knee joint and thus does not affect patellofemoral alignment and biomechanics. This study aims to compare patellofemoral problems between hamstring and peroneus longus autograft harvested patients following ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one subjects who underwent primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction between September 2018 and September 2019 and met the inclusion criteria were grouped into the hamstring group (n = 16) and peroneus longus group (n = 15). Both groups were evaluated retrospectively. The follow-up assessment was conducted on the phase II rehabilitation program. The assessed variables were pain, crepitus, and the Indonesian-validated Kujala score. RESULTS: No significant differences in pain and crepitus were found between both groups. There were significant differences in the Kujala score between both groups (p < 0.001). The peroneus longus group reported an averagely higher score than the hamstring group. CONCLUSION: Single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft produces less patellofemoral symptoms and functional limitation than using hamstring tendon autograft.",Embase,10.3889/oamjms.2021.6626,

Methods: A total of 33 patients received allografts for reconstructive knee surgery between 2007 and 2017. The follow up evaluation consisted of a clinical knee examination including evaluation of range of motion (ROM), lateral and medial laxity, the Lachman test, the Pivot shift test, the sag test, the posterior drawer test and checking for patellofemoral pain. The following patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were used; the Lysholm Function Score, the Tegner activity score, and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Results: Twenty-one (64%) patients were available for the follow-up evaluation and the mean follow-up time was 4.8 years. A total of 16 out of 21 patients had multiligament injuries of which the ACL was the ligament most frequently ruptured. At the time of follow-up, 14 out of 16 patients (87%) with ACL injury had Lachman test grade 0 or grade 1 + , and 12 out of 13 (92%) had a pivot shift grade 0 or 1 +. The mean Lysholm Score was 74. All mean KOOS subscale values were ò 59 at the follow-up. The preoperative Tegner activity score was 3 (range, 1?6) and 4 (range, 2?6) at follow up. There were no deep postoperative infections. A total of 19 out of 21 patients (90%) reported that they would have undergone surgery again had they known the clinical outcome in advance. Conclusions: The patients improved from the preoperative score to the follow-up score in the knee-related Quality of Life (QoL) KOOS subscale.

(2021),2021,ACS-STEMI in a young man with triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome: Clinical implications about antithrombotic therapy management,"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by venous and arterial thromboembolic (TE) disease, and/or pregnancy morbidity, associated with persistent elevated antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, LA, anticardiolipin, aCL, and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I, anti-?2GPI). A 51 year-old man, smoker, presented to our ER with chest pain. EKG showed Q waves and STE in the anterior leads, with increased troponin levels. A diagnosis of anterior STEMI was made and he was taken into our catheterization laboratory, where a high burden thrombotic plaque determining LM and ostial LAD subocclusion was treated with PPCI and a DES implantation; in addition, multiple failed PCI attempts were performed on a distal LAD occlusion, and an integrilin bolus was administered. The patient was admitted to our CICU and a DAPT with ASA and Ticagrelor was started. TTE showed LVEF 40%, apical akinesis, septal and anterior hypokinesis, and no significant valve disease. An aPTT abnormal value (100.5 s; reference range 25-38.5 s) was detected, not corrected by aPTT mixing study. Given suspected autoimmune prothrombotic state, normal Hb and PLT values and low bleeding risk, LMWH 100 IU/kg every 12 h was started, in addition to DAPT with switch from Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel. LA and aCL and anti-?2GPI IgG were positive, with negativity of others rheumatologic tests, confirming primary APS diagnosis. Repeat TTE showed EF 50%. The patient was discharged in 'triple therapy' (DAPT plus LMWH), and referred to the rheumatology clinic. LA, aCL, and anti-?2GPI tests 12 weeks later were positive, confirming a triple positive APS and satisfying revised Sapporo criteria. The rheumatologist switched therapy to Clopidogrel plus Warfarin. At 3 months follow-up, the patient, former smoker, was asymptomatic and TTE confirmed EF 50%, so he was recommended to continue with his medical therapy. APS is rarely associated with AMI (?5.5%) and in only 2.8% cases AMI represents the onset of the disease. AMI pathogenesis in APS is considered to be acute thrombosis of coronary arteries, in contrast with atherosclerotic plaque rupture in typical AMI. Key discriminators to identify APS as potential underlying cause of AMI include young age, previous unprovoked thromboses, low platelets count (they are consumed in the thrombotic process), high aPTT value (LA may interfere with assembly of the prothrombinase complex on phospholipids), coronary artery thromboses in the setting of otherwise normal otherwise appearing coronary arteries. APS antibodies have also pro-inflammatory activity on vascular endothelial cells, leading to accelerated atherosclerosis. aGAPSS score (high risk ò10) is useful for risk stratification of recurrent thrombosis and AMI in young patients with APS. The treatment of AMI in APS is therefore a clinical challenge. Strict management of additional CV risk factors is crucial. VKA (INR >3 with Warfarin, INR2-3 with Warfarin and ASA) should be provided for life, because of the very high risk of recurrent TE. DOACs are less effective and less safe than VKAs for TE prevention in APS. The role of coronary stents, considering higher rates of stent thrombosis after PCI in APS patients triple therapy concomitant risks, requires further studies. Due to lack of large, randomized, prospective studies, there is no clear experts consensus about optimal antithrombotic therapy in secondary prevention after arterial TE. APS patients with STEMI should undergo PCI, usually associated with thrombus aspiration, and in selected cases DES implantation in culprit lesion followed by triple antithrombotic therapy with short-term DAPT and long-term VKA.",Embase,10.1093/eurheartj/suab140.047,

(2021),2021,A NOVEL OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE IN HARVESTING PERONEUS LONGUS TENDON FOR ARTHROSCOPIC RECONSTRUCTION IN COMBINED ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT TEARS,"Significant improvements in clinical functional outcome, and preservation of preoperative motor strength of the donor ankle suggest that donor ankle morbidity is prevented. Furthermore, significant improvements in clinical functional outcome and stability of the injured knee makes PLT a suitable graft for PCL in simultaneous ACL-PCL arthroscopic reconstruction. Data Background Recent comparative studies suggest that the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) may be a good alternative autograft in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in terms of strength, efficacy, and safety. However, the presence of several donor ankle morbidities observed postoperatively suggests a possible gap in the operative technique described in current literature. The aim of this study is to describe a surgical technique in harvesting the PLT for arthroscopic reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in patients with combined ACL-PCL tears, thereby decreasing, if not eliminating, the postoperative outcome of donor ankle weakness. Methods In this case series, four patients diagnosed with combined ACL-PCL tears undergo simultaneous arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL and PCL using the ipsilateral hamstring and peroneus longus tendon (PLT) as autografts respectively. After harvesting the PLT, the remaining distal stump of the tendon was sutured on to the peroneus brevis using simple interrupted technique. Functional Foot Index (FFI) was utilised to measure clinical functional outcome of the donor ankle, whereas Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was utilized to measure clinical functional outcome of the injured knee. Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) was used to document motor strength of the donor ankle, and special tests of the knee were performed to assess stability of the injured knee. Results With the longest follow-up period of 3 years, significant and continuous improvements were noted in clinical functional outcomes of the donor ankle and injured knee in all patients who underwent the surgical procedure. Physical examination findings reveal no weakness in first ray plantarflexion and foot eversion of the donor ankle as early as 3 months in the postoperative period. Previously positive findings in the special tests performed on the knee, suggesting the presence of a multi-ligamentous injury, reveal negative findings immediately intraoperatively, as soon as the autografts are secured. Conclusion Suturing the distal stump of the remaining PLT to peroneus brevis is a novel and crucial step in preventing donor ankle morbidity after harvesting the PLT for PCL reconstruction in combined ACL-PCL tears. Significant improvements in clinical functional outcome, and preservation of preoperative motor strength of the donor ankle suggest that donor ankle morbidity is prevented. Furthermore, significant improvements in clinical functional outcome and stability of the injured knee makes PLT a suitable graft for PCL in simultaneous ACL-PCL arthroscopic reconstruction.",Embase,10.1136/jisakos-2021-congress.393,
272,EM-128,G”kler et al. (2021),2021,The effect of sterilization and storage on the viscoelastic properties of human tendon allografts,"Allografts have become increasingly preferred for anterior cruciate ligament replacement purposes. The risk of infections necessitates thorough sterilization procedures, and the allografts usually need to be stored prior to surgery. Classical mechanical tests have been performed with various types of tendons, however, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus tend to suffer the least biomechanical changes after irradiation. Only few results are available of the strain and creep behaviour of tendons, even though this information is necessary to provide suitable allografts. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of different tendon types (T-tibialis anterior, P-peroneus longus), sterilization methods (G-gamma irradiation of 21 kGy, E-electron beam irradiation of 21 kGy) and storage times (5 and 6 months) on the creep behavior, which is characterized by the strain at the end of the loading phase and creep deformation after static loading. Static creep tests were performed with 250 N load during 60 s. Deformation at the end of the loading phase of both tendons was significantly smaller after 5 months long storage than that after 6 months long storage. TE5 showed significantly less creep than group TE6, and TE6 significantly greater than PE6. The creep of TE5 was significantly lower than that of TG5. Based on the data, the peroneus longus sterilized by electron beam and stored deep frozen for 5 months is a better choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than tibialis anterior sterilized by gamma irradiation stored for 6 months.",Embase,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110697,

METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid (MEDICINE), and EMBASE databases were queried for original articles from clinical studies including the keywords: ACL reconstruction and PLT autograft. Studies comparing PLT autograft versus HT autograft were included in this analysis and the following data were extracted from studies meeting the inclusion criteria: graft diameter, functional outcomes (Tegner activity scale, Lysholm score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score), knee laxity (Lachman test), and complications (donor site pain or paresthesia, graft failure). Besides, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) pre-operation and at last follow-up were also compared among patients using PLT autograft. Meta-analysis was applied using Review Manager 5.3 and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies including 925 patients with ACL reconstruction met inclusion criteria. Of these, 5 studies included a direct comparison of PLT autograft (164 patients) versus HT autograft (174 patients). No significant difference was observed between PLT and HT autografts for Tegner activity scale, Lachman test, donor site pain, or graft failure. However, PLT groups demonstrated better Lysholm score (mean difference between PLT and HT groups, 1.55; 95% CI 0.20-2.89; p = 0.02) and IKDC subjective score (mean difference between PLT and HT groups, 3.24; 95% CI 0.29-6.19; p = 0.03). No difference of FADI was found (n.s.) but AOFAS was slightly decreased at last post-operative follow-up for patients with PLT autograft compared with pre-operative scores (mean difference of 0.31, 95% CI 0.07-0.54, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: PLT autograft demonstrated comparable functional outcomes and graft survival rates compared with HT autograft for ACL reconstruction. However, a slight decrease in AOFAS score should be considered during surgical planning. Hence, the PLT is a suitable autograft harvested outside the knee for ACL reconstruction to avoid the complication of quadriceps-hamstring imbalance which can occur when harvesting autografts from the knee.Level II.",Embase,10.1007/s00167-020-06279-9,

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) provides surgical restoration of the injured ACL using the placement of graft material. The choice of graft is principal in providing optimal knee stability after surgery. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is an autograft modality that offers unique benefits for ACL reconstruction cases. Presentation of case: We present a case of ACL reconstruction surgery using PLT graft in a patient with a confirmed ACL rupture. Assessment of post-surgical pain, knee stability, and ankle function were performed to determine functional outcome and donor site morbidity. The follow-up results revealed favorable recovery and improvement in all objective parameters. Discussion: Post-operative biomechanical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) score. The use of PLT in ACL reconstruction established an excellent potential for its satisfactory result and comparable to other graft modalities in widely used evidence-based findings.

Methods: A clinical data of 30 patients with PCL injury, who were admitted between December 2015 and September 2018 and met the selection criteria, was retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon and TightRope technique. Among them, 19 were male and 11 were female, aged 17-48 years (mean, 28.2 years). The PCL injury was caused by traffic accident in 8 cases, sport in 14 cases, falling and bruising by a heavy objective in 5 cases, and other injuries in 3 cases. The interval between injury and operation was 10-90 days (mean, 39.3 days). The PCL injury was rated as grade ? in 6 cases and grade ? in 24 cases. The posterior drawer test was positive in 26 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 24 cases. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 61.37ñ8.49, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was near normal in 2 cases, abnormal in 8 cases, and significantly abnormal in 20 cases. The modified Lysholm knee score was 62.20ñ5.67. The knee range of motion (ROM) was (101.83ñ8.15) ø. Results: The operative time ranged from 70 to 110 minutes (mean, 79.7 minutes). All incisions healed by first intetion. All patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 19.0 months). There were 3 cases of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity after operation, and 1 case of approximately 10ø limitation of knee extension. At last follow-up, the posterior drawer test was positive in 2 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 1 case, with significant differences compared with the preoperative period ( ?2=38.571, P=0.000; ?2=36.274, P=0.000). The IKDC score was 84.67ñ3.67, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was normal in 16 cases, nearly normal in 10 cases, abnormal in 3 cases, and significantly abnormal in 1 case; the modified Lysholm knee score was 90.37ñ4.49; all of the above indexes were significantly better than preoperative ones, and the differences were significant ( t=-12.387, P=0.000; Z=-2.810, P=0.005; t=-22.865, P=0.000). Knee ROM was (88.33ñ9.86)ø at 1 month after operation and reached (113.33ñ13.48)ø at last follow-up, showing significant differences between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05). MRI re-examination showed that the form and position of reconstructed PCL were satisfactory. Conclusion: It can obtain good short-term effectiveness for PCL injuries by arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon, which has the advantages of reliable surgical approach, safe operation, and precise effectiveness.",Embase,10.7507/1002-1892.202011058,

Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as an alternative autograft for reconstruction in kneeling populations and in simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries. Objective To evaluate the current evidence on the outcome of primary ACLR with PLT autograft in adults and donor ankle morbidity, in addition to determining the average PLT graft dimensions from published studies. Evidence review Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and Virtual Health Library databases using the terms ""anterior cruciate ligament,""""peroneus longus""and ""fibularis longus""alone and in combination with Boolean operators AND/OR. Studies evaluating clinical and stability outcomes, graft-donor ankle morbidity and graft dimensions of PLT in ACLR were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (mCMS). A narrative analysis is presented using frequency-weighted means wherever feasible. Publication bias was assessed using the ROBIS tool. Findings Twelve articles with intermediate-level methodological quality were included. Eight studies assessing the clinical and stability outcomes of reconstruction with PLT showed satisfactory outcomes, similar to those of hamstring tendons (HT). No studies assessed anterior knee pain as an outcome. Six studies evaluated the graft-donor ankle morbidity using general functional foot and ankle scores and non-validated tools, showing favourable outcomes. Nine studies assessed PLT graft diameter, revealing grafts consistently larger than 7 mm among the different preparation techniques, which is comparable with reports of HT grafts. Conclusions and relevance The clinical and stability outcomes of ACLR with different PLT autograft preparation techniques are comparable with those of HT during short-term follow-up; however, there is insufficient evidence to support its use in the populations that motivated its implementation. Thus, stronger evidence obtained with the use of validated tools reporting negligible donor-graft ankle morbidity after PLT harvesting is required prior to recommending its routine use, despite the consistency of its dimensions.

279,EM-135,Blanke et al. (2021),2021,Does the anterolateral ligament protect the anterior cruciate ligament in the most common injury mechanisms? A human knee model study,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction still has a risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Thus, extra-articular structures such as the anterolateral ligament (ALL) are increasingly treated. The ALL however prevents the internal rotation of the tibia and it must be doubted that the ALL protects the ACL in other common injury mechanisms which primarily include tibial external rotation. In this study we aimed to evaluate which extra-articular structures support the ACL in excessive tibial internal and external rotation using a knee finite element (FE) model. Methods: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to an FE model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Three additional anatomic structures (anterolateral ligament, popliteal tendon and posterior oblique ligament) were added to the FE model separately and then all together. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. Results: The ACL was the most loaded ligament both in tibial internal and external rotation. The ALL was the main stabilizer of the tibial internal rotation (46%) and prevented the tibial external rotation by only 3%. High forces were only observed in the LCL with tibial external rotation. The ALL reduced the load on the ACL in tibial internal rotation by 21%, in tibial external rotation only by 2%. The POL reduced the load on the ACL by 8%, the PLT by 6% in tibial internal rotation. In tibial external rotation the POL and PLT did not reduce the load on the ACL by more than 1%. Conclusion: The ALL protects the ACL in injury mechanisms with tibial internal rotation but not in mechanisms with tibial external rotation. In injury mechanisms with tibial external rotation other structures that support the ACL need to be considered.",Embase,10.1016/j.knee.2021.02.026,

Methods: Between January 2016 and December 2018, 46 patients with PCL injuries were enrolled. There were 34 males and 12 females, with an average age of 40.7 years (range, 20-58 years). There were 43 cases of acute injury and 3 cases of old injury. The anterior drawer test and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 4 cases, the posterior drawer tests and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 46 cases, the varus stress tests were positive in 10 cases, and the valgus stress tests were positive in 6 cases. The difference of dial-test at 30ø knee flexion between affected and healthy sides was (5.20ñ3.91)ø. The tibia posterior displacement under posterior stress position was (12.03ñ2.38) mm. The Lysholm score of the knee joint was 36.68ñ7.89, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 33.58ñ5.97, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Association (AOFAS) score of the ankle joint was 97.60ñ1.85. PCL was reconstructed with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy, and the combined meniscus injury, posterolateral complex injury, and anterior cruciate ligament injury were all treated according to the degree of injury. Results: All incisions healed by first intention. Forty patients were followed up 12-26 months, with an average of 16.0 months. At last follow-up, the Lysholm score of the knee joint was 84.85ñ7.03, and the IKDC score was 87.13ñ6.27, which were significant different from preoperative ones ( t=-13.45, P=0.00; t= -39.12, P=0.00); the AOFAS score of ankle joint was 93.98ñ2.14, which was not significant different from preoperative one ( t=8.09, P=0.90). The tibia posterior displacement under posterior stress position was (2.75ñ1.76) mm and the difference of dial-test at 30ø knee flexion between affected and healthy sides was (1.75ñ2.09)ø, which were significant different from preoperative ones ( t=29.00, P=0.00; t=4.96, P=0.00). The posterior drawer test and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 1 case and negative in 39 cases; the anterior drawer test and the varus and valgus stress tests were all negative.

The aim of our study was to verify mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT) in alcohol-related liver cirrhosis (ALC) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. One hundred forty-two patients with ALC, 92 with NAFLD, and 68 in control group were enrolled in this study. Hematological indices (MPV, PCT, and PDW) and serological (indirect and direct) markers of liver fibrosis (AAR, APRI, FIB-4, GPR, PICP, PIIINP, TGF-, PDGF-AB, laminin) were measured in each participant. MELD score in ALC patients and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) together with BARD score in the NAFLD group were also obtained. Results were compared between research and control groups. Then, a correlation between evaluated indices was performed in study groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) and area under the curve (AUC) values were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of measured indices. Significant increase in PDW and decrease in PCT in comparison to controls were noted in examined ALC (60.4% vs. 51.2% and 0.1% vs. 0.21%, respectively, p<0.0001) and NAFLD (54.75% vs. 51.2% and 0.19 vs. 0.21%, respectively, p<0.01) patients. Decreased level of MPV was observed in NAFLD group (7.85 fl vs. 8.90 fl, p<0.0001). Additionally, PCT correlated with NFS (p<0.0001). Evaluated PLT indices correlated with MELD score (MPV and PDW, p<0.001; PCT, p<0.05). They correlated with indirect and direct markers of liver fibrosis in the whole research group, too. PCT was the parameter with the greatest diagnostic accuracy in ALC patients (AUC=0,839 for cutoff<0.17%); in NAFLD group, it was MPV (AUC=0,808 for cutoff<7.9 fl). PCT in ALC and MPV in NAFLD can be perceived as potential diagnostic markers.",Embase,10.1155/2021/8867985,

(2021),2021,All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using an Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"Background: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been used as a graft in many orthopaedic surgical procedures because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. Purpose: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30ø of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. Results: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 ñ 0.62 vs 7.0 ñ 2.18 mm, respectively; P <.001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 ñ 8.27, 50.9 ñ 8.50, and 1.8 ñ 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 ñ 2.61, 95.2 ñ 2.64, and 6.8 ñ 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P <.001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively. No complications or reoperations occurred. Conclusion: All-inside ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft produced good functional scores and stability without obvious ankle-site morbidity.",Embase,10.1177/2325967121991226,
284,EM-140,Khan et al. (2021),2021,Prediction of peroneus longus graft diameter for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by inframalleolar harvest and from anthropometric data,"Background: The literature is gradually drifting towards a graft of larger diameter for successful ACL reconstruction. There is no published literature regarding the anthropometric predictors for the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft obtained in ACL reconstruction through the inframalleolar approach. Methods: Fifty-two patients were finally evaluated for anthropometric parameters to predict quadrupled PLT graft diameter in ACL reconstruction using the inframalleolar technique. Intraoperative quadrupled PLT graft diameter was correlated to the patient?s anthropometric data such as age, height, weight, duration of injury, and BMI. We used regression analysis in a stepwise manner to ascertain anthropometric indices associated with the graft diameter. Results: This study included 46 males and six females. Mean age was 28.2 ñ 7.4 years, mean height was 172.7 ñ 2.8 cm, mean weight was 75.6 ñ 3.4 kg, mean BMI was 25.3 ñ 0.9 kg/m2, mean duration of injury was 9.2 ñ 3.9 months, and mean graft diameter was 9.3 ñ 0.4 mm. Positive correlation with graft diameter was found only with height (r = 0.6, P < 0.01) and weight (r = 0.4, P < 0.01). On analysing through linear regression, height and weight had significant association with graft diameter, and we formulated the following prediction equation: PLT graft diameter (mm) = 0.083 ? height (cm) + 0.011 ? weight (kg)-5.854. Conclusion: Patients? characteristics, including height and weight, have a significant correlation with quadrupled PLT graft diameter and the average diameter of graft is > 9 mm through this approach.",Embase,,
285,EM-141,Sahu et al. (2021),2021,Evaluation of donor ankle function after harvesting Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction-A prospective cohort study,"Introduction: Primary full thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft (PLTG) for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) has been used with good clinical outcome. Recently, it is designated as a promising graft option for ACLR. The effect of harvesting PLTG on donor ankle function is still not completely understood. Peroneus Longus Tendon (PLT) is thought to play a major role in proprioceptive regulation of the ankle joint. All the studies till date did cross-sectional assessments of ankle and foot function at or after 6 months that might have overlooked the timely detection of donor site morbidities. Aim: To evaluate the ankle function and compare the affected and sound limb function in subjects with an ACLR with autologous PLTG starting at an early postoperative visit upto six months. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary rehabilitation center from March 2019 to March 2021 including the follow-up evaluation. As per the inclusion criteria, 63 participants after ACLR with PLTG were considered for assessment using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle and hind foot scale and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) scale at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-ACLR follow-up. Comparison between sound and affected limbs was done during all follow-ups. The statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. Both FAAM and AOFAS ankle and foot scores were analysed with non parametric tests. Results: Mean Age of 63 participants were 29.25 years. Median of AOFAS and FAAM score at 6 week, 3 month, and 6 month post-ACLR follow-ups were (88, 98 and 100) and (97.22, 98.80 and 100), respectively. Statistically significant increase in AOFAS and FAAM scores were observed at 3 month and 6 month as compared to 6 week follow-ups with p=0.001 and p-value=0.001 respectively. The group comparison between the affected and sound side functional scores at different study visits showed statistically significant greater values for the sound ankle than the affected ankle (FAAM: 6 week: p-value=0.001; 3 month: p-value=0.001; 6 month: p-value=0.001 and AOFAS p-value=0.001; p-value=0.001; p-value=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The evaluation of functional outcomes showed gradual and linear improvement at subsequent postoperative visits and restores fully to 100% at 6 month indicating a near-normal to normal donor ankle function following ACLR with PLTG by 6 months. The group comparison showed only marginal but significant difference between affected and sound ankle function.",Embase,10.7860/JCDR/2021/49882.15383,

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 ñ 6.73, and 29.6 ñ 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 52 patients (38 males, 14 females; mean age: 29.2ñ7.7 years; range, 17 to 51 years) who received PLT autograft for ACL reconstruction in our center between July 2018 and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics of the patients and leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters were recorded before the operation. The PLT autograft diameter and length were measured during surgery. RESULTS: A statistically significant correlation was found between the graft diameter and length and weight, height, body mass index (BMI), leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters (p<0.01). There was no statistically significant correlation between the graft diameter and length and age (p>0.05). Distal leg diameter had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft diameter (r=0.956), while the height had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft length (r=0.982). CONCLUSION: Anthropometric parameters of height, weight, BMI, leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters may be helpful for surgeons to predict the diameter and length of the PLT autograft before surgery. Distal leg diameter is a particularly important parameter in predicting PLT autograft diameter.",Embase,10.5606/ehc.2021.79580,

A high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in cancer patients often obligates two citrate tube collectionwhen coagulation testing and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) detection are required, being strenuous and tiresome forphlebotomists and patients.Pre-analytical conditions regarding patient circumstances should be evaluated.Objective: Assessment of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) using the same samplefor LA.Material and Methods: Platelet count (PLT), PT and PTT were performed in 80 patients in both plasma and platelet-poorplasma (PPP) using a Beckman Coulter LH750 for PLT, ACL TOP 500 with HemosIL? Recombiplastin 2G for PT, HemosIL?Synthasil for aPTT, HemosIL? dRVVT and HemosIL? SCT for LA.Peripheral blood collection was performed for 2.8% sodium citrate tubes (1/9 sodium citrate vs blood).Plasma was obtained with single centrifugation and PPP with double centrifugation at 1500g for 15 minutes with acentrifuge brake set off.Three groups were created in both plasma and PPP samples: total, positive LA and negative LA.Student's t-test was used for group comparison.Results: No significant statistical differences were obtained for PT or aPTT results on corresponding samples on eithergroup evaluated.PT comparison for total, positive LA and negative LA were =0.4732, =0.7043 and =0.4006 respectively. aPTTcomparison presented =0.1990, =0.2947 and =0.0921 for the same groups.PT presented a minimum and a maximum of 9.8"" and 23.8"" in plasma, and 9.7"" and 23.0"" in PPP. Minimum andmaximum aPTT values were 20.8"", 126.2"" in plasma and 21.5"", 137.0"" in PPP.Platelet counts were evidently different between plasma and PPP samples evaluated (=4.9617 ? 10-12), with aminimum of 5 ? 103/? L, maximum of 296 ? 103/? L in plasma and 1 ? 103/? L, 80 ? 103/? L in PPP samples.Conclusions: Cancer patients face hard physical conditions, hence pre-analytical criteria are crucial in minimizing thenegative impact of blood sampling.No differences were observed for PT and aPTT results between plasma and PPP.This allows the determination of PT and aPTT in PPP when LA evaluation is also required, with benefits for the patientand less sample manipulation by technicians.",Embase,10.1515/cclm-2021-0360,

(2020),2020,An Autograft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Results in Better Biomechanical Performance and Tendon-Bone Incorporation Than Does a Hybrid Graft in a Rat Model,"BACKGROUND: The biomechanical and tendon-bone incorporation properties of allograft-augmented hybrid grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction compared with traditional autografts are unknown. HYPOTHESIS: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction yields better results on biomechanical testing, radiographic analysis, and histological evaluation versus using a hybrid graft. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of 66 adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with an autograft (AT group; n = 33) or a hybrid graft (HB group; n = 33). The grafts used in both groups were harvested from the peroneus longus tendon and were fixed by suturing to the surrounding periosteum. Samples were harvested for biomechanical testing, micro-computed tomography (CT), and histological evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Bone tunnels on the femoral and tibial sides were divided into 3 subregions: intra-articular (IA), midtunnel (MT), and extra-articular (EA). A cylinder-like volume of interest in the bone tunnel and a tubular-like volume of interest around the bone tunnel were used to evaluate new bone formation and bone remodeling, respectively, via micro-CT. RESULTS: In the AT group, there were significantly higher failure loads and stiffness at 8 weeks (failure load: 3.04 ñ 0.40 vs 2.09 ñ 0.54 N, respectively; P = .006) (stiffness: 3.43 ñ 0.56 vs 1.75 ñ 0.52 N/mm, respectively; P < .001) and 12 weeks (failure load: 9.10 ñ 1.13 vs 7.14 ñ 0.94 N, respectively; P = .008) (stiffness: 4.45 ñ 0.75 vs 3.36 ñ 0.29 N/mm, respectively; P = .008) than in the HB group. With regard to new bone formation in the bone tunnel, in the AT group, the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher than in the HB group on the tibial side at 8 weeks (IA: 22.21 ñ 4.98 vs 5.16 ñ 3.98, respectively; P < .001) (EA: 19.66 ñ 7.19 vs 10.85 ñ 2.16, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 30.50 ñ 5.04 vs 17.11 ñ 7.31, respectively; P = .010) (MT: 21.15 ñ 2.58 vs 15.55 ñ 4.48, respectively; P = .041) (EA: 20.75 ñ 3.87 vs 10.64 ñ 3.94, respectively; P = .003). With regard to bone remodeling around the tunnel, the BV/TV was also significantly higher on the tibial side at 8 weeks (MT: 33.17 ñ 8.05 vs 15.21 ñ 7.60, respectively; P = .007) (EA: 25.19 ñ 6.38 vs 13.94 ñ 7.10, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 69.46 ñ 4.45 vs 47.80 ñ 6.16, respectively; P < .001) (MT: 33.15 ñ 3.88 vs 13.76 ñ 4.07, respectively; P < .001) in the AT group than in the HB group. Sharpey-like fibers had formed at 8 weeks in the AT group. A large number of fibroblasts withdrew at 12 weeks. In the AT group, the width of the interface was significantly narrower at 4 weeks (85.86 ñ 17.49 vs 182.97 ñ 14.35 ?m, respectively; P < .001), 8 weeks (58.86 ñ 10.99 vs 90.15 ñ 11.53 ?m, respectively; P = .002), and 12 weeks (42.70 ñ 7.96 vs 67.29 ñ 6.55 ?m, respectively; P = .001) than in the HB group. CONCLUSION: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction may result in improved biomechanical properties and tendon-bone incorporation compared with a hybrid graft. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Augmenting small autografts with allograft tissue may result in decreased biomechanical performance and worse tendon-bone incorporation, increasing the risk of graft failure.",Embase,10.1177/0363546520967668,
290,EM-146,Baluta & Piotrowski (2020),2020,"The quality of routinely produced, pathogenreduced therapeutic FFP units by pooling of 5 single plasma units and splitting into 6 therapeutic units complies with polish and european requirements","Background: Whole-Blood (WB) derived, single donor plasma (SDP) units could vary significantly in coagulation factor content, which may impact the clinical outcome of a transfusion. To obtain a more standardized product in combination with increased blood safety, plasma pooling followed by pathogen inactivation (PI) seems to be a promising approach. The pooling of 5 single donor plasma units allows to split the pool finally into 6 therapeutic FFP doses (ò200 mL/dose), enabling the introduction of such a manufacturing process with a lower economical impact. Aims: Validation and routine production of pools of 5 SDP units resulting in 6 pathogen-reduced (PR) FFP units. Methods: Five ABO-compatible whole-blood derived SDP units (ò 270 ml) were collected from different donors and pooled using the DONOpack? plasma pooling set (LMB Technologie). Subsequently the pool was split into 2 equal mini-pools which were treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System (Cerus). Each PR mini-pool was split into 3 (ò200 ml) therapeutic platelet units, the final product was frozen within 8 h of collection (FFP). Samples of the final product were collected to assess the plasma quality by testing the white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) contamination with an automated, blood analyzer (XN-550, Sysmex). The total protein (TP) content was analyzed on a Konelab biochemistry analyzer (Thermo Fisher). The coagulation factor activity (FVIII, Fibrinogen) was assessed with an ACL Elite Pro coagulation analyzer (Werfen). Results: During the validation phase, 44 PR pools of 5 SDP units were produced resulting in 264 single FFP units with a volume of ò 200 mL respectively. RBC contamination was below the limit of detection (0.01 x 106/mL) in all PR pools. The average WBC contamination of all PR pools was 0.005 ? 106/mL (ñ0.004) with a maximum of 0.011 ? 106/mL. The average PLT contamination of all PR pools was 0.3 ? 106/mL (ñ0.9) with a maximum of 5.0 ? 106/mL. The average TP content was 59.7 g/L (ñ2.7) with a minimum of 54 g/L.

Among the available methods to predict PLT measurements, anthropometric parameters are one of the most accessible and feasible methods. The objective of this prospective study was to predict the PLT autograft sizes in single bundle ACL reconstruction by using preoperative anthropometric measurement. Method: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), shank circumference and shank length of 20 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter and length of the PLT autograft obtained. Result: Pearson correlation test has shown that body weight and height correlates to PLT length and diameter also autograft's length and diameter significantly (p < 0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that height, weight, TLL and shank length were signifcantly related to autograft diameter. While height and TLL were significantly related to autograft length. Conclusion: Height, weight, TLL and shank length can use to predict PLT autograft diameter. While height and TLL can use to predict PLT autograft length.",Embase,10.1016/j.jor.2020.03.011,

Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcome and donor site morbidity of single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneus tendon graft. This study considers the usage of peroneus longus tendon autograft as a graft of choice in ACL reconstruction. Material and methods: This prospective study was done across two different tertiary hospitals from April 2017 to June 2020. A total of 100 patients gave informed consent to be included in this study and underwent single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneous tendon graft. The functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati, Tegner-Lysholm score) were recorded before the surgery and after the surgery. Results: Out of 100, 80 patients were male and 20 patients were female. Mean age of the patients was 27.25 ñ 9.11 with range from 19 to 46 years old. Injury mechanism of the patients was motorcycle accident 7 patients, sport injury 75 patients, and others injury 18 patients. Diameter of the peroneus longus graft was measured and recorded intraoperative, and the result peroneus longus graft mean diameter was 8.55 ñ 0.73 mm. The mean of thigh circumference at 10 cm from upper pole of patella bone was 44.77 ñ 2.87 at injury site and 45.95 ñ 2.97 at contralateral site. The mean of thigh circumference at 20 cm from upper pole of patella bone was 52.77 ñ 3.73 at injury site and 53.83 ñ 3.55 at contralateral site.

(2020),2020,Changes in blood coagulation and platelet aggregation induced by incremental long?›term training in young thoroughbred racehorses during first workout season,"Background: Training has a huge effect on physiology of blood coagulation both in humans and in horses. Several hemostatic changes have been reported after exercise in the horse but data available differs. Over the last few years, studies have been performed mostly in course of acute exercise. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the hemostatic modifications in young untrained Thoroughbred racehorses in the first 4ƒmonth timeframe incremental training period in order to develop advanced training programs for equine athletes and to prevent hemorrhagic syndromes. Methods: Twentyƒnine clinically healthy, untrained, 2ƒyearƒold Thoroughbred racehorses were followed during their incremental 4ƒ month sprint exercise schedule. Blood collection was performed once a month, five times (Tƒ30, T0, T30, T60, and T90). For each time blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into vacutainer tubes with EDTA for measurement of the platelet count (Plt; Sysmex XT1800) and with sodium citrate to evaluate Clotting parameters (Prothrombin TimeƒPT, Activated Partial Prothrombin TimeƒAPTT, Thrombin timeƒ TT and fibrinogenƒFb concentrations using standard kits for ACL TOP coagulometer) and platelet aggregation in plateletƒrich plasmaƒPRP prepared by centrifugation at 120 g for 15 min (light transmission aggregometry, APACTƒ4, Helena). Platelet aggregation was measured in response to various agonists: 1, 5, and 10 ?M adenosine diphosphate (ADP), 4 ?g/mL collagen and 5 ?M of calcium ionophore A23187. Platelet function was also evaluated using the Platelet Function Analyzer (PFAƒ100) using collagen/ADP and collagen/adrenaline cartridges, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Differences among the time points were analyzed (KruskalƒWallis oneƒway analysis of variance, Dunn's Multiple comparison postƒtest, Fisher's exact test) and meanSEM were calculated (Graph Pad Statistics software). Results: Significant modifications were identified compared with Tƒ30 for Plt count and clotting parameters assessed at T30. Plasma Fb levels increased (173 7 vs 148 6.5 mg/dL), PT and TT were shorter (15.2 0.2 vs 16.8 0.1 sec and 16 0.1 vs 18 0.1 sec, respectively) with concomitant increase of platelet aggregation induced by collagen (32.6 4.8 vs 21.6 4.9%), ADP 1 ?M (35.5 2.0 vs 24.5 3.1%), and A23187 (30 4.7 vs 23.8 4%) and a shorter closure time of CƒADP cartridges on the PFAƒ100analyser (75.6 4.4 vs 87.7 3.4 sec). All these parameters tend to return to baseline value at T90. Conclusions: The first longƒterm training period was found to induce hypercoagulability and platelet hyperreactivity already after 30 days in untrained Thoroughbreds.

Methods: Eighty healthy New Zealand white rabbits were harvested to prepare ACL injury models and randomly divided into two groups ( n=40). The ACL was reconstructed with vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft in group A and peroneus longus tendon graft without blood supply in group B. The survival of animals and the healing of incision were observed after operation; the grafts were taken for gross and histological observations at 4, 8, and 16 weeks; the biomechanical test of the grafts was carried out to record the maximum tensile strength and incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks. Results: All animals survived until the experiment completed. General observation showed that the tunnel was combined with grafts, the vascular infiltration was abundant, and no obvious boundary between the tunnel and grafts existed at 16 weeks in group A; there was still an obvious boundary between the tunnel and graft in group B. Histological observation showed that the collagen fibers between tendon and bone in group A increased gradually, the dense fiber connection was formed, and the ""tidal-line"" like structure similar to the normal ACL insertion was formed at 16 weeks; but the""tidal-line"" like structure was not obvious in group B. Biomechanical test showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks between group A and group B ( P=0.680; P=0.590), but the maximum tensile strength at 8 and 16 weeks were higher in group A than in group B ( t=18.503, P=0.001; t=25.391, P=0.001).

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 35 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy between October 2017 and October 2018. There were 19 males and 16 females with an average age of 43.4 years (range, 18-60 years), with 20 cases of left knee and 15 cases of right knee. The causes of injury included traffic accident in 14 cases, falling injury in 13 cases, and sports injury in 8 cases. The time from injury to operation ranged from 3 to 9 days (mean, 4.7 days). The patients suffered from swelling, pain, and limited mobility of knee joint before operation. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were positive before operation, whereas MRI was taken to confirm the ACL rupture. After operation, the patients were followed up every 3 months until the knee joint's function returned to normal. MRI and X-ray films were used to observe the tendon-bone healing as well as the position of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were conducted to observe the improvement of knee joint mobility. The functional improvements were evaluated by the International Knee Documents Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, knee injury and osteoarthritis (KOOS) score. Results: All the 35 patients were followed up 12-18 months, with an average of 14.2 months. The incisions healed by first intention, and no complications such as infection, joint stiffness, and rerupture occurred. Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test turned to be negative of all patients. MRI showed that the ACL was continuous, and the tendon-bone in the distal femur tunnel and proximal tibia tunnel recovered well after operation. X-ray films showed that the positions of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail were stable. The IKDC, Lysholm, and KOOS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation were significantly improved when compared with those before operation, and the scores were further improved with time after operation ( P<0.05).

296,EM-152,,2020,Comparison of the Functional Outcome of Site Peroneus Longus Graft Donors With and Without Distal Stump Suturing of Peroneus Tendon Brevis on ACL Reconstruction Case .,"Brief Summary Injury of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is one of the most common sports injuries. The incidence rate reaches 68.6 cases per 100,000 people per year. Management of ACL injuries for individuals who want to return to the level of exercise activity as before, mostly in the form of reconstructive surgery. As many as 60,000 to 175,000 cases of ACL reconstruction per year are carried out in the United States At present, many reconstructive surgeries are performed by taking tendon grafts on the patient's own body (autograft) to then be used instead of the ACL. The most widely used graft sources are Hamstring and Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone (BPTB) grafts. Other alternative grafts are Quadriceps tendon, Fascia Lata, Iliotibial Band, and Peroneus Longus Tendon. Each graft retrieval technique has advantages and disadvantages. BPTB graft has the best tensile strength and bone union with bone, but the complications of anterior knee pain are also quite common (5-55%). Hamstring grafts and Quadriceps grafts minimize the complications of anterior knee pain, with fairly good tensile strength, but the union of grafts with bone takes longer. The loss of Hamstring tendons also causes a decrease in muscle strength in Hamstring, where Hamstring has an important role in preventing the anterior translation of the tibia Peroneus Longus Tendon graft is an alternative graft developed to minimize complications associated with graft use from the area around the knee. Peroneus Longus tendons also have tensile strength similar to Hamstring tendons. As with other graft extracts, Peroneus Longus tendon graft is also accompanied by complications in the donor site. Possible complications arising from the loss of the Peroneus Longus tendon include ankle instability and decreased flexion strength of the 1st ray and ankle eversion. Research carried out by Bancha et al showed a reduction in flexion strength of 1st ray and ankle eversion significantly, without any instability in the ankle. Peroneus longus provides 5.5% strength for moderate dorsiflexion for ankle eversion movements, peroneus longus is the main muscle. But in other studies it is said that the use of peroneus longus graft does not interfere with the stability of the ankle and ROM. Does not even affect the functional outcome of the ankle However, in a study conducted by Bancha et al and Kerimoglu et al., The technique used for taking Peroneus Longus graft tendons did not include suturing in the distal stump of Peroneous Longus. So with this study, researchers wanted to find out whether different results would be found related to donor site complications if the technique used included suturing the distal stump of the Peroneus Longus tendon against the peroneus brevis tendon",Embase,,

However, one of the considerations in choosing autograft is donor site morbidity. This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantar flexion strength between donor site and its contralateral. Hypothesis : The study hypothesis was that the eversion and first ray plantar flexion muscle strength were different between harvest site and contralateral healthy site. Methods: From March 2017 to December 2018, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft were included in this study. From the first day after surgery, the patients followed rehabilitation protocol. Ankle eversion and first ray plantar flexion strength were measured using a modifieddynamometer 6-months after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scoring system for ankle and hindfoot. Results: Thirty-one patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with 22 males and 9 females, ranging from 18-45 years of age (mean: 27.58ñ8.69). There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at donor site compared to contralateral (p=0.54) with means 65.87ñ7.63 N and 66.96ñ8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantar flexion strength at donor site compared to contralateral (p=0.68) with means 150.64ñ11.67 N and 152.10ñ12.16 N, respectively. The FADI score of 99.71ñ0.57 and AOFAS score of 98.71ñ3.03 were considered excellent results. Conclusion: Our study shows that donor site ankle eversion and first ray plantar flexion strengths were similar with the contralateral healthy site with no donor site morbidity.

There was no significant difference in the presentation of proximal, medial, and distal areas while there was a significant difference between age and regeneration of the proximal area, p <0.05 (p = 0.047). Tissue regeneration was tendinous and it appeared smaller in the place where the tendons grew. CONCLUSION: Regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon occurred after ACL reconstruction at a 1-year follow-up according to MRI.",Embase,10.3889/oamjms.2020.5487,
303,EM-159,Shi et al. (2020),2020,Systematic evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, it has been reported that peroneus longus tendon can be used as a new graft material for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and can achieve the same effect as hamstring tendon. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the two graft materials for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect of reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament with peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon by meta-analysis. METHODS: We retrieved controlled clinical trials which compared the long peroneal tendons and hamstring tendons in reconstructing anterior cruciate ligament respectively in Chinese database (WanFang, CNKI, VIP, Chinese biological medicine) and English database (Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane library). The retrieval time was from database creation to March 2019. Literature screening and evaluation and data extraction were performed by two evaluators. Meta-analysis was evaluated using Revman5. 3 software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) A total of 413 Chinese or English literatures were retrieved and 10 of them were included in the final analysis. Among 647 patients receiving anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 271 patients used peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and 376 patients used hamstring tendon reconstruction. (2) Meta-analysis results: Postoperative functional score: There was significant difference in Lysholm score at postoperative 12 months (MD=1. 23, 95%C/[0. 31, 2. 51], P=0. 000 9) and IKDC score at postoperative 6 months (MD=3. 19, 95%C/[0. 07, 6. 31], P=0. 02) between peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and hamstring tendon groups. The occurrence of postoperative complications in the peroneus longus tendon group was significantly lower than that in the hamstring tendon group (OR=0. 15, 95%C/[0. 03, 0. 69], P=0. 01). However, there were no significant differences in Tegner scores, degree of joint motion, degree of joint relaxation at postoperative 6 and 12 months between peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and hamstring tendon groups. No significant difference was found in Lysholm score at postoperative 6 months and in IKDC score at postoperative 12 months between these two groups. The results showed that the clinical effect of peroneus longus tendon in reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament was comparable to that of hamstring tendon; in the peroneus longus tendon reconstruction group, the Lysholm score at postoperative 12 months and IKDC score at postoperative 6 months were significantly superior to those in the hamstring tendon group. The incidence of postoperative complications in the peroneus longus tendon reconstruction group was lower than that in the hamstring tendon group. The peroneus longus tendon can be clinically recommended to substitute hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. However, the quality of included literatures is limited; therefore higher quality of evidence is required to validate this conclusion.",Embase,10.3969/j.issn.2095-4344.1964,

(2020),2020,Combined hamstrings and peroneus longus tendon for undersized graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A report of two adolescence female patients,"Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury in young and active population and reconstruction is the mainstay treatment to maintain stability of the knee. Hamstring tendon (HT) is the most popular graft for ACL reconstruction. In certain patient, particularly in women, the size of tendon graft to reconstruct the ACL is unpredictable. In the case of unqualified donor, we need a combined graft from another source to match the size requirement. Case presentation: We present two cases of ACL reconstruction using combination of HT and PLT graft in adolescent female. We evaluate knee functional score and ankle donor site morbidity. In the second case we also did second look for the ACL graft integrity arthroscopically. This study has been reported in line with the Surgical Case Report (SCARE) criteria. Discussion: One year after surgery, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score for both cases were improved and no ankle-donor site morbidity with good motoric power and 100% American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Score (AOFAS). Conclusion: Additional peroneus longus tendon can be considered as an alternative in undersized hamstring tendon graft without significant donor site morbidity.",Embase,10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.09.136,

(2019),2019,Preliminary result of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft,"BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the most successful operations in sports medicine. At present, ligament autografts have been the best method due to good histocompatibility, rapid healing, no cross-contamination, and low cost of treatment. However, autografts do not have infinite amount and are also not always feasible. Anterior half of peroneus longus tenden autograft is likely to become a source of autograft with many advantages. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT). AIM: To evaluate the initial outcome of ACL reconstruction arthroscopy by anterior half of peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This is a prospective non-controlled case series. RESULTS: A prospective study on 30 patients (from 9 / 2016 to 01 / 2019) had both ACL and MCL injury who had operated ACL reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT) at Department of General Orthopaedic and Trauma, Viet Duc hospital. Our outcome: the year average 35.4 ys, the rate of ACL rupture combined with meniscus injury was 40%. The average diameter AHPLT autograft is 7.0 mm. The function Lysholm scores improved from 59 to 94.27 postoperative 6 months. No difference beetwen the AOFAS scale of preoperative and postoperative.

306,EM-162,Rhatomy et al. (2019),2019,Influence of anthropometric features on peroneus longus graft diameter in Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction: A cohort study,"Background: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is the most common ligament injury during sports activities that was treated with ACL reconstruction. Nowadays, peroneus longus is used in ACL reconstruction. However, it is difficult to predict the peroneus longus graft diameter for ACL reconstruction. Thus, preoperative measurements are very important to predict peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction. Methods: A cohort retrospective study was conducted using consecutive sampling method from February 2016 until October 2017 in our center. We recorded patients? characteristics include gender, age, body weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) preoperatively. We measured peroneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively, and analysed data using Spearman correlation. Results: Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. There were 28 males and 11 females in the peroneus group. From the patients' mean characteristics, age was 25.10 ñ 9.16, body weight 71.23 ñ 14.17, height 169.13 ñ 8.81, and BMI 20.96 ñ 3.44. Intraoperative peroneus longus diameter measurement was 8.56 ñ 0.82. Spearman correlation showed significant correlation between intraoperative peroneus longus diameter with patient's height, body weight, and BMI with p < 0.05. Conclusion: Patients? characteristics including gender, height, weight, and BMI in preoperative measurements can predict peoneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively.",Embase,10.1016/j.amsu.2019.10.023,
307,EM-163,Rhatomy et al. (2019),2019,Peroneus longus autograft can be recommended as a superior graft to hamstring tendon in single-bundle ACL reconstruction,"PURPOSE: A peroneus longus tendon autograft is used in many orthopaedic procedures and it is biomechanically comparable to a hamstring tendon autograft. Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity of ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts versus peroneus longus tendon autografts in patients with an isolated ACL injury. METHODS: Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (hamstring n = 28, peroneus n = 24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8 ñ 0.7 mm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2 ñ 0.8 mm) (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3 ñ 4.2 and for the FADI 98 ñ 3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.

308,EM-164,Rhatomy et al. (2019),2019,Eversion and First Ray Plantarflexion Muscle Strength in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using a Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"Background: The peroneus longus tendon has been used as a graft in orthopaedic reconstruction surgery because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hamstring tendon. However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. Results: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 ñ 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P =.55), with means of 65.87 ñ 7.63 N and 66.96 ñ 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P =.68), with means of 150.64 ñ 11.67 N and 152.10 ñ 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 ñ 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 ñ 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. Conclusion: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity. This suggests that the peroneus longus tendon is a promising graft in ACL reconstruction.",Embase,10.1177/2325967119872462,
309,EM-165,Wong et al. (2019),2019,Biomechanical and geometric characterization of peroneus longus allografts with respect to age,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are among the most common injuries in high impact sports, and reconstruction is the standard surgical procedure for these ruptures. Reconstructions are often performed using allografts rather than autografts on a case-by-case basis. Controversy exists as to whether or not age of donor tissue plays a factor in the mechanical properties of allografts. Methods: 38 peroneus longus (PL) tendons were prepared using the two-strand graft technique and then subjected to a cyclic loading test regimen of 1000 cycles to determine material properties. Specimens were grouped based on age to ascertain whether donor age affects the material properties of PL tendons. Findings: Secant modulus of the first cycle was determined to be 150.43 (SD 40.24) MPa. The average magnitude of the dynamic modulus was determined to be 82.81 (SD 24.65) MPa. Specimens were grouped into three distinct groups for analysis (x < 40 yo, 40 yo ó x < 60 yo, 60 yo < x). Interpretation: The need for using intrinsic material properties is highlighted. There is no significant difference in any intrinsic material property with respect to age or the fatigue of the tendon as the cycle count increases. Conversely, the measured stiffness of a tendon decreased as function of age with a large effect size. Based on analysis of graft geometries, it was determined that PL tendons become significantly more slender with increased age which result in the observed decrease in stiffness.",Embase,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2019.04.017,

Regardless the potential, there was no study about the use of PLT autograft in Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcome and donor site morbidity after single bundle PCL reconstruction using PLT autograft. Methods: Patient who met inclusion criteria, enrolled to this study and underwent single bundle PCL reconstruction using PL tendon autograft. Clinical outcomes were assessed with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati scoring systems, Lysholm score, and Serial hop test (single hop test and triple hop test) 2-year after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed with Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle (AOFAS) scoring system. Results: Fifteen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (11 males and 4 females). PLT graft diameters were 7.5?10 mm (mean: 8.30 ñ 0.65 mm). Significant increase of functional score (p < 0.05) were found two years after surgery. Mean score of IKDC was 47.58 ñ 11.75 pre-operative; 78.17 ñ 4.52 post-operative, Modified Cincinnati was 48.86 ñ 12.22 pre-operative; 79.00 ñ 4.82 post-operative, Lysholm score was 49.26 ñ 11.54 pre-operative; 80.20 ñ 5.04 post-operative. FADI and AOFAS at donor site ankle was 93.00 ñ 3.04 and 93.26 ñ 4.20, respectively. Serial hop test showed good result.

Methods: Between June 2015 and February 2018, 28 patients with ACL rupture and MCL grade ? injury were treated. Arthroscopic GraftLink technique was used to reconstruct ACL with autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT), and suture anchor fixation was used to repair MCL. There were 22 males and 6 females, aged 21-47 years, with an average age of 30.4 years. The cause of injury included traffic accident in 18 cases, falling from height in 7 cases, and sports injury in 3 cases. The time from injury to admission was 1-2 weeks, with an average of 1.3 weeks. The preoperative Lysholm score of knee joint was 46.8ñ3.0 and the International Knee Documentation Commission (IKDC) score was 49.2ñ2.7. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of ankle joint was 98.29ñ0.72. Both Lachman test and valgus stress test were positive. There were 8 cases of meniscus injury and 2 cases of cartilage injury. Results: The operation time ranged from 55 to 90 minutes, with an average of 72.5 minutes. All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no complications related to operation occurred. All patients were followed up 6-38 months, with an average of 20.7 months. At 3 months after operation, the range of motion of the knee joint was 116- 132ø, with an average of 122ø. Lachman test showed that the anterior translation more than 5 mm in 2 cases, and the others were negative; while the valgus stress test showed that all patients were positive. At 6 months after operation, the Lysholm score and IKDC score of knee joint were 90.2ñ1.8 and 93.5ñ2.3, respectively, which were significantly higher than preoperative scores ( t=31.60, P=0.00; t=29.91, P=0.01); AOFAS score of ankle joint was 97.86ñ0.68, with no significant difference compared with preoperative score ( t=2.89, P=0.08). KT-1000 test showed that the difference of anterior relaxation between bilateral knee joints was less than 2 mm in 25 cases and 3 to 5 mm in 3 cases. Conclusion: The method of ACL reconstruction via arthroscopic GraftLink technique with PLT and MCL repair via suture anchor fixation has the advantages of less knee injury and faster recovery, and there is no significant impact on ankle function after tendon removal.",Embase,10.7507/1002-1892.201812062,

(2019),2019,"Supplemental Fixation of Inner Graft Limbs in All-Inside, Quadrupled, Single-Tendon Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Graft Construct Yields Improved Biomechanical Properties","Purpose: To compare the time-zero load to failure of a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction graft construct with (supplemented) and without the incorporation of inner-limb whipstitch sutures (control) into a tibial suspensory fixation button. Methods: Eight matched pairs of peroneus longus tendons were prepared according to a quadrupled, all-inside ACL soft-tissue graft technique with 1 side serving as a control and the contralateral side supplemented. The constructs were biomechanically tested for strain in the inner and outer limbs during a preconditioning protocol, single-cycle load to failure, and elongation of the whole construct. Results: Ultimate load to failure was significantly higher in the supplemented group: 797.5 ñ 49.6 N (95% confidence interval [CI], 763.13-831.87 N) versus 719.6 ñ 69.6 N (95% CI, 671.38-767.82 N; P =.044). Less graft elongation at failure was observed in the supplemented group (3.1 ñ 1.5 mm; 95% CI, 2.07-4.17 mm) versus the control group (21.0 ñ 21.2 mm; 95% CI, 6.31-35.69 mm; P =.052). The number of grafts undergoing a 5-mm or greater change in length at failure was 1 of 8 in the supplemented group versus 5 of 8 in the control group (P =.038). Conclusions: Inner-limb supplemental tibial fixation results in higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation in a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside ACL reconstruction graft construct. Clinical Relevance: The weak point of a single-tendon, quadrupled, all-inside ACL graft construct is the tendon-to-tendon suturing to secure the inner limbs of the graft. Adding supplemental fixation by incorporating the sutures from the inner limb to the tibial suspensory fixation button leads to a higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation.",Embase,10.1016/j.arthro.2018.10.130,
313,EM-169,Sun et al. (2019),2019,Anti-GAPDH autoantibody is associated with increased disease activity and intracranial pressure in systemic lupus erythematosus,"Objective. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune disease characterized by multiorgan involvement. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers. The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE. However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive. In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE. Methods. Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE. White blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (HB), platelet count (PLT), IgG, IgA, IgM, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), RF, anti-cardiolipin (Acl), ANA, AnuA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, ?2-GPI, urinalysis, and 24 h urine protein were measured by standard laboratory techniques. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index scores were evaluated accordingly. Results. The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (P = 0 0011). Elevated serum anti-GAPDH was correlated with increased SLEDAI-2K (P = 0 017), ESR, IgG, and IgM and associated with increased intracranial pressure and incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, but it was protective for seizure disorder incidence. Conclusions. Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity. It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice.",Embase,10.1155/2019/7430780,

We investigated the efficacy and safety of this alternative autograft compared with autologous hamstring tendon (HT). Biomechanical testing of the graft options was performed and compared with the native ACL. Thirty-eight patients with acute ACL ruptures and grade III MCL injuries were treated with ACL reconstruction with a doubled autologous PLT or quadrupled autologous HT. Knee stability and function was evaluated clinically with the Lachman test and KT-2000 arthometer as well as subjectively with functional scores. Effects on the donor ankle were evaluated by biomechanical testing. The ultimate tensile strengths of doubled PLT and quadrupled HT were significantly higher than that of the native ACL and the ultimate tensile strength of doubled PLT was comparable with that of quadrupled HT. There were no significant differences in clinical or functional scores between the two groups. There were no significant differences in pre- and postoperative biomechanical testing of the donor ankle. PLT is a suitable alternative autograft for an ACL reconstruction in patients with a concomitant grade III MCL injury without a significant biomechanical disadvantage to the ankle donor site.,Embase,10.1055/s-0038-1669951,

METHODS: The levels of serum s-Eng were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 139 patients with APS, 44 patients with SLE but no APS, 37 patients with primary Sj”gren's syndrome (pSS), 23 patients with Bechet's disease (BD), 22 patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and 22 persistent anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) positive individuals without SLE or APS (simply aCL positive group) and 87 health controls (HC) without any auto-immune diseases. These APS patients included 64 primary APS patients and 75 APS patients secondary to SLE.The correlation between the clinical data, laboratory parameters, and serum s-Eng levels were analyzed.Independent samples t test, paired t test, Chi-square Test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's ?2 test were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: (1) The serum levels of s-Eng were significantly higher in the patients with APS whether primary or secondary to SLE than in the health controls and simply aCL positive group and the patients with other autoimmune diseases, including SLE, pSS, BD and SSc (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the serum s-Eng levels between simply aCL positive group and health controls [(5.17ñ2.00) mg/L vs. (5.04ñ1.11) mg/L, P>0.05]. (2) The best cut-off value for the diagnosis of APS was no less than 8.37 mg/L as mean ñ 3SD value, with the sensitivity at 0.772 and the specificity at 0.928. The Youden index was 0.700. These results indicated good validity of s-Eng as a diagnostic marker for APS. (3) The proportions of artery thrombosis and pathological pregnancy were higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than that in s-Eng-negative group (46/81 vs. 19/58, 29/65 vs. 10/44, respectively, all P<0.05). The levels of PLT were lower in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients (72.00?109/L vs. 119.00?109/L, P<0.001). (4) The proportions of the presence (93.83% vs. 37.93%, P<0.001) and titer (61.70 U/mL vs. 15.45 U/mL, P<0.001) of aCL were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group. The proportions of the presence (61.73% vs. 43.10%, P<0.05) and titer (33.48 U/mL vs.17.40 U/mL, P<0.05) of anti-?2-glycoprotein I antibody were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group too. CONCLUSION: s-Eng serum levels were significantly increased in the patients with APS, and it may play a role as acomplementary serological marker for the diagnosis and risk prediction of APS.",Embase,,

(2018),2018,Predicting the graft diameter of the peroneus longus tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between various anthropometric parameters and the graft diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT). We retrospectively analyzed the data of 156 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with the PLT graft at our institution. Anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, gender, age, duration of injury, and preinjury activity levels, were recorded. t tests, correlation coefficients (Pearson r), and a multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter of the graft obtained. The mean PLT graft diameter was 8.3 mm, and 21 patients (13.5%) had a diameter less than 8 mm; 85 patients (54.5%) had a diameter between 8 and 9 mm, and 50 patients (32.0%) had a diameter greater than or equal to 9 mm. The correlation analysis showed that height (P < .001), weight (P < .001), and duration of injury (P = .012) were significantly related to graft diameter. On the basis of these 3 predictors, the following regression equation was obtained: Diameter = 2.28 + 0.028?height (cm) + 0.013?weight (kg) + 0.289?duration of injury (0 or 1). Patients who were short and shin were more likely to own smaller graft diameters (<8 mm), especially the one ruptured his or her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) over 3 months. Height, weight, and duration of injury were associated with the diameter of PLT. They are important preoperative information for surgeon about the size of PLT and can be used for alternative graft source planning and patient counseling.",Embase,10.1097/MD.0000000000012672,

Blood cultures were collected and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Initial thought was that the patient's central line (port) was contaminated. The following evening the septic symptoms were linked to the transfusion and a transfusion reaction was reported to the transfusion service (TS). Study Design/Method: The blood supplier was notified of the transfusion reaction, but the original PLT containers were no longer available for culture. The 1st unit transfused had a concurrent plasma available and a second PLT container from this same collection that was transfused to a patient in another hospital facility without any reports of adverse reactions. The 2nd unit transfused was part of a triple collection with a 2nd container returned to the blood supplier due to the presence of clots on the 4th day after collection. The 3rd PLT container from the 2nd unit transfused had been transfused to a post-bone marrow transplant patient about 6:30 am on the same day as the other transfused container with no signs or symptoms of a transfusion reaction. Cultures from the concurrent plasma of the 1st unit transfused were negative, but cultures from the clotted PLT from the 2nd unit transfused were positive and identified as Methicillin-susceptible Staph-ylococcus aureus. Blood cultures from the septic patient also grew Methicil-lin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Results/Finding: The initial culture performed on the parent PLT product by the blood center was sampled 24 hours after the collection and was negative after 5 days incubation on the BACT/ALERT? instrument; additionally, the initial samples were subsequently plated after notification of the transfusion reaction and found to be negative. All 3 PLT containers from the sus-pect collection were tested at the hospital using point of issue bacterial testing (Verax Platelet PGD? Test) on midnight of day 3 into day 4 and found to be negative for the presence of bacteria. S. aureus from the patient blood culture and the positive PLT container were sent for genotyping and found to be identical, indicating that the patient's septic reaction was caused by the transfused PLT product. Conclusion: Although point of issue bacterial screening was performed, it appears that the level of bacteria was below the limit of detection which may have resulted in the false negative results. On the clinical side, even after symptoms of a reaction were present, the initial assumption was that the patient had a central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI). Discussion with clinical staff shows that the current CLABSI investigation process does not include checking to see if blood products have recently been given that may have caused patient to be septic. The other lesson learned was that the TS did not realize that the clot found in one of the containers might indicate the presence bacteria and that the co-components should have been removed from the inventory.",Embase,10.1111/trf.14903,
318,EM-174,Lord et al. (2018),2018,ACL graft compression: a method to allow reduced tunnel sizes in ACL reconstruction,"RESULTS: Mean decreases in CSA of 31% under a stress of 471 kPa and 21% under a stress of 447 kPa were observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19% over 12 h compared to 2% for controls. No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability; mean cyclic displacements were 0.3 mm for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: No detrimental biomechanical effects of graft compression on allograft PL tendons were observed. Following compression, the grafts significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability between groups. Graft compression did not cause adverse mechanical effects in vitro. Smaller tunnels for compressed grafts reduce bone loss and ease anatomical placement. PURPOSE: A common problem during ACL reconstruction is asymmetry of proximal-distal graft diameter leading to tunnel upsizing and graft-tunnel mismatch. Compression downsizing provides a graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique and its effects on graft biomechanics and stability. It was hypothesised that compression downsizing would significantly reduce cross-sectional area (CSA); that no significant changes in graft biomechanics would occur; graft fixation stability would be improved. METHOD: Sixty-eight non-irradiated peroneus longus (PL) tendons were investigated. Twenty were halved and paired into ten four-strand grafts, 20 strands were compressed by 0.5-1 mm diameter and changes in CSA recorded using an alginate mould technique. The following properties were compared with 20 control strands: cyclic strain when loaded 70-220 N for 1000 cycles; stiffness; ultimate tensile load and stress; Young's modulus. 24 PL tendons were quadrupled into grafts, 12 were compressed and all 24 were submerged in Ringer's solution at 37 øC and the CSA recorded over 12 h. Twelve compressed and 12 control quadrupled grafts were mounted in porcine femurs, placed in Ringer's solution for 12 h at 37 øC and graft displacement at the bone tunnel aperture recorded under cyclic loading.",Embase,10.1007/s00167-018-4932-4,
319,EM-175,Mamoto et al. (2018),2018,T1&RHO and T2 of articular cartilage after ACL injury predict patient-reported outcomes at 3 years after ACL reconstruction,"Purpose: ACL injury have a high risk of development of early posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) even after ACL reconstruction. However, the associations between cartilage damage and degeneration during PTOA development and patient-reported outcomes in the patients with ACL injury are still unclear. We previously reported that T1? and T2 of cartilage of posterolateral tibia (pLT) after ACL injury were associated with Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 1-year after ACL injury. Therefore, the aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the longitudinal changes of T1? and T2 values in the knee cartilage after acute ACL injury and reconstruction, and 2) to investigate the relationship between cartilage damage after ACL injury evaluated by MRI T1? and T2 mapping and KOOS at 3-year after surgery. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, bilateral knees were scanned using a 3 Tesla MRI T1? and T2 mapping for 36 patients with ACL injury (age = 31.49 ñ 7.61 years, BMI = 23.87ñ 2.52 kg/m2, 15 female) at baseline (prior to surgical reconstruction), 6 month, 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery and 14 healthy controls (age = 31.38 ñ 4.89 years, BMI = 23.61ñ 1.87 kg/m2, 5 female) at baseline, 1 and 3 years. Fourteen sub-compartments of the knee cartilage were semi-automatically segmented (Fig. 1). The mean and standard deviation of T1? and T2 values of each defined cartilage compartments were calculated. Patients also completed KOOS at baseline, 6 month, 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery. Linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, BMI were built to evaluate the association between cartilage T1? or T2 at baseline and KOOS at 3-year. Results: Significant larger increases of cartilage T1? and T2 from baseline to 3 year were observed in the injured knee of patients compared to controls in medial femoral condyle (MFC) for T1? and T2, and in medial tibia (MT) for T1? only (Table 1). The increases of cartilage T1? and T2 were fastest for the first 6-month (Fig. 2 showing MFC as an example), constituting 84.9 and 86.3% of the increase from baseline to 3-year, respectively. Linear regression analysis showed that higher cartilage T1? of pLT at baseline was associated with worse KOOS quality of life (b = -2.285, p = 0.029, Fig. 3). Conclusions: Significant increases in cartilage T1? and T2 of the medial side were observed at 3-years after ACL reconstruction, indicating early degeneration of the joint in patients after ACL injury. Very interestingly, the most increases occurred in the first 6-month after ACL reconstruction, suggesting the early cartilage degeneration may be caused more by the toxic biochemical environment after ACL injury and surgery, rather than the biomechanical factors which may cause the continuous but smaller increase at later stages (after 6-month). T1? of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS at 3-year after ACL reconstruction, implying the severity of damages to cartilage during ACL rupture can be potential predictor for patient long-term outcomes. These findings suggest quantitative MRI can be used as powerful tools for detecting very early degenerative changes in the knee after ACL injury and for identifying patients who have worse clinic outcomes to allow early interventions in these patients, and thus, improve patient management.",Embase,,

(2018),2018,Clinical Outcomes Following Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Hamstring Autograft versus Planned Hybrid Graft,"Few studies have compared outcomes between autografts versus hybrid grafts (combination of autograft and allograft) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this study was to compare revision rate and patient-reported outcomes following primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft versus a preoperatively planned hybrid autograft-allograft. At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with a double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring autograft (A) or a planned hybrid (H) graft (single-strand semitendinosus with nonirradiated peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up. From this collection of patients, a matched-pair comparison was made between groups, with patients matched by gender, age at the time of surgery, and follow-up time. Revision rate at follow-up was 8.4 and 2.4% in the A and H groups, respectively (p = 0.073). A total of 148 surveys were completed (83 A, 65 H), from which 36 matched pairs were formed. Within the matched pairs, average age at surgery did not differ significantly between groups (A: 35.7 years, H: 36.0 years, p = 0.23). Time to follow-up was 4.3 and 3.7 years in the A and H groups, respectively. Patients with a hybrid graft had significantly higher KOOS Quality of Life subscores (A 69.6, H 79.2, p = 0.028), subjective IKDC scores (A 72.6, H 79.7, p = 0.031), and SANE scores (A 83.2, H 91.4, p = 0.015) at follow-up. Otherwise, no significant differences were found in patient-reported outcome scores between groups. A preoperatively planned hybrid graft, with use of a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated allograft, should be considered as a viable alternative for primary ACLR in older patients.",Embase,10.1055/s-0037-1617417,

However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0 ñ 3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Tunnel positions, which were confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomical positions. At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4 ñ 7.1 vs. 89.3. ñ 8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71 ñ 0.57 vs. 1.85 ñ 0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15 ñ 0.36 vs. 0.10 ñ 0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1 ñ 1.40 vs. 99.5 ñ 1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up. An AHPLT autograft may be a good alternative for all-inside ACL reconstruction with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity.",Embase,10.1055/s-0038-1627466,

Compression downsizing provides an ACL graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique, effects on graft biomechanics, and changes in graft stability. Methods: Sixty-eight peroneus longus (PL) Bioclense? treated allograft tendons were fashioned into either four-or single-strand configuration and the following assessed: changes in cross-sectional area following compression and soaking in Ringer's solution at 37øC; cyclic strain (70-220 N) for 1000 cycles; ultimate failure load; stiffness; ultimate tensile strength; Young's modulus; stability at the tunnel aperture in porcine femurs under cyclic loading. Results: A mean decrease in CSA of 16.4% (Pb0.001) under a stress of 471 kPa and 13.1% (Pb0.001) under a stress of 447 kPa was observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19.4% over 12 hours compared to 1.5% for controls (Pb0.004).

323,EM-179,Federici et al. (2017),2017,Imbalance between ADAMTS13 and VWF activities might identify thrombotic of bleeding events in essential thrombocythemia (ET): Results from a cohort of 72 cases,"Background. Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) may have thrombotic and bleeding complications with increased morbidity and mortality. Age, previous history of thrombosis, elevated white cell counts and JAK2 allele burden are considered risk factors for both arterial (ATE) and venous (VTE) thrombosis while elevated platelet counts and qualitative defects of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) are associated with bleeds. ADAMTS13 regulates the pro-thrombotic activities of the VWF: reduced levels of ADAMTS13 or VWF activities expose patients to increased risk of thrombosis or bleeds. Aims: to evaluate whether or not the reduced activities of ADAMTS13/VWF were associated with thrombotic/bleeding complications, 72 patients with ET diagnosed according to WHO criteria at the Hematology Center of the L. Sacco University Hospital of Milan have been observed prospectively during a 36-month follow-up. Methods: Patients were exposed to all the diagnostic tests required for ET diagnosis and signed an informed consent for these ADAMTS13/VWF evaluations. VWF (VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag) activities and FVIII were measured in citrated plasma by the automatic ACL-TOP systems using commercially available reagent kits while ADAMTS-13 by TECHNOZYM activity ELISA. Statistical analyses among the cases with or without complications were performed with SPSS. Results: the cohort of ET patients was positive for JAK2(59%)/MPL(5%)/CALR(12%) with negative mutations in 17 cases. 3 different groups were found in this cohort: A)NOCOMPL=39/72(54.2%);B)ATE/VTE=22/72(30.5%);C)BLEEDS=11/72(15.2). The following clinical-lab data [median(range) according to these A/B/C groups are: M-F=11-28/5-17/3-8; Age=68(17-88)/73(33-89)/64(38-80);Plt-counts(/uL)=566(430-780)/559(398-551)/704(478-1342);VWF:ACT(U/dL)=98(76-238)/163(86-282)/63(27-92); ADAMTS13(U/dL)=86(56-144)/45(31-105)/85(49/152);VWF:ACT/Ag:ratio=0.85(0.7-1.4)/0.75(0.6-1.2)/0.65(0.2/0.8); ADAMTS13/VWF:ACTratio=0.74(0.41-1.8)/0.54(0.25/1.2)/0.76(0.5-2.5). Liver and/or spleen enlargement was found in 23/72(32%) of all A/B/C patients but did not correlate with complications. A total of 30 ATE/VTE and 18 major/minor bleeds were observed in these 22 and 11 ET with complications while 6 patients had both VTE and BLEEDS during follow-up. Reduced levels of ADAMTS13 and of VWF activities correlated with the observed thrombotic and bleeding event. Conclusion: In a well characterized cohort of ET patients we could find that reduced levels of ADAMTS13 and VWF activities can be associated with their thrombotic and bleeding complications. These assays might be useful during the clinical follow-up to identify patient at risk for these complications.",Embase,,
324,EM-180,,2017,STUDY OF THE ADAMTS-13 LEVEL AS PREDICTIVE BIOMARKER FOR DEVELOPMENT OF PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS IN LIVER CIRRHOSIS,"Brief Summary Patients with cirrhosis of viral etiology (HCV/HBV); Patients with cirrhosis of any other etiology (alcohol, idiopatic, autoimmune). Planned Number of cirrhotic subjects 200 patients Inclusion Criteria Subjects (18 yr old) with liver cirrhosis of any etiology, Exclusion Criteria All patients should not have hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignant tumors, they should not be treated with anticoagulant / antiplatelet agents, not affected by PVT already diagnosed and not suffering from congenital coagulation disorders (haemophilia A / B, von disease Willebrand, another congenital deficiency of coagulation factors) or severe thrombocytopenia (\<30,000 Plt / ?L). Subject has participated in another clinical study within 30 days prior to study enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study on cirrhosis Primary Objective To describe the prospective modification of ADAMTS-13 level and other coagulation variables (e.g. FVIII, VWF:Ag/VWF:act) in cirrhotic patients during 18 months from the enrolment and to verify their predictive role as biomarker of development of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) Secondary Objectives To describe prospectively the modification of ADAMTS-13 level as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis Statistical analysis The total duration of the study will be of 12 months. The sample size of 200 subjects will be selected as a feasible number of patients to be recruited in a period of six months. The patients will be consecutively enrolled and followed for 18 months. As a result, in a follow up period of 18 months about 20-25 cases of PVT are expected. Continuous variables will be expressed as means ñ standard deviations. In addition to descriptive statistics (location parameters), univariate analysis will be performed on each parameter and development of PVT during the follow up period. In previous observational studies both 1) a reduced PV flow \[prospectively\] and 2) a reduction of ADAMTS-13 are significantly associated with PVT. These associations will be investigated prospectively and analyzed simultaneously by a multivariate analysis and ROC curve to establish the sensitivity and specificity of these parameters as predictors of PVT development. Analyses will be performed using available data Detailed Description BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION The occurrence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) radically changes the prognosis of cirrhotic patients, particularly those awaiting liver transplantation. If this happens, it occurs in about 8-10% / year in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation. Some studies have suggested the involvement of various risk factors for the development of PVT in cirrhotic patients, including the classic congenital and acquired thrombophilic conditions \[1-6\], although contributions of our research group have shown that a key element in the development of PVT in these patients is the decreased velocity of portal blood flow \[7, 8\]. The possible contribution of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and ADAMTS-13, produced by the liver stellate cells \[9\], for the development of PVT is rather poorly documented. In a recent observational study of the proponent \[10\], conducted on 84 patients with liver cirrhosis, it was found that the level of circulating ADAMTS-13 is significantly lower in the group with PVT (median = 16.8% vs. 69.1%, p = 0.0047) and independently associated with the presence of portal thrombosis (p = 0.007). However, given the non-longitudinal nature of the study, it is possible that the decreased level of ADAMTS-13 observed is the consequence and not the cause of PVT. It is also yet to investigate the association of ADAMTS-13 level with the specific etiology of cirrhosis (viral, alcoholic, idiopathic, etc.) and the resulting inflammation during the course of the disease. Duration of Study Period(s) and Subject Participation Two hundred (200) patients, consecutively enrolled in a period of about 6 months, will be followed for 18 months from the enrolment. As a result, in the subsequent 18 months about 20-25 cases of PVT will be expected. All patients will sign an informed consent. The severity of liver function failure will be assessed using the Child-Pugh score \[11\]. Primary Endpoint To describe in a prospective way the association of both basal ADAMTS-13 level and portal vein flow with development of PVT in cirrhotic patients during 18 months from the enrolment. Secondary Endpoints To describe prospectively the modification of ADAMTS-13 level as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis Coagulation and biochemical parameters The prospective study will measure the following biochemical and coagulation parameters at each follow-up visit, scheduled at interval of 4 months according to routine controls: Coagulation and thrombophilia factors All blood samples will be drawn under fasting conditions in the morning. Determinations of PT, APTT, fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C, protein S, lupus anticoagulant, FVIII (two-stage chromogenic assay) and D-dimer will be carried out on an automatic coagulometer (ACL Top 700, IL). VWF-antigen VWF:activity will be measured in plasma samples by chemiluminescence assays. VWF multimer (VWFm) pattern was measured as previously reported \[10\]. FV Leiden R506Q and prothrombin G20210A genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed by using commercial kits based on PCR-RT-based method (from EliTechGroup S.p.A., Torino, Italy) on an automatic instrument (Model 7300, Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Measurement of ADAMTS-13 activity. ADAMTS-13 activity was measured in citrated plasma samples by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay using a VWF86 amino-acid peptide substrate contained in a commercial kit from Instrumentation Laboratory (ADAMTS-13 activity, Werfen Group, Milano, Italy) and a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorometer, as previously detailed \[10, 13\] and expressed as % of normal plasma. Clinical Chemistry assays. All clinical chemistry assays (plasma albumin, creatinine, alanine-leucine-amino-transferase (ALT) and total bilirubin) will be performed as a part of routine diagnostic work-up within 24 hours of clinical observation in the central laboratory of the ""A. Gemelli"" Hospital, using heparinized plasma samples and commercial reagents from Siemens. Secondary objectives. The secondary objectives of analyzing the levels of ADAMTS-13 and VWF as a function of the etiology of cirrhosis will be further assessed only after a certified diagnosis of the particular etiologic of cirrhosis. In the case of HCV-associated cirrhosis also the genotype of HCV will be analyzed. Informed Consent and Enrollment Any patient who will provide informed consent (i.e., signs and dates the informed consent form and assent form, if applicable) and will meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered enrolled in the study. Subject Identification Code. The following series of numbers will comprise the subject identification code (SIC): protocol acronym (ADAPTHRO), and 2-digit subject number (e.g., 01....02) reflecting the order of enrollment (i.e., signing the informed consent form). For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form will be identified as ADAPTHRO-03. All study documents (e.g., CRFs, clinical documentation, etc.) will be identified with the SIC. Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome. Subject Completion/Discontinuation A subject is considered to have completed the study when he/she ceases active participation in the study because the subject has, or is presumed to have, completed the study according to the protocol, participated for the specified observational time and when the study exit form has been completed. Reasons for completion/discontinuation will be reported on the Completion/ Discontinuation CRF page, including: completed, screen failure, adverse event (e.g., death), discontinuation by subject (e.g., lost to follow-up \[defined as 3 documented unsuccessful attempts to contact the subject\], dropout), physician decision (e.g., pregnancy, progressive disease, protocol violation(s)), Vital Signs Vital signs will include height (cm) and weight (kg). Height and weight will be collected, if available, at screening visit, each annual interval visit, and study completion/termination. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Planned Statistical Analysis Continuous variables will be expressed as means ñ standard deviations. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Fisher's exact tests and/or Chi-Square tests will be mainly used to compare qualitative variables and Student's t-test for quantitative unpaired data. A p-value \< 0.05 will be considered statistically significant in an exploratory sense. In addition to descriptive statistics (location parameters), and univariate analysis, multivariate analyses are planned. Independent variables that will be found associated with PVT in univariate analysis with p\<0.05 will be used as independent covariates associated with PVT in the next 18 months in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. A two-sided p \<0.05 was defined as statistically significant. Analyses will be performed using SPSS software (version 21, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA). Informed Consent. Investigators will choose patients for enrollment based on the study eligibility criteria.The investigator will exercise no selectivity so that no bias is introduced from this source. All patients must sign an informed consent form before entering into the study according to applicable regulatory requirements. Before use, the informed consent form will be reviewed by the EC. By signing the informed consent form, patients agree to take part in the study. Confidentiality Policy The investigator will comply with the confidentiality policy as described in the Non- Interventional Trial Agreement. Study Documents and Case Report Forms The investigator will maintain complete and accurate study documentation in a separate file. Documentation may include medical records, records detailing the progress of the study for each subject, signed informed consent forms, correspondence with the EC, enrollment and screening information, CRFs and laboratory reports. The investigator will comply with the procedures for data recording and reporting. Document and Data Retention The investigator will retain study documentation and data in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the document and data retention policy, as described in the Non-Interventional Study Agreement.",Embase,,
325,EM-181,Di et al. (2017),2017,Role of the ADAMTS13/VWF complex in the thrombotic and bleeding events of 67 Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia prospectively observed for 36 months,"Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) may have thrombotic and bleeding complications with increasing morbidity and mortality. Age, previous history of thrombosis, elevated white cell counts and JAK2 allele burden are considered risk factors for both arterial (ATE) and venous (VTE) thrombosis while elevated platelet counts and quantitative/qualitative defects of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) are associated with bleeds. To evaluate the role of the complex ADAMTS13/VWF in thrombosis and bleeds, 67 patients with ET diagnosed according to WHO criteria have been observed prospectively for thrombotic and bleeding events during a 36-month follow-up. Patients enrolled (n=67) were exposed to the diagnostic tests needed to characterize ET but signed an informed consent for these ADAMTS13/VWF evaluations. VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag) activities were measured by the automatic ACL-TOP systems while ADAMTS-13 was tested by TECH-NOZYM activity ELISA. These data were expressed versus International Standard in IU/dL. The VWF:RCo/Ag ratios were calculated as surrogate marker for the loss of the HMW-VWF multimers but such VWF defect were also confirmed using agarose-gel electrophoresis. Statistical analyses among the cases with or without complications were performed by SPSS. Thrombotic [ATE(7), VTE(10)] and bleeding [Menorrhagia(4), Epistaxis(4), Gastrointestinal(2)] complications were observed in 17/67(25%) ET-T and 10/67(15%) ET-B cases respectively while 40/67(60%) ET patients did show no thrombotic/bleeding events (ET-NTB). The clinical-lab data [median(range) of ET-T or ET-B were compared with those found in ET-NTB. Age, sex, JAK2 allele burden and white cell counts were not different (p=0.18) among the 3 groups. In ET-T(n=17), VWF:ACT(U/dL) was higher [162(96-209)] than that of ET-NTB[109(76-239)] with ADAMTS13(U/dL) lower [65(41-142)] than that of ET-NTB [87(56-164)]with p<0.05. In ET-B(n=10), Plt-counts(/uL) were higher [722(478-1342) than those with ET-NTB[464(390-830) with VWF:ACT(U/dL) lower [53(27-92)] than that of ET-NTB (p<0.05). In ET-B, there was also a loss of the HMW-VWF multimers assessed by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis in most cases as predicted by VWF:ACT/Ag ratios <0.6. ADAMTS13 levels [85(50-154) were not different from ET-NTB. Based on these results from a relatively small number but well characterized patients, we can suggest that the ADAMTS13/VWF complex might be considered an additional risk factor to predict thrombotic or bleeding events in ET.",Embase,,

(2017),2017,Auditing massive transfusion protocol,"Background/Case Studies: A large Midwest hospital system with 5 Level I trauma sites evaluated how to audit the Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP). The possibility of real time audits is impractical due to the unpredictability of these events. A search of the internet found an example from New Zealand for post process evaluation. This was shared with a team as a starting point and then adjusted for system specific priorities. To start the audit, the initiation of the MTP needed to be determined as events are often started as a verbal request but then followed up with either downtime or computer orders. Study Design/Method: The Transfusion Service (TS) was determined to be the source of truth for all of the MTP events. A tracking sheet was created to capture the patient demographics, start and stop time, number and type of products issued and wastage. This was then passed onto nursing quality staff that used the tracking form and the patient chart to enter an event into the error management data base as a focused event. The focused event was built to include patient demographics and other information from the tracking form as well as where the event was called (Surgery (OR), Emergency (ED), Labor and Delivery (L&D), etc.), type of event, use of tranexamic acid (TXA), calcium chloride (CaCl), temperature monitoring and pre/ post lab results. A trial was started and 3 months of data were evaluated that contained 29 events. Results/Finding: There was an equal number of events that were initiated in the ED and the OR (12). Male patients were involved 69% of the time and 31% of time the patients expired. Trauma of some type was the majority of the cause but 13.8% of the cases involved GI Bleed and only 6.9% were obstetric cases (see chart). The lowest hemoglobin (Hgb) was found to average 7.1 with the post Hgb average of 9.7. Ratios of 1:1 for Red Blood Cells (RBC) to plasma as well as RBC to Platelets (PLT) and Cryoprecipitate (CRYO) were also determined with a target of 4:1. It was found that the RBC: plasma was 1.9:1, RBC: PLT was 5.9:1 and RBC to CRYO was 7.4:1. Use of TXA was only 24.1% and CaCl was utilized in 58.6% of cases. Conclusion: Although this data is for a short period of time it has pointed out several opportunities for improvement. The use of MTP in GI cases was not previously understood but opens up a new group of people for which education and understanding of the MTP process is needed. The low use of TXA needs to be evaluated and already has started conversations about how this drug should be stored and accessed for the MTP process. The product ratio numbers were suspected of being off but now that data is available, it is much easier to speak to this issue and look for improvement. The process will now be expanded to the Level II trauma sites in the system and routine evaluation will be shared with all sites.",Embase,10.1111/trf.14286,

(2017),2017,Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral 1/2 peroneus longus tendon,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a commonly sport-induced knee joint injury that does serious harm to the knee stability. ACL reconstruction is a commonly used treatment method, but researches on 1/2 peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft are rarely reported. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of removing the autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT under arthroscopy for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: 106 patients with complete ACL rupture in the Affiliated Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southwest Medical University from December 2010 to December 2014 were enrolled, and autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT was removed under arthroscopy for ACL reconstruction. At baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, the knee stability was evaluated manually through the anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test, and the knee function was evaluated by Tegner activity scale, Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test tests were negative in all patients. In terms of Tegner activity scale, Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores, there were significant differences at baseline and postoperative 3 months as compared with postoperative 6 months (P < 0.05); the scores at baseline and postoperative 3 months showed significant differences compared with 12 months postoperatively (P < 0.05); the scores showed no significant difference between 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P > 0.05). These results indicate that autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT is a good choice for ACL reconstruction under arthroscopy, achieving rapid and satisfactory functional recovery of the knee joint, which is not only minimally invasive and easy to operate, but also exhibits good therapeutic efficacy.",Embase,10.3969/j.issn.2095-4344.2017.24.008,
328,EM-184,Russell et al. (2017),2017,Baseline cartilage quality is associated with voxel-based T(1?) and T(2) following ACL reconstruction: A multicenter pilot study,"In this multi-center study, voxel-based relaxometry (VBR), a novel technique to automatically quantify localized cartilage change, was used to investigate T1? and T2 relaxation times of patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears at the time of injury and 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Sixty-four ACL-injured patients from three sites underwent bilateral 3T MR T1? and T2 mapping; 56 patients returned 6 months after surgery. Cross-sectional and longitudinal VBR comparisons of relaxation times were calculated. Noyes Score (NS) clinical grades of cartilage lesions were noted at both times and correlated with relaxation times. Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T1? times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T1? increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T1? and T2 after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the speed and localized specificity of automatic VBR analysis may translate well for clinical application, as seen in this multicenter study. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

329,EM-185,Palmer et al. (2017),2017,A Biomechanical Comparison of Allograft Tendons for Ligament Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Allograft tendons are frequently used for ligament reconstruction about the knee, but they entail availability and cost challenges. The identification of other tissues that demonstrate equivalent performance to preferred tendons would improve limitations. Hypothesis/Purpose: We compared the biomechanical properties of 4 soft tissue allograft tendons: tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), and semitendinosus (ST). We hypothesized that allograft properties would be similar when standardized by the looped diameter. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: This study consisted of 2 arms evaluating large and small looped-diameter grafts: experiment A consisted of TA, TP, and PL tendons (n = 47 each) with larger looped diameters of 9.0 to 9.5 mm, and experiment B consisted of TA, TP, PL, and ST tendons (n = 53 each) with smaller looped diameters of 7.0 to 7.5 mm. Each specimen underwent mechanical testing to measure the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile force (UTF), maximal elongation at failure, ultimate tensile stress (UTS), and ultimate tensile strain (UTî). RESULTS: Experiment A: No significant differences were noted among tendons for UTF, maximal elongation at failure, and UT?. UTS was significantly higher for the PL (54 MPa) compared with the TA (44 MPa) and TP (43 MPa) tendons. E was significantly higher for the PL (501 MPa) compared with the TP (416 MPa) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TP and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the TA tendons for all outcomes. Experiment B: All groups exhibited a similar E. UTF was again highest in the PL tendons (2294 N) but was significantly different from only the ST tendons (1915 N). UT? was significantly higher for the ST (0.22) compared with the TA (0.19) and TP (0.19) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TA, TP, and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the ST tendons. CONCLUSION: Compared with TA tendons, TP and PL tendons of a given looped diameter exhibited noninferior initial biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics. ST tendons were mostly similar to TA tendons but exhibited a significantly higher elongation/UT? and smaller cross-sectional area. For smaller looped-diameter grafts, all tissues were noninferior to ST tendons. In contrast to previous findings, PL tendons proved to be equally strong. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this study should encourage surgeons to use these soft tissue allografts interchangeably, which is important as the number of ligament reconstructions performed with allografts continues to rise.",Embase,10.1177/0363546516671944,
330,EM-186,Moatshe et al. (2017),2017,Multiple Ligament Reconstruction Femoral Tunnels: Intertunnel Relationships and Guidelines to Avoid Convergence,"BACKGROUND: Knee dislocations often require multiple concurrent ligament reconstructions, which involve creating several tunnels in the distal femur. Therefore, the risk of tunnel convergence is increased because of the limited bone volume within the distal aspect of the femur. PURPOSE: To assess the risk of tunnel convergence and determine the optimal reconstruction tunnel orientations for multiple ligament reconstructions in the femur. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Three-dimensional knee models were developed from computed tomography scans of 21 patients. Medical image processing software was used to create tunnels for each of the primary ligamentous structures, replicating a surgical approach that would be used in multiple ligament reconstructions. Thereafter, the tunnel orientation was varied in surgically relevant directions to determine orientations that minimized the risk of tunnel convergence. The orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tunnels was held constant throughout the study, while the orientation of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL) tunnels was varied to avoid convergence. RESULTS: A high risk of tunnel convergence was observed between the FCL and ACL tunnels when the FCL tunnel was aimed at 0ø in the axial and coronal planes. Aiming the FCL tunnel 35ø anteriorly minimized convergence with the ACL tunnel. No tunnel convergence was observed for the PLT tunnel aimed 35ø anteriorly and parallel to the FCL tunnel. To avoid convergence between the sMCL and PCL tunnels, the sMCL tunnels should be aimed 40ø proximally in the coronal plane and 20ø to 40ø anteriorly. During concomitant POL reconstruction, the sMCL should be aimed 40ø proximally and anteriorly and the POL 20ø proximally and anteriorly. The PLT and POL tunnels aimed at 0ø in both the coronal and axial planes had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CONCLUSION: Femoral tunnel orientations during multiple ligament reconstructions need to be adjusted to avoid tunnel convergence. On the lateral side, aiming the FCL and PLT tunnels 35ø anteriorly eliminated convergence with the ACL tunnel. On the medial side, tunnel convergence was avoided by orienting the sMCL tunnel 40ø proximally and anteriorly and the POL tunnel 20ø proximally and anteriorly. The POL and PLT tunnels aimed at 0ø in the axial plane had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The risk of tunnel convergence with the ACL and PCL femoral tunnels can be reduced by adjusting the orientation of the FCL and PLT tunnels and the sMCL and POL tunnels, respectively.",Embase,10.1177/0363546516673616,
331,EM-187,Vap et al. (2017),2017,Internal and external rotation stabilizers of the knee with intact cruciate and collateral ligaments: A biomechanical study,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of sequentially cutting the posterolateral, anterolateral, posteromedial and anteromedial structures of the knee on rotational kinematics in the setting of intact cruciate and collateral ligaments. It was hypothesized that cutting of the iliotibial band (ITB), anterolateral ligament and lateral capsule (ALL/LC), the posterior oblique ligament (POL), and the posteromedial capsule (PMC) would significantly increase internal rotation and that the anteromedial capsule (AMC), and the popliteus tendon and popliteofibular ligament (PLT/PFL) when sectioned would lead to a significant increase in external rotation of the knee. Methods: Ten pairs (n = 20) of cadaveric knees were assigned to two sequential cutting groups (posterolateral-toposteromedial and posteromedial-to-posterolateral). Specimen were subjected to 5 N-m of internal and external rotation torque at knee flexion angles 0ø through 90ø in the intact and after each cut state. Rotational changes were measured and compared to the intact and previous states following each cut. Results: Sectioning of the ITB significantly increased internal rotation at 60ø and 90ø by 5.4ø and 6.2[[Unsupported Character - Codename í]]ø, respectively (after ALL/LC cut) and 3.5ø and 3.8ø (prior to ALL/LC cut) (Figure 1). At 60ø and 90ø, section of the ALL/LC produced significant increases in internal rotation of 3.1[[Unsupported Character - Codename í]]ø and 3.5ø, respectively (after ITB cut) and of 0.5ø (prior to ITB cut) (Figure 1). At 0ø, section of the POL produced significant increases in internal rotation of 2.0ø (ITB intact) and 1.8ø (after ITB cut) (Figure 1). Sectioning the PLT/PFL complex significantly increased external rotation at 60ø and 90ø by 2.7ø and 2.9ø, respectively (prior to sectioning medial structures) and 2.2ø and 2.7[[Unsupported Character - Codename í]]ø, respectively (after sectioning medial structures) (Figure 2). Sectioning the AMC produced significant increases in external rotation at 30ø- 90ø of flexion, however the magnitude of change was < 1ø (Figure 2). Conclusion: Collectively the anterolateral corner structures had a primary role in internal rotational control of the knee from 60ø to 90ø of knee flexion. The ITB was the most significant primary stabilizer for internal rotation in ACL intact knees. The POL contributed to internal rotational control at full extension, while the PLT/PFL complex controlled external rotation of the knee at higher flexion angles (60ø and 90ø). Internal rotation control of the knee has been mainly attributed to the cruciate and collateral ligaments. This study delineates the primary and secondary roles of the ITB, the ALL/LC, POL and PLT/PFL to rotatory stability of the knee. As such, it provides new information about the understanding of rotational instabilities of the knee. (Figure Presented).",Embase,10.1177/2325967117S00129,

Methods: Achilles, quadriceps, semitendinosus + gracilis (STG), tibialis anterior (TA) and the peroneus longus (PL) were harvested from 30 donors. Group A contained 50 tendons without gamma irradiation. The groups were irradiated with a dose of 21 kGy (group B 50 tendons) and with a dose of 42 kGy (group C 50 tendons). The grafts were soaked in a radio-protectant solution and frozen at ?80 øC. Cyclic loading tests were performed followed by load to failure tests. Young modulus of elasticity, maximum force, strain at tensile strength and strain at rupture were calculated. Results: The Achilles tendons had significantly lower Young modulus than the TA (p = 0.0036) in group A. The Achilles showed significantly lower than PL (p = 0.000042) and TA (p = 0.00142) in group B and C. The quadriceps and the ST (p = 0.0037) provided poorer values than the TA (p = 0.0432) in group C. We found no difference in maximum loads among the tendons in group A. The maximum load of the Achilles and quadriceps showed better results than the PL (p = 0.0016), (p = 0.0018) and the STG (p = 0.0066), (p = 0.0019) in group C. The TA had similar results like the Achilles and quadriceps.

All patients in the autograft group were male and only three patients in the allograft group were female. The mean age in the autograft group was 29,60ñ4,55 and 34,25ñ6,73 in the allograft group. The mean time period before the surgery was 10,35(1-84) months and the mean postoperative follow up time was 33,8(12-46) months. Only 2 patients in the autograft group and 4 patients in the allograft group were injured by direct trauma. We noted the patients' occupation, activity level and sport activities. Joint effusion, pain and restriction in the joint motion were documented. Patients were evaluated with Lachman, anterior drawer and pivot shift tests at the last follow up examination. The joint instability was tested with KT 1000 and the muscle contractions were tested with Cybex devices. Modified Cincinnati, Lysholm and IKDC activity scale were used to evaluate the activity level of patients. There were no difference neither clinically, nor functionally between two groups at the last follow up (p>0,05).

According to data in the general population, the incidence rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury was 1:3500. The treatment option of ACL injury cases include physical exercise and reconstruction surgery. Graft options for the ACL reconstruction include:autograft and allograft. One of the most popular autograft is hamstring. The use of hamstrings in ACL reconstruction still arguing among the expert. The choice of autograft that can be chosen as a new alternative is the peroneus longus tendon. Currently, there is very few biomechanical study on peroneus longus strength as an alternative choice of autograft in ACL reconstruction. The study to determine the tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon was conducted by the researcher as a preliminary study that could bring new perspective for future studies. Materials and methods This is an experimental research. Six human cadaveric specimens as research material. Each cadaver was treated by taking hamstring and peroneus from both lower limbs. The hamstring and peroneal tendons were then measured by applying the Hydraulic Servo Pulser tensile test apparatus. Data on tensile strength comparison between peroneal tendon and hamstring were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. Result From the measurement results, it is known that hamstring has lower average tensile strength value compared to peroneus without significant difference (p > 0.05). Conclusion The tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon, which is similar to that of hamstring, gives information that both have the same biomechanic properties. Peroneus longus should not be used as a first option in ACL reconstruction, but may be used as an alternative donor in cases involving multiple instability that require more tendon donors in the reconstruction.",Embase,10.1016/j.ijso.2017.10.002,
336,EM-192,Estermann et al. (2016),2016,Anticipated muscular synchronization between walking on flat and cross-sloped surface,"Introduction: Movement and muscular adaptations are necessary to perform our daily activities. These adaptations are often done automatically, like varying the walking movement while passing different surface conditions (e.g. smooth-rough, soft hard) or also a cross-sloped surface. Therefore we anticipate our muscular activation pattern with a slightly alternation to accomplish the movement task in an appropriated way, that may increase safety or performance. The goal of this study was to analyse the anticipated muscular activity and the inter-muscular synchronization while walking barefoot on flat and cross-sloped surface within each and overall subjects. Research question: Is there a temporal shift in the muscular synchronisation while walking on flat or cross-sloped surface? Methods: A 3D-gait-analysis (Vicon, 12 Cameras T20) with a synchronous surface electromyogram (EMG) (Myon, 2400 Hz) of the right leg muscles: Tibialis anterior (TA), Peroneus longus (PL), Gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and lateralis (GL), Vastus medialis (VM) and lateralis (VL), Rectus femoris (RF), Semitendinosus (ST) and Biceps femoris (BF) was done. 10 subjects (f, 22-25y) walked at a self-selected speed on flat and cross-sloped surface (6ø). 10 trials of each condition and surface were measured: flat, cross-slope upside- leg, cross-slope down-side-leg. The time was normalised over a gait-cycle, the averaged kinematic data and the normalized Wavelet-Transformed-EMG Total-Intensity (Itot) of the wavelets 5 to 8 with the centre frequencies: 92; 128; 170 and 218 Hz were analysed within a gait cycle for each subject and overall subjects while walking on the different conditions. Results: The results show a significant difference in the stancephase for the knee flexion and ankle dorsi-flexion between the conditions flat and cross-slope down-side-leg as well as for crossslope up-side-leg and down-side-leg for all 10 subjects. The overall mid-stance muscular adaption of one representative subject show e.g. on the flat surface is the GM-ItotMAX 2.4% before the GL-ItotMAX, while for the cross-slope up-side-leg condition GM-ItotMAX is 0.3% ahead of the GL-ItotMAX. The results overall subjects show that GM-I ItotMAX is significant earlier than GM-I ItotMAX: 1.8% (SD: 1.6%, p: 0.016) on the flat surface and 3% (SD: 2.4%, p: 0.016) for the cross-slope down-side leg. There is no significance shift for the cross-slope up-side-leg with 2% (SD: 2.5%, p: 0.081) between GM-I ItotMAX and GM-I ItotMAX. The intramuscular temporal shifts between the 3 conditions are for the GM-I ItotMAX in the cross-slope up-sideleg 1.3% (SD: 2.5%, p: 0.26) and down-side-leg 1.7% (SD: 2.8%, p: 0.19) earlier than on flat surface, and the GL-ItotMAX is in the upside- leg 1.1% (SD: 2.0%, p: 0.91) and the down-side-leg 0.5% (SD: 1.9% p: 0.41) earlier than on the flat surface. Discussion: The results show that the movement, even with small changes in the surface condition lead to a detectable in the kinematic and muscular activation pattern. The variation in the surface requires also a new synchronisation pattern of the muscular interplay similar as Wakeling [1] showed with the muscle tuning by varying the shoe elasticity. These optimising processes may be performed by a feed-forward controlling system and can there fore be seenas an anticipated muscular synchronization. This is necessary in adjusting our neuromuscular activity pattern in daily movement tasks. Further, the measured time shifts of the ItotMAX between the 3 conditions were small. A range of 1% corresponds to about 8 to 10 ms for the measured gait-cycle time of approximate 0.8-1 s. Although it is known that small neuromuscular changes may lead e.g. to Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome due to a delayed onset of the VM vs. VL [2,3], or increase the risk of ACL-Ruptures [4] due to a different muscular activation pattern of the ST. However neuromuscular training may increase the ability in anticipated muscular synchronization, which reduces the risk of injuries dramatically [5,6] and increases the performance in sport [7]. Therefore the anticipated muscular synchronization is an important aspect of neuromotor control in daily activities.",Embase,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2016.07.124,

Design: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1? and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1? or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1? or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. Results: Higher baseline SSD T1? posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1? pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year. Conclusion: T1? and T2 of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS after injury and both KOOS and Marx after reconstruction. Such associations may help clinicians stratify outcomes post-injury, and thus, improve patient management.",Embase,10.1016/j.joca.2016.01.985,

(2016),2016,A matched-pair comparison of patient reported outcomes following primary ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft vs hybrid graft,"Introduction: With the relatively recent introduction of hybrid autograft-allograft grafts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), few studies have compared outcomes between autografts versus hybrid grafts. The purpose of this study is to compare patient-rated outcomes between hamstring autografts and hybrid grafts for ACLR. Methods: At a minimum two-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with hamstring autograft (A) or hybrid (H) graft (hamstring autograft with peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective IKDC score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), SF- 12, and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up. A matched-pair analysis was performed by matching patients in each group by gender and by age at the time of surgery within three years. Paired t-tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. Results: Twenty matched-pairs were formed, including nine males and eleven females in each group. Average age at surgery was 34 years (range, 13-57 years). Average follow-up was 3.3 years. No significant differences were found in any of the KOOS subscale scores, Subjective IKDC (A: 75, H: 77), SANE (A: 86, H: 90), SF-12 Physical (A: 53, H: 53) or Mental (A: 53, H: 52) component scores, or activity level prior to injury (A: 7.5, H: 7.4) or at time of follow-up (A: 6.7, H: 6.2). Conclusion: Patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction with a hybrid graft (hamstring autograft plus allograft) have similar subjective outcomes to those with a hamstring autograft. Further studies are needed to determine patient characteristics which favor the use of hybrid grafts.",Embase,10.1016/j.arthro.2016.03.044,
339,EM-195,Li et al. (2016),2016,Severity of ACL injury affects functional performance 2 years after surgery,"Purpose: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury results in instability of the knee joint and early onset of osteoarthritis (OA) in more than half of the injured patients. This deterioration of cartilage can be monitored using quantitative MR, specifically T1? and T2. Immediately following injury, elevated T1? and T2 have been found in cartilage of the posterolateral tibia (pLT); this can be interpreted as an indicator of injury severity because the pivot shift injury mechanism results in the impaction of the lateral femoral condyle against the posterolateral tibial plateau. Additionally, postural stability and isokinetic strength may be decreased despite reconstruction's partial restoration of kinematics; however, these two pathologies have not been studied concurrently. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional performance of ACL reconstructed knees at one and two years after surgery, its relationship to the severity of injury and its association with T1? and T2 relaxation times. Methods: 29 patients (Age= 30.8 ñ 8.2 years, BMI = 23.62 ñ 2.82 kg/ m2, 16 females) with acute unilateral ACL tears and no previous history of knee trauma or disease were recruited prior to surgery (i.e. baseline). Patients were scanned at baseline (BL), 1 year (1Y) and 2 year (2Y) follow-ups using a 3T MR scanner to acquire sagittal high resolution 3D fast spin-echo imaging (CUBE) and T1? and T2 sequences. Cartilage was segmented semi-automatically on CUBE images into six compartments [lateral femoral condyle, lateral tibia, medial femoral condyle, medial tibia, trochlea and patella], and further divided into 14 subcompartments. Functional performance was evaluated using the commercially available Y-Balance Test (YBT), single leg hop test for distance (SHD) and timed 6-meter hop test for both injured and contralateral (contra) knees. Performance values were obtained by averaging three trials for each assessment. Paired t-test was used to compare functional performance of injured and contra sides at 1Y and 2Y, and also to compare between 1Y and 2Y. Partial correlations controlling for age, gender, BMI and leg length determined whether BL T1? and T2 in the pLT, interpreted as an indicator of severity of injury, predicts functional performance at 2Y. Partial correlations were also used to determine cross-sectional correlations between functional performance and T1? and T2, and also to evaluate if functional performance at 1Y longitudinally affected T1? and T2 at 2Y. Significance was defined as p<0.05. Results: There was no significant difference in YBT performance between injured and contra sides at 1Y and 2Y, as well as between 1Y and 2Y. SHD on the injured side was significantly lower than contra at 1Y and 2Y (Figure 1A) (p<0.01). Timed 6-meter hop was significantly slower for the injured knee at 1Y (p<0.01), but not at 2Y (Figure 1B). No significant associations were identified between 2Y T1? and T2 with YBT, SHD, or timed 6-meter hop at 2Y or 1Y. Higher T1? and T2 in the pLT of the injured knee at BL was associated with decreased YBT distance in all three directions of both knees (Figure 2) (p<0.05, R=-0.427). There was no association between 1Y functional performance with 2Y T1? or T2. Conclusions: The lack of significance between injured and contra 1Y and 2Y YBT performance suggests recovery of postural stability; however, the injured sides' significantly decreased SHD at 1Y and 2Y and slower 6-meter hop at 1Y may be due to deficiency in strength and confidence in the affected limb. Although there is no significant difference between injured and contra sides of YBT as a group, there are individual variations, and BL T1? and T2 in pLT was correlated with YBT at 2Y. Because the pLT is a region of cartilage damaged by the pivoting mechanism during initial injury, the negative correlation between BL T1? and T2 in the pLT and YBT performance suggests that injury severity may affect postural stability at 2Y; this altered function may suggest abnormal kinematics in the knee joint and lead to long-term OA. Interestingly, we found similar correlations between T1? and T2 and YBT in the contra side as well, suggesting potential adaption of the uninjured side. Our next steps include using additional 2Y follow-ups to further assess long-term functional performance's relationship with BL T1p and T2, as well as its relationship with biomechanical data and patient report outcomes.

From 8 human cadavers, 40 grafts were collected. We removed the bone-patella tendon-bone grafts, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, the quadriceps tendon-bone grafts, the Achilles tendons, and the peroneus longus tendons from each lower extremity. We tested the tendon grafts with five different types of fixation devices: surgical thread (Premicron 3), general mounting clamp, wire mesh, cement fixation, and a modified clamp for an INSTRON loading machine. The mean failure load in case of surgical thread fixation was (381N ñ 26N). The results with the general clamp were (527N ñ 45N). The wire meshes were more promising (750N ñ 21N), but did not reach the outcomes we desired. Easy slippages of the ends of the tendons from the cement encasements were observed (253N ñ 18N). We then began to use Shi's clamp that could produce 977N ñ 416N peak force. We combined Shi's clamp with freezing of the graft and the rupture of the tendon itself demonstrated an average force of 2198 N ñ 773N. We determined that our modified frozen clamp fixed the specimens against high tensile forces.",Embase,10.1556/036.103.2016.1.8,
341,EM-197,Lord et al. (2016),2016,Biomechanical evaluation of human allograft compression in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Introduction: A common problem encountered during ACL reconstruction is asymmetry of proximal-distal graft diameter leading to tunnel upsizing and potential graft-tunnel mismatch. Human allografts are often oedematous, compounding this issue in the context of multi-ligament reconstructions. Tunnel upsizing reduces bone stock, increases the complexity of multi-bundle surgery and may compromise graft-osseous integration if cortical suspensory fixation is used. Graft compression provides uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel, potentially improving the 'press-fit' graft-osseous interaction whilst preserving bone stock. To our knowledge, no biomechanical evaluation of this increasing popular technique has been reported. Hypotheses: Graft compression would not cause any significant changes in the biomechanical properties of human allograft tendon that would be detrimental to the function of an ACL reconstruction. Compressed Bioclense? allograft will increase in size when soaked in Ringer's solution at 36ø improving the 'press-fit' within the bone socket, decreasing micro-motion at the graft-osseous interface following ACL reconstruction. Method: In-vitro laboratory study. Sixteen samples of Bioclense? treated peroneus longus allograft were quadrupled into GraftLink constructs randomly divided into control and compressed groups. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined using alginate moulds and specimens immersed, under tension, in Ringer's solution at 36.5ø. CSA was measured at 8 hours. A further 32 samples were randomised and evaluated under cyclic loading of 70N-220N (1020 cycles) followed by test to failure. A further 30 samples were quadrupled into GraftLink constructs and mounted within porcine femurs using suspensory fixation. High resolution videometer recorded motion at the graft-osseous interface under the same cyclic loading protocol. An independent samples t-test was used to compare changes in CSA whilst a one-way ANOVA was used for biomechanical end points. Results: CSA increased by 1.2 ñ 0.04% and 16 ñ 0.07% in control and compressed groups during joint simulation (P<0.05). Cyclic creep was 0.62 ñ 1.22mm and 1.75 ñ 0.97 (P>0.05), the Young's moduli were 617 ñ 172 MPa and 708 ñ 219 MPa (P>0.05) and ultimate tensile strength 85.2 ñ 27.4 MPa and 89 ñ 25.3 MPa (P>0.05) for the control and compressed groups respectively. Initial samples (n=4) show amplitude of cyclic motion of control and compressed ACL grafts in situ were 2.1mm (ñ0.6) and 1.9mm (ñ0.7) for control and compressed groups respectively. Conclusions: The process of graft compression does not have any detrimental effects upon Bioclense? treated allograft tendons. Following graft compression, these tendons significantly increase in size during intra-articular simulation promoting a 'press-fit' within the bone socket. Graft compression may significantly decrease micromotion at the graft-osseous interface with further testing.",Embase,10.1177/2325967116S00023,

It was the study objective to evaluate the impact of baseline lupus anticoagulant assays, IgG anticardiolipin (aCL), plasma fibrinogen (FNG) and von Willebrand factor (VWF), platelets (PLT) and of genetic polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, of prothrombin G20210A and of paraoxonase-1 Q192R on survival in primary APS (PAPS). Cohort study on 77 thrombotic PAPS and 33 asymptomatic carriers of aPL (PCaPL) seen from 1989 to 2015 and persistently positive for aPL as per annual review. At baseline all participants were tested twice for the ratios of kaolin clotting time (KCTr), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTTr), dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVTr), IgG aCL, FNG, VWF and once for PLT. All thrombotic PAPS were on warfarin with regular INR monitoring. During follow-up 11 PAPS deceased (D-PAPS) of recurrent thrombosis mostly arterial, despite adequate anticoagulation yielding an overall vascular mortality of 10 %. D-PAPS had the strongest baseline aPTTr and DRVVTr and the highest mean baseline IgG aCL, FNG, VWF and PLT. Cox proportional hazards model identified baseline DRVVTr and FNG as main predictors of mortality with adjusted hazard ratios of 5.75 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 22.4) and of 1.03 (95 %CI: 1.01, 1.04), respectively. In conclusion, plasma DRVVTr and FNG are strongly associated with the risk of vascular death in PAPS; while FNG lowering agents exist further research should be directed at therapeutic strategies able to dampen aPL production.",Embase,10.1160/TH15-10-0839,
343,EM-199,Gali et al. (2016),2016,Tunnel collision during simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner reconstruction,"PURPOSE: To verify the safest angle to drill femoral tunnels in simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstructions to minimize the risk of tunnel collision and to examine the relationship between lateral femoral condyle (LFC) width and tunnel collision occurrence. METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulations and 10ø axial/30ø coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. RESULTS: Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10ø axial/30ø coronal angulation (P < 0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater.",Embase,10.1007/s00167-014-3363-0,

Human plasma can be obtained by plasmapheresis or recovered plasma from whole blood donation. The quality of the plasma is important for the fractionation process. Aim: To evaluate the quality of source and recovered plasma for fractionation. Materials and methods: Donors fulfilling current national and European eligibility criteria underwent whole blood donation or plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis was performed using the PCS and MCS+ (Haemonetics, Braintree, USA) as wells as the A 200 devices (Fenwal, Round Lake, USA). 500 ml whole blood was drawn into standard blood bag systems (Fresenius, Bad Homburg and Macopharma, Langen, Germany) and after centrifugation blood was processed into its components. The following quality control parameters were measured: total protein (TP) (AU 640, Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), platelets, red blood cells (Neubauer chamber), white blood cells (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), and factor VIII (ACL, Instrumentation Laboratory). 10 plasma samples were pooled prior to analysing TP and F VIII. Results: The quality control data of 956 plasmapheresis units and 44 recovered plasma units are presented as mean ñ SD in the table. For F VIII and TP data from 96 source plasma pools and 12 recovered plasma pools are provided. Quality data of source and recovered plasma differ for volume, PLT contamination and F VIII content due to different production processes. Conclusion: Our data show that quality criteria of plasma for fractionation were met according to national and international guidelines.

345,EM-201,Aguila et al. (2016),2016,Effects of gamma irradiation on the biomechanical properties of peroneus tendons,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have shown that the effects of radiation on biomechanical properties of allografts are dose-dependent1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The AATB conducted a survey and found that 29 out of 36 tissue banks use a standard gamma radiation ranging from 1.0-3.5 Mrad7. The purpose of this study is to investigate the biomechanical properties of non-irradiated and irradiated peroneus longus (PL) and peroneus brevis (PB) tendons. The ultimate load and ultimate stress of non-irradiated and irradiated PL & PB was evaluated. Methods: Seven pairs of PL & ten pairs of PB tendons were recovered from human cadavers, with age ranging from 13-57 (mean of 41) years old. The left side of each allograft was irradiated at 1.5-2.5Mrad, while the right side was kept aseptic and non-irradiated. Allografts were stored at -80øC and thawed out 2-3 hours before testing at room temperature (23øC). The diameter of each allograft was measured with a graft sizer in a double loop fashion. Allografts were then mounted in freeze grips, with an active testing length of 4 cm, pulled in an MTS model 858 MiniBionix II in displacement control at a strain rate of 100%/sec. Failure mode was observed and recorded. From the force and displacement graph, the peak force (N) and the excursion of peak force (mm) was noted. The stiffness (N/mm) was the slope of the linear portion of the graph. From the ultimate load, the ultimate stress was calculated from dividing by the cross-sectional area. The percentage difference was calculated between each pair. The paired samples were compared using Student's t-test. Results: Peroneus Brevis. The mean ultimate load for the non-irradiated PB was 1466.2ñ203.1 N, while the irradiated PB was 1365.4ñ303.8N. The difference between the mean ultimate load for non-irradiated and irradiated PB paired, was 11.6ñ13.1%. The ultimate stress for the non-irradiated PB was 78.77ñ20.6MPa and 73.2ñ16.2MPa for the irradiated PB. The difference between the mean ultimate stress for the non-irradiated and irradiated PB paired was 12.0ñ19.1%. The elongation at peak load for the non-irradiated side was 13.2ñ3.13mm and 9.8ñ2.6mm for the irradiated side. This difference was -41.9 ñ 42.1% which was the only statistically significant difference for all measures, P<0.05. This elongation amounts to 33.1% for non-irradiated PB, vs. 24.4% for irradiated PB. The structural stiffness for non-irradiated PB was 170.9ñ73.0N/mm and 225.8ñ46.0N/mm for irradiated PB. The paired difference was 23.2ñ34.2%. Peroneus Longus. The mean ultimate load for the non-irradiated PL was 1815.5ñ1075.1N and 1660.4ñ922.0N for the irradiated PL. The difference between the mean ultimate load for the non-irradiated and the irradiated PL was 6.9ñ19.0%. The mean ultimate stress for the non-irradiated PL was 93.7ñ15.6MPa and 89.1ñ18.2MPa for the irradiated PL. The difference between the mean ultimate stress for the non-irradiated and the irradiated PL paired was 2.1%. The elongation at peak load for the non-irradiated PL was 15.7ñ 3.6mm, and 17.3ñ5.1mm for the irradiated PL, for a difference of 3.2ñ37.2%. This elongation amounts to 39.3% for non-irradiated PL, vs. 43.4% for irradiated PL. The structural stiffness for non-irradiated PL was 203.9ñ67.0N/mm and 225.7ñ56.8N/mm for irradiated PL. The paired difference was 5.8ñ37.7%. Discussion: The results do not demonstrate any significant difference between irradiated and non-irradiated PB and PL tendons when exposed to 1.5-2.5Mrad of gamma irradiation. The only exception to this was the observed elongation of PB. However, this difference is probably of no clinical relevance since the elongation is well beyond the normal expected operating range of an ACL (< 10%). SIGNIFICANCE: Sterilizing allografts with a 1.5-2.5Mrad dose of gamma irradiation does not alter the biomechanical properties while still providing a suitable level of sterilization.",Embase,10.1002/jor.23247,

Significantly delayed MAOT were found in the ACLI group compared to the control group for vastus lateralis, vastus medialis obliquus, hamstrings medial, hamstrings lateral, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and gastrocnemius in both vision conditions, for gluteus maximus and gluteus medius with eyes open and for tensor fascia latae with eyes closed. Within the ACLI group, delayed MAOT of tibialis anterior with eyes open and gastrocnemius with eyes closed were found in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg. All other muscles were not significantly different between legs. In conclusion, the ACLI group showed delayed MAOT not only around the knee, but also at the hip and ankle muscles compared to the non-injured control group. No differences between both legs of the ACLI group were found, except for tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. These findings indirectly support including central nervous system re-education training to target the underlying mechanisms of these altered MAOT after ACL injury.",Embase,10.1016/j.humov.2015.09.007,

However, because this technique uses suture loops and cortical suspension buttons for graft fixation, it has mostly been limited to looped graft constructs (e.g., hamstring autograft, peroneus longus allograft). Quadriceps tendon autograft offers several advantages in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction but, until recently, has not been compatible with suture-loop and cortical suspensory fixation.

This study aimed to present a reinforcing method with additional half peroneus longus tendon (half-PLT) graft augmentation. Methods: Eight cases underwent ACL reconstruction with unqualified hamstring tendon grafts (diameter <7 mm) and were salvaged by additional half-PLT graft augmentation. The pivot shift test and KT-1000 tests were performed 3 years after surgery. Functional evaluation of subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores was also done. In addition, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were used to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Results: The diameter of unqualified four-strand hamstring tendon grafts was 6.2 mm on average (range, 6.0?6.5 mm). The average diameter of hamstring grafts with half-PLT augmentation was 9.6 mm (range, 9.5?10.0 mm). The pivot shift test was negative in all patients. No significant differences between normal and abnormal knees were found by KT-1000. The average IKDC score was 86.0 (range, 83 to 89), and the average Lysholm score was 84.4 (range, 80?90). The average FADI score for the donor sites of half-PLT was 135.8 (range, 134?136).

349,EM-205,Bashlakova et al. (2015),2015,The coagulation state in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis and early atherosclerosis,"Background: It is known that some factors of the fibrinolytic pathway, such as fibrinogen, D-dimer, have been associated with an increased risk of coronary events and stroke. Many publications demonstrated an increase of early development of atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatic diseases. The data have been focused on carotid arterial atherosclerotic alterations, such as intima-media thickness and plaque formation. Objectives: The aim of our study was to assess the procoagulation state and its assotiation with inflammation in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and early atherosclerosis. Methods: The study included 37 female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ACR, 1987), mean age 45,0 (33,0; 51,0) years old, disease duration 9,0 (3,0; 14,0) years, disease activity (DAS28=5,37 (4,69; 5,86) points. Twenty-eight healthy women of the same age formed the control group. The levels of platelet cells (PLT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTP), fibrinogen were determined with coagulation analyser, while D-Dimer, LA, IgG/IgM antibodies to cardiolipin (aCL), ?2-glycoprotein-1 (a?2-GP1), high sensitive Creactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-à (TNF-à), were determined with ELISA. The presence of carotid atherosclerotic alterations was revealed ultrasonographically according to standard procedures. Results: The patients with RA had significantly higher levels of fibrinogen, D-Dimer, LA, aCL IgG, a?2-GP1 IgG/IgM, hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-à than in the control group (Table 1). The atherosclerotic alterations were found in 48,65% patients with RA, 28,57% in the control group. We reveled positive correlation between PLT and DAS28 (r=0,626, p=0,005), aCL IgM (r=0,513, p=0,029), D-Dimer and hs-CRP (r=0,747, p=0,003), DAS28 (r=0,819, p=0,0006) in RA patients with carotid atherosclerosis, that reflects association between prothrombotic and inflammatory markers. Conclusions: We demonstrated the presence of prothrombotic state in patients with RA, who had higher levels of inflammatory markers too. Thus, we suggest that inflammation can influence the prothrombotic state in patients with RA, induce endothelial dysfunction and, as a result, early development of atherosclerosis.

Objectives: To identify mortality predictors in patients with PAPS. Methods: Record review of all PAPS patients attending the Haemostasis Unit of the Cardarelli Hospital from 1988 to 2008. We identified 11 deceased patients (5M, 6F, age 55ñ9 yrs), 68 surviving thrombotic PAPS (21M, 47F, 47ñ14 yrs) and 29 persistent carriers of antiphospholipid antibodies (PCaPL) without thrombosis (7M, 22F,tage 50ñ16 yrs). The following had been tested at baseline and confirmed 6 weeks later: aPTT, DRVVT, KCT and plasma fibrinogen (FNG) by coagulation assays; IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) by Elisa; platelet (PLT) count on automatic analyser. Results: IgG aCL (GPL) was 328ñ344 in deceased PAPS, 105ñ146 in surviving PAPS and 75ñ167 in PCaPL (p<0.0001); aPTT ratio was 2.17ñ0.46 in deceased PAPS, 1.92ñ0.65 in surviving PAPS and 1.79ñ1.01 in PCaPL (p<0.02); DRVVT ratio was 2.30ñ0.80 in deceased PAPS, 1.65ñ0.43 in surviving PAPS and 1.33ñ0.32 in PCaPL (p<0.0001); plasma FNG (mg/dl) was 385ñ70 in deceased PAPS, 335ñ49 in surviving PAPS and 312ñ63 in PCaPL (p<0.02); PLTs (109/L) were 293ñ105 in deceased PAPS, 202ñ86 in surviving PAPS and 141ñ77 in PCaPL (p<0.0001).

(2015),2015,The anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the peroneus longus tendon: A biomechanical and clinical evaluation of the donor ankle morbidity,"Background: The purpose of this study was to report on ankle and foot functions via the holistic evaluations using clinical examination, functional scores assessment and isokinetic tests after harvesting autogenous peroneus longus tendons for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction focusing on the donor site morbidity with a minimum 1-year follow-up period. Material and Method: The study included 24 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft and endobutton fixation. Results of ACL reconstruction were assessed via physical examination. Donor site morbidity of the foot and ankle after tendon-harvesting was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot-and-Ankle Society (AOFAS) for ankle-hindfoot score and Visual Analogue Score-Foot Ankle (VAS-FA). Isokinetic testing for the ankle was performed in 10 voluntary patients after surgery. Results: Mean follow-up time was 12.8 months. Regarding the latest follow-up, anterior drawer tests of ankle showed normal findings in 83.3%, and 1+ anterior laxity in 16.7% of all patients. Mean pre- and postoperative AOFAS scores were 100.0 ñ0.0 and 96.0ñ9.6, respectively at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.06). Mean pre- and postoperative VAS-FA scores were 99.7ñ1.1 and 95.4ñ12.0, respectively at ~13-month follow-up (p = 0.09). At 7-month follow-up by isokinetic testing, peak torques of eversion and inversion were significantly lower on the harvested ankle compared with the contralateral ankle at both velocities (60ø/second and 120ø/second, p<0.05). Conclusion: Based on overall findings in the present study, the authors could not recommend the peroneus longus tendon as the first option of donor graft for ACL reconstruction due to the several morbidities particularly in the first 12 months after the operation. However, the peroneus longus tendon may be the option after other graft harvestings for the ligament reconstruction, which needs several tendon grafts in a patient with multi-directional instability of the knee due to some specific situation such as a traumatic knee dislocation.",Embase,,
352,EM-208,Witt et al. (2014),2014,Comparison of quality control parameters of plasma obtained with TACSI CRC kit and quadruple bags with in-line filter,"Background: Producing high quality plasma requires effective separating it from other blood components as well as proper handling during processing to maintain sufficient activity of clotting factors and protein level. Therefore it is important to equip blood donation centres with advanced technologies meant for blood collection and processing. Then due to its specific properties plasma can be used as the main or supplementary treatment of many diseases. Aims: The study was conducted to compare the quality of plasma obtained with two systems used for blood collection in our blood establishment. The outcomes were intended to show if different systems for blood collection have a big impact on the purity of plasma as well as on preservation of protein and labile blood components. The research is planned for the next 5 years to check the quality parameters in time. Methods: The studied material was plasma before freezing produced with 2 different systems. Whole blood collected with TACSI CRC bags after 2 h of storage at room temperature was separated with TACSI WB system. In case of quadruple bags with in-line filter the blood needed additional step-it was centrifuged and then separated with T-ACE II separators. After collecting samples the quality parameters were determined. We evaluated the residual cells in plasma with FACS Calibur flow cy-tometer, total protein and albumin concentration with Konelab 60 and clotting factors and fibrinogen with ACL TOPcls300 analyzer. Results: With respect to residual cells (WBC, RBC, PLT) all studied donations of plasma were found to be compliant with quality requirements; the results differ in case of both systems (RBC count 118% higher in case of TACSI CRC, PLT count 107% greater in quadruple bags) but were still far from the maximum limit. Protein concentration was 3.3% bigger in TACSI CRC, but the level of albumin was the same in both cases. The activity of coagulation factor V and VIII was higher in case of TACSI CRC-respectively 5.6% and 2.9% difference compared with other system, but the results regarding factor IX and fibrinogen showed greater levels in quadruple bags-were 3.8% and 9.8% greater. The results are displayed in Table 1. (table present) Summary: Both TACSI CRC and quadruple bags systems are able to separate plasma from other blood components well to meet the quality criteria regarding residual blood cells. Preservation of coagulation factors is found to be sufficient in both systems and can be summarized as comparable. TACSI CRC as well as quadruple bags can be efficiently used in blood establishments to obtain plasma which is suitable for effective treatment of various disorders.

353,EM-209,Cvetkovic et al. (2014),2014,Haemorrhagic syndrome due to primary hyperfibrinolysis as the first clinical sign of prostate cancer,"Background: Hematologic disorders are commonly seen in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). The most frequently observed disorder in PCa patients is acute or chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The incidence of DIC complication in PCa rages from 13% to 30%, and can be presented as catastrophic bleeding or various thrombotic events. In contrast, bleeding symptoms in the setting of primary hyperfibrinolysis in this malignancy are seen in only 0.40% to 1.65% patients, usually provoked by surgical procedures. It is supposed that metastatic PCa cells produce high levels of urokinase type plasminogen activator. Laboratory diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis is based on the increase of biomarkers like D-Dimer; fibrinogen split products, plasminogen, and euglobulin lysis test (ELT). But, these tests are not specific for primary hyperfibrinolysis and they are also elevated in other pathological condition. Aims:We reported the diagnosis and treatment of a rare case of haemorrhagic syndrome caused by primary hyperfibrinolysis, which was the first clinical symptom of metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: The patient's blood was collected in vacuum tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate and lithium heparin.Thrombelastometry analysis was performed with the Rotem? analyzer. Routine coagulation test was performed with IL ELITE PRO?and ACL 300? analyzer. Results: A 64-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with large haematomas: in the right pectoral and axillary area, size 20x7 cm, right hemiabdomen size, 30x30 cm and left lumbal area, size 25x5 cm. Hematomas developed two days before hospitalization. Patient denied neither subjective symptoms nor any medication. Performed labory analises showed mild normocytic anaemia of chronic disease (Hb 108g/L, MCV 90fL, RBC 3.72x1012/L, Hct 0.331, Plt 419x109/L, WBC 9.5x109/L, Neutrophils 60%; serum iron 12,9?mol/L, ferritin 7820?/L), highly elevated alkaline phosphatase (1390U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (1740U/L) and prostate specificic antigen (above 150ng/mL). Viral test vere negative (HBs Ag, anti HCV and anti HIV). Initial coagulation testing: protrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were within the normal range (14.4s and 31.9s, respectively), as well as anti-thrombin III (86.6%), while fibrinogen level was very low (1.068 g/l) and DDimer assay result was 1122 ng/mL. Results obtained by rotation thrombelastometry have pointed on primary fibrinolysis. First line treatment for patient was combined administration of tranexamic acid (3x500 mg intravenous) and transfusion of ten units of cryoprecipitate (400 ml). Next day, fibrinolytic function measurements by rotation thrombelastometry were within the normal ranges. APTEM test wasn't registered pathological fibrinolysis. Fibrinogen level was normalized within two days (2.4 g/l). There were no newly developed hematomas. Transrectal biopsy of prostate was successfully performed without any haemorrhagic complications, revealing prostate adenocarcinoma-G3, Gleason score 9. Further examination confirmed the laboratory findings of metastatic bone disease. Afterwards, the patient was referred to the oncologist for further treatment with androgen deprivation therapy together with oral tranexamic acid. Summary and Conclusions: This case represent primary hiperfibrinolysis with bleeding diathesis as the first clinical sign of previousy undiagnosed metastatic PCa. Rotation thrombelastometry in this severe complication helps to achieve prompt and proper diagnosis.The management of hyperfibrinolysis was done within a short period of time thanks to adequate diagnostic procedure.",Embase,,

355,EM-211,Eckstein et al. (2014),2014,Subregional but not total plate cartilage change differ between early and late follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament rupture,"Purpose: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is associated with acute joint trauma and chronically altered joint mechanics, and with increased risk of incident radiographic knee OA. Using quantitative MRI, we have shown that the mean femorotibial cartilage thickness increases significantly in young adults after ACL rupture, and that this increase had a similar rate during the first 2 years (BL/Y2) and the subsequent 3 years (Y2/Y5). The purpose of the present study was to compare cartilage thickness change in femorotibial subregions during early (BL/Y2) and later (Y2/Y5) follow-up, using location-independent analysis and novel disease activity (i.e. subregional cartilage thickness change summary) scores. Methods: 121 young active adults with an acute ACL rupture were studied as part of the KANON RCT. Sagittal MRIs were acquired within 5 weeks of the rupture (BL), and at Y2 and at Y5. 117 participants had BL, 112 Y2 and 112 Y5 images; 107 had Y2 and Y5 images (81 men, 26 women; median age 25.6y; age range 18-36). Cartilage thickness in the medial (MFTC) and lateral (LFTC) compartment was measured after segmentation of the medial and lateral tibial (MT/LT) and weightbearing femoral (cMF, cLF) cartilage. Thickness was analyzed in 16 femorotibial subregions (8 medial, 8 lateral, 10 tibial, 6 femoral), and thickness changes in these subregions were summarized using an ordered value (OV) system: the magnitude of change in the subregion with the strongest thinning was assigned to OV1, the one with the second strongest thinning to OV2, and so forth, and the one with the strongest thickening to OV16. A total femorotibial subregional cartilage thickness change score (ThCChS) was computed by summarizing magnitudes of all subregions, independent of their direction (i.e. thickening or thinning). Further, a total femorotibial subregional cartilage thickening (ThCTkS) and thinning (ThCTnS) scorewas computed by summarizing the changes across all subregions with thickening or thinning, respectively. Comparisons between early and later follow-up was performed using paired t-tests. Results: The annualized increase in MFTC cartilage thickness from Y2/Y5 (+24 ?m; 95% confidence interval [CI] 17,31 ?m) was very similar to that between BL/Y2 (+25 [10,40] ?m; Table 1). Two of 16 subregions (the posterior medial and lateral tibia; pMT and pLT) showed significant cartilage thinning during early follow-up that was not seen later (Table 1). OV1 (the subregion with the strongest thinning) exhibited a change of -115 ?m [-130,-100] during early, and a much smaller change during later follow-up (-54 ?m [-62,-47]). Similar significant differences were observed for OV 2-5 and for OV 11-16, with OV16 exhibiting much stronger thickening early (+116 ?m [104,128]) than later (+69 ?m [63,75]). Differences in the TCChS between early (902 ?m [836;967]) and later (483 ?m [452;515]) followup were striking, and so were those in ThCTkS and ThCTnS (Table 1).When dividing the cohort into tertiles of ThCChS change, no obvious difference was noted in terms of sex, age, height, weight, or body mass index (BMI) between upper and lower tertiles (data not shown). Conclusions: Substantial subregional cartilage thickness increase and decrease appear to take place simultaneously within two years after ACL rupture. These changes are not captured when cartilage thickness change is measured at total plate, compartment or joint level. The strongest subregional cartilage thinning during early follow-up colocated with acute posttraumatic bone marrrow lesions and osteochondral fractures, but varied in location between patients. OVs were therefore statistically superior in unraveling differences in cartilage thickness change between early and later follow-up. The novel structural disease activity scores of cartilage thinning (CTnS), thickening (CTkS) and total change (CChS) are highly efficient in describing the different aspects of subregional cartilage change. They may thus be important when relating structural imaging observations of cartilage change to wet biomarker analyses of cartilage turnover. (Table Presented).",Embase,,

Study Design: Ex vivo mechanical testing study. Sample Population: Canine PLT segments (n=21 dogs; 42 PLT). Methods: Morphometric measurements of PLT segments were taken from computed tomography (CT) images and compared with results obtained using calipers. PLT were tested to failure at a rate of 100%length/s. Mechanical properties and failure mode were recorded. Results: PLT width and thickness (P<.001 for both) measured by calipers were significantly lower than those taken from CT images. Thirty-five (83%) specimens failed by avulsion fracture from the patella, 1 failed mid-ligament, and 6 failed by tibial fracture. Dog weight and PLT length had the strongest Pearson's r value when correlated with load at failure (r=0.73, 0.81, respectively). Conclusion: Dog weight and PLT length were the best predictors of load at failure. PLT failure load of dogs weighing >25kg were similar to those reported for the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) suggesting that the PLT may be a suitable allograft for CCL replacement. ? 2013 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.",Embase,10.1111/j.1532-950X.2013.12109.x,
357,EM-213,Arnout et al. (2013),2013,The influence of freezing on the tensile strength of tendon grafts: A biomechanical study,"We investigated the influence of freezing on the tensile strength of fresh frozen tendon grafts. The biomechanical characteristics of tendons that are less commonly used in knee surgery (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus and medial and lateral half of Achilles tendons) were compared to those of a semitendinosus and gracilis graft harvested from the same 10 multi-organ donors. All right side tendons constituted the study group and were frozen at '80øC and thawed at room temperature 5 times. All left side tendons were frozen at '80øC and thawed at room temperature once. There were 59 tendons in the control group and 56 in the study group. The looped grafts were clamped at one side using a custom-made freeze clamp and loaded until failure on an Instron 4505 testing machine. The average ultimate failure load was not significantly different between the control and the study group (p > 0.05). The failure load of the medial tendon Achilles was the lowest in both study and control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness between the control and study group (p > 0.05). From our study, we conclude that freezing tendons at '80øC and thawing several times does not influence the maximum load, maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness. The medial half of the Achilles tendon is clearly the weakest tendon (p < 0.001). These findings show that tendon grafts can be frozen at '80øC and thawed at room temperature several times without altering their biomechanical properties. ? 2013, Acta Orthop‘dica Belgica.",Embase,,
358,EM-214,Karimi et al. (2013),2013,Gait analysis of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed subjects with a combined tendon obtained from hamstring and peroneus longus,"Background: Stability of the knee joint is achieved by a complex process in which the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays an important role. The rupture of this ligament is quite frequent especially in athletic young subjects. Various methods have been used to reconstruct the ACL. One of the new methods is to use a graft combined from peroneus longus and hamstring. As there is no evidence regarding this method, it was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this method. Method: Two groups of normal and those with ACL injury, in whom their ACLs were reconstructed with the new method, participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking on level surface were evaluated by a motion analysis system (Qualysis) and a Kistler force plate. The difference between the parameters of operated and non-operated sides and also between patients and normal subjects was evaluated by use of a two sample t test (p-value was 0.05). Results: The results of this study showed that the pattern and magnitude of the loads transmitted by lower extrimity joints differed between normal and ACL reconstructed subjects. The sound side pattern and magnitude of motion were also influenced by ACL insufficiency. Conclusions: The results of the current study showed that the reconstructed ACL by use of this method did not have enough performance to restore the function of the leg. As the knee joint is unstable following the use of this method, it is recommended to find a new method of ACL reconstruction to improve the function of this ligament after reconstruction. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Embase,10.1016/j.knee.2013.07.007,
359,EM-215,Trulsson et al. (2013),2013,Relationships between muscular activation patterns and postural orientation in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury,"Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury affects the ability to stabilize body segments in relation to each other and to the environment. This results in so called substitution patterns, which can be quantified with an observational test called Test for Substitution Patterns, TSP [1,2], and deviant muscular activation patterns [3]. Here, we introduce a method to characterize relationships between substitution patterns and deviant muscular activation patterns and present preliminary findings from patients and un-injured subjects. Patients/materials and methods: Two ACL-injured patients and four un-injured subjects participated. Subjects performed body-weight altering, mini- squat, knee flexion-extension on one leg, tiptoe standing knee-flexion-extension on one leg and forward lunge [1]. Surface EMG was recorded (Mega Win ME6000) for gluteus med., biceps fem., quadriceps fem. vast. lat., tibialis ant., med. gastrocnemius and peroneus longus in right and left leg. Metronome was used for speed setting. Knee electrogoniometer was used to define start and end of movement. EMG during test movements was divided into 10 time bins for each muscle, with an 11th 'pre-bin' for anticipatory activity. Average amplitudes for each bin were plotted in a diagram. The correlation coefficient, the intercept and the slope of the regression line were calculated to compare activity in corresponding muscles. Results: In the two ACL-injured patients, muscles in the injured lower leg had a high activity also before and after movements were performed, picked up by our method and yielded characteristic and quantifiable correlations with TSP scores. In the four un-injured subjects, the method allowed a quantification of intrasubject consistency and inter-subject variation when performing a given movement. Discussion and conclusions: We present a method for EMGanalysis focused on comparing muscle activation patterns in ACL-injured patients with and without substitution patterns. Preliminary results indicate that the method allows a quantitative characterization between deviating muscle activation patterns and substitution patterns as measured by the TSP.",Embase,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.07.201,

Methods: From January 2006 to December 2009, 35 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries were recruited to undergo surgical procedures. There were 30 males and 5 females with an average age of 31.8 years (range: 21 - 56). All anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions underwent arthrosocopy. All ligaments were reconstructed with peroneus longus tendon and fixed with absorb screw. The post-operative assessments included the followings; clinical evaluations, Lysholm knee score, KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale (AOFAS). Results: All cases were followed up for an average follow-up period of 15 months (range: 12 -24). The healing time was 6-15 weeks, according to the Lysholm knee score, their outcomes were excellent (n =25), good (n =6), fair (n = 3) and poor (n = 1). The average score was 97.2 (range: 60 - 100). The rate of excellent and good was 88.6%; according to the KT-3000 arthrometer evaluations, the outcomes were normal (n =28), nearly normal (n = 4), abnormal (n = 2) and poor (n = 1). Preoperatively, the average anterior displacement was 11.59 ñ 1.25 mm and the average anterior displacement at final follow-up 1.76 ñ 1.83 mm. The average AOFAS score was 96.3 (range: 84 - 100). Lysholm knee score and KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation had statistical differences (P < 0.05) while AOFAS score showed no difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon can be a good substitute of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. And its resection has no major influence for ankle joint.

Materials and Methods: We studied 35 patients with MRI-confirmed full thickness ACL tears, and a 40-patient control group, with no ACL injury on MRI. An 8-echo T2 relaxation sequence (Cartigram, GE Healthcare) was used to generate T2 relaxation values (T2RV) and construct T2 color maps. For each patient, a single blinded observer measured T2RV in the hyaline cartilage superficial layer on two contiguous sagittal images (one more medial, one more lateral) at five predetermined sites, within the ACL pivot shift injury zone, for total of 10 sites per knee. Predetermined sites were the lateral femoral condyle's anterior and posterior weight-bearing area (acLF and pcLF) and the lateral tibial plateau's anterior, central, and posterior zones (aLT, cLT, and pLT). Location of any subarticular bone marrow edema (BME) was also recorded. Data analysis between the two contiguous MRI images within both ACL tears and control group was performed with a matched t test. A pooled t test was used to assess statistical significance between the two groups, with significance considered at p < 0.05 level. Results: Within the ACL tear group, T2RV statistical differences were seen between the lateral and medial images in cLT (p = 0.0005), pLT (0.0340), aLT (0.0388), and pcLF (0.0462). Within the control group, only aLT (0.0146) had T2RV statistical difference. Between the ACL tear group and control group, statistical differences were seen at cLT (0.0001) and pcLF (0.0411) in the more medial MRI image and at cLT (0.0001), pcLF (0.0001), and pLT (0.0400) in the more lateral MRI image. Twenty of the 35 ACL tear patients and none of the control group had BME. Twelve patients with ACL tears had abnormal T2RV but no BME in the pivot shift zone. Conclusion: Articular cartilage injury in a cohort of patients with ACL tears has never before been demonstrated with T2 mapping. We show that articular cartilage in the ACL injury pivot shift zone demonstrates statistically significant abnormal T2RV, even in absence of overlying BME. Knowledge of the presence and extent of chondral injury with T2 mapping may be helpful in treatment planning for patients with ACL tears.",Embase,,

Methods: Twenty-four cases of combined ACL/PCL/ PMC/PLC ruptures including 7 acute cases and 17 chronic cases were reconstructed with autograft in one stage. The semitendinosus tendon and gracilis tendon from both legs in all cases, and the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon from the same leg in 10 cases were used. Simultaneous single-bundle ACL and PCL reconstruction, PMC augmentation and PLC reconstruction was performed. The patients were followed up for a minimum of two years and evaluated according to the IKDC and Lysholm rating scale. Results: All patients, except for 2 (8.3%) having 5ø extension deficit, return to normal extension. All patients showed flexion deficit, with less than 5ø flexion deficit in four patients (16.7%), 6ø to 15ø in 14 patients (58.3%), 16ø to 25ø in three patients (12.5%), and more than 25ø in three patients (12.5%). KT-1000 examination showed that the side-to-side difference of the overall anteriorposterior laxity at 70ø flexion was 0 to 2 mm in 6 patients(25%), 3 to 5 mm in 17 patients(70.8%), 6 to 10 mm in 1 patient(4.2%); the side-to-side difference of overall anterior-posterior laxity at 25ø flexion was 0 to 2 mm in 4 patients(16.7%), 3 to 5 mm in 18 patients(75%), 6 to 10 mm in 2 patients(8.3%). 3 patients showed one degree medial laxity and the others were negative. 2 patients showed one degree lateral laxity and the others were negative. External rotation test showed side to side difference of less than 5ø degree in 23 cases, 6ø to 10ø in 1 case.

Methods: Nowadays, we perform the whole blood impedance PLT aggregometry (IPA) using multiple electrodes (Multiplate?)-hirudin tubes sampling. Before this, we applied the PLT function analyzer (PFA-100?) - citrate tubes sampling. Agonists used in PFA-100?: Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and Epinephrine (EPI), each one with a Collagen (COL) membrane for evaluation of the closure time. Activators selected in Multiplate?: ADP, Thrombin receptor activating peptide 6 (TRAP), Ristocetin (RISTO), Arachidonic acid (ASPI) and COL. Other haemostasis tests were performed in citrated plasma with HemosIL? reagents by coagulometric, chromogenic and immunologic methods, in ACL TOP?. In ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid samples solid phase red cell adherence (Immucor Inc., instrumentreagent system) was applied for screening of PLT antibodies, gel column technology (DiaMed/Bio-Rad Lab, Inc.) was used for blood typing, and ABX Pentra 80 and Coulter? LH 750 for haemograms. Results: Presented in the table-von Willebrand (VW) F: antigen (Ag), VWF activity (Act), FVIII, PLT count; expressed in seconds for PFA-100? and U for Multiplate? ; normal aggregation only with low concentration of RISTO. Both patients are ORh+, had a normal PLT morphology and a negative screening of PLT antibodies. Other laboratory results were normal (including D-Dimers). Case report 1: A Caucasian woman, 68 years old, Gravida (G) 3 Para (P) 1 Abortus (A) 2, with haemorrhagic manifestations after bilateral inguinal hernioplasty in 2009/6/29. Past medical history (PMH): ecchymosis; traumatic lesion of 4th finger of the left hand highly haemorrhagic; umbilical and right inguinal herniorraphies; rectal/vesical prolapses and lumbar hernia surgeries. All invasive procedures, including dental treatments, were complicated by bleeding, except a removal of a skin lesion. Family history (FH): irrelevant. Case report 2: A Caucasian woman, 67-years-old, G6 P4 A2, submitted to a kidney transplant due to polycystic disease complicated by intraperitoneal haemorrhage in March 2004.

Aim of the study. To identify mortality predictors in thrombotic patients with primary APS (PAPS). Methods: Record review of PAPS patients attending the Haemostasis Unit of the Cardarelli Hospital from 1988 to 2008. We identified 11 deceased patients (5M, 6F, age 55 ñ 9 years), 68 surviving thrombotic PAPS (21M, 47F, 47 ñ 14 years) and 29 non thrombotic but persistent carriers of antiphospholipid antibodies (PCaPL) (7M, 22F, age 50 ñ 16 years). All deaths were vascular related and occurred while on adequate thromboprophylaxis. At baseline (and 6 weeks later) we tested aPTT, DRVVT, KCT, fibrinogen (FNG) (coagulation assays); IgG anticardiolipin (aCL), von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Elisa) and platelets (PLT) (automatic analyser). Results: IgG aCL (GPL) was 328 ñ 344 in deceased PAPS 105 ñ 146 in surviving PAPS and 75 ñ 167 in PCaPL (P < 0.0001); aPTT was 2.17 ñ 0.46 in deceased PAPS, 1.92 ñ 65 in surviving PAPS and 1.79 ñ 1.01 in PCaPL (P < 0.02); DRVVT was 2.30 ñ 0.80 in deceased PAPS, 1.65 ñ 0.43 in surviving PAPS and 1.33 ñ 0.32 in PCaPL (P < 0.0001); FNG (mg/dL) was 385 ñ 70 in deceased PAPS, 335 ñ 49 in surviving PAPS and 312 ñ 63 in PCaPL (P < 0.02); PLTs (109/L) were 293 ñ 105 in deceased PAPS, 202 ñ 86 in surviving PAPS and 141 ñ 77 in PCaPL (P < 0.0001). KCT and VWF concentration did not differ. Sex, disease duration, age at first thrombotic event, number of thrombotic events, IgG aCL titre, aPTT, DRVVT, FNG, VWF and platelets were entered as independent variables in a stepwise Cox regression model with mortality as the dependent variable: A prolonged DRVVTr was the single most powerful predictor of mortality that was 20% at 17 years.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is defined as a status of mildly elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels associated with normal total or free T3 and T4 values. In general, it is an asymptomatic entity, usually diagnosed after routine screening or while exploring nonspecific clinical presentations, which has been associated with enhanced cardiovascular risk. There has been considerable controversy regarding the alterations of blood coagulation parameters in patients with SCH as both hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states have been referred. Aims. To evaluate platelet activation and coagulation disorders in patients with SCH and the influence of TSH, peripheral thyroid hormones (FT3, FT4) and thyroid autoantibodies such as thyroid antithyroglobulin (anti-TG) and antithyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) on them. Methods. A total of 24 patients with SCH (males/females: 10/14) and 24 euthyroid control subjects matched for age and gender were enrolled to the study. Platelet indices [platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW)] were measured in whole blood samples by flow cytometry method with the use of XE-5000 Sysmex (ROCHE). Coagulation parameters [prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), protein C and protein S] were measured in plasma samples using a fully automated analyser (ACL Top, ALAPIS). Serum TSH, FT3, FT4, anti-TG and anti- TPO levels were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with Elecsys Modular E170 analyser (ROCHE). (Table presented) Results: The results are presented in Table 1.The levels of MPV and PDW were significantly higher in the SCH group than in the euthyroidic one (p<0,05). No differences were observed in other coagulation parameters between SCH patients and control subjects. The above indices were not found to be correlated neither with the thyroid hormone concentrations nor with the measured autoantibodies levels. Summary/conclusions: Subclinical hypothyroidic patients present alterations in some blood coagulation parameters, which are indicative of platelet activation. The speculation that elevated MPV values may be involved in the increased risk of atherothrombotic complications in subclinical hypothyroidism should be further investigated.",Embase,,
366,EM-222,Arampatzi et al. (2011),2011,"Evaluation of immature platelet fraction, mean platelet volume and endothelial damage in patients with coronary artery disease","Background: The development of vaso-occlusion is believed to be multifactorial. The presence of activated platelets, subclinical inflammation and consequent activation of the vascular endothelium are important contributors that lead to coagulation activation. Large platelets are more active and more thrombogenic than smaller ones. Immature platelet fraction (IPF) is an index of reticulated platelets which are newly released platelets, larger and more reactive than mature ones. Increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) have been connected to morbidity and cardiovascular mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Evidence of vascular endothelial damage, includes levels of plasma von Willebrand (vWf) factor. However, relationships between these factors in cardiovascular disease are unknown. Aims: The purpose of our study was the evaluation of the levels of IPF, MPV, PDW and vWf in patients with coronary artery disease . Methods: Our material consisted of 80 patients, (47 males and 33 females, aged 18-74 years old) suffering of coronary artery disease. A second group consisted of 40 normal controls (20 males and 20 females matched for age and ethnicity). Platelet count (PLT), IPF, MPV and PDW were measured by flow cytometry with the SYSMEX XE2100, when vWf was measured using the automated analyser ACL Top (ALAPIS). Exclusion criteria for entry into the study was the presence of co-existing thrombotic or hematological disease . Results: Mean values of PLT, IPF and MPV of patients presented statistically significant difference (all p<0,05) with that of the normal controls while mean value of PDW was not significantly different. Positive correlation was found between the values of IPF and MPV (r= 0,638, p<0,01). Von Willebrand factor was significantly higher in patients compared to the normal controls (p<0,001) and was also positively correlated with IPF (r= 0,648, p<0,01). Conclusions: Patients with coronary artery disease present abnormalities in their platelets. These patients present more numerous platelets, which are bigger and activated. In this disease activated platelets and activation of the vascular endothelium, may lead to coagulation activation.",Embase,,

(2010),2010,"A biomechanical comparison of fan-folded, single-looped fascia lata with other graft tissues as a suitable substitute for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initial biomechanical properties of a fan-folded, single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft in comparison to other graft tissues currently being used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: Eighteen fascia lata specimens were harvested from 11 donors and fan folded through a proprietary process. Bonepatellar tendonbone (BPTB), tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus tendons were harvested from 4 additional donors. All soft-tissue grafts were tested to failure in an MTS machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) in a single-looped fashion. BPTB grafts were similarly clamped in freeze grips. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness were calculated for each graft type tested. Results: The mean ultimate load to failure was 3,266 N and stiffness was 414 N/mm for the single-looped fascia lata grafts (n = 18). There was no significant difference for ultimate load to failure and stiffness between the fascia lata and tibialis anterior (3,012 N and 342 N/mm, respectively), tibialis posterior (3,666 N and 392 N/mm, respectively), and peroneus longus (3,050 N and 346 N/mm, respectively) tendons. The fascia lata grafts performed significantly better (P < .001) than BPTB (1,404 N and 224 N/mm, respectively). Conclusions: A single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft has, on biomechanical testing, initial ultimate tensile strength (3,266 N) and stiffness values equivalent to or better than several other graft tissues currently used in ACL reconstruction, including BPTB (1,403 N), tibialis anterior (3,012 N), tibialis posterior (3,666 N), and peroneus longus (3,050 N). Clinical Relevance: In the face of potential allograft tissue shortages and increasing constraints on health care expenditures, the use of fascia lata has the potential to be a readily available graft for ACL reconstruction that performs as well as other grafts and at a comparable or lower cost. ? 2010 Arthroscopy Association of North America.",Embase,10.1016/j.arthro.2010.03.019,
368,EM-224,Lehmann et al. (2010),2010,Pathogen inactivation of single donor plasma,"Background: Plasma (FFP) derived from apheresis as well as whole blood is not completely cell free and may contain pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Remaining leukocytes and platelets pose an immunological risk to the recipient. Those residual cells can be removed by filtration and pathogens can be inactivated with the Intercept Blood System by adding amotosalen followed by UVA-illumination. Objectives: The aim of our study was to improve the safety of FFP by filtration with the Plasmaflex PLAS 4 filter and subsequent pathogen inactivation (PI) while maintaining plasma quality according to the national guidelines. Material and methods: Plasmapheresis was performed using the Baxter Autopheresis-C and Haemonetics MCS+ machine resulting in a volume of up to 650 ml. Plasma components were kept at room temperature until further processing. We reduced the residual cells of the apheresis plasma with the Plasmaflex PLAS4 filter (Macopharma) to achieve a practically cell free product. Afterwards the plasma was pathogen inactivated with the INTERCEPT Blood System within 5 h after collection. Amotosalen was depleted with a compound adsorption device (CAD) and the plasma was split into 3 units of about 200 ml to be frozen. By using a specific validation protocol, several in-vitro parameters were tested (WBC and RBC: counting chamber; PLT: cell counter; coagulation factors: ACL Top Instrumentation Laboratory). Results: The plasma products were virtually cell free after filtration. Plasma coagulation recovery in PI-FFP was 76% regarding Factor VIII with an average content of 84%, 96% regarding Factor XI with an average content of 99%, Factor V remained unchanged. The averaged FFP loss was 24 ml. Amotosalen-concentration reduced from initial 145 ?M before illumination to 91 lM after illumination and 0.94 ?M after CAD. (Table Presented). Conclusion: We were able to produce a new plasma product which meets all criteria of the national guidelines with enhanced safety. No quarantine storage is needed for PI-FFP before releasing the products to the clinic. Immunological side effects due to residual cells and cell fragments as well as the transmission of pathogens are highly reduced.",Embase,10.1111/j.1423-0410.2010.01343-2.x,

METHODS: ACL reconstructions with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone were performed in 18 patients (18 knees)in the study from March 2007 to July 2009. Among the patients,14 patients were male and 4 patients were female, ranging in age from 21 to 47 years, with an average of 35.5 years. Twelve patients had the injuries in the right knee and 6 patients in the left knee. The CT scans were taken in a consistent manner at the 1st week and the 3rd, 6th, 12th months after surgery to measure tibial and femoral tunnel expansion. RESULTS: Tunnel enlargement didn't happen in 18 knees. The average enlargement of 18 cases of femoral tunnel was (1.10 +/- 0.42) mm; and the average enlargement of 18 cases of tibial tunnel was (1.00 +/- 0.51) mm. There was statistical significance of femoral tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); and there were no significant difference of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and the 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05). There was statistical significance of tibial tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); there were no significant differences of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone could obviously reduce the incidence of tunnel enlargement. The tunnel diameter obviously increase in 3 months after surgery,and it remains basically unchanged later.",Embase,,

These studies have been performed especially in patellar and hamstring tendons. At our institution, 10 cm length of full thickness peroneus longus tendon has been harvested to reconstruct torn anterior cruciate ligament since 1997 as a different graft source. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the peroneus longus tendon used the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has a regeneration potential or not. Twelve patients, who had originally undergone harvesting of the peroneus longus tendon for the primary surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Images of both legs were acquired simultaneously with the use of the scanner's extremity coil, as we aimed to compare harvested peroneus longus tendon with the other leg's peroneus longus tendon (healthy side) for evaluation of the regeneration potential. The average age of the patients was 31 years. There were eight right and four left legs. The average time interval was 52 months between ligament surgery and MRI. In all patients, a varying amount of the regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon was seen on the MRI images. Although the extent of PLT regeneration in proximal sections seemed better than in mid- and distal sections, there was no statistical difference between sections (P = 0.130). These data show that the peroneus longus tendon has a regeneration potential after harvesting for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. ? 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Embase,10.1007/s00167-008-0626-7,

METHODS: The study included 29 patients (27 males, 2 females; mean age 30 years; range 21 to 39 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft and interference nail fixation. Fourteen patients (48.3%) also had partial meniscectomy during surgery. The results were assessed according to the Lysholm scores and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale at the end of at least five years of follow-up. RESULTS: According to the IKDC scale, 17 patients (58.6%) were rated as normal or nearly normal, and 12 patients (41.4%) were rated as abnormal or severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm score was 83.7 (range 45 to 100), with excellent or good results in 23 patients (79.3%). Radiographic examination showed mild (n=10) or moderate (n=1) degenerative changes in the knee joint. Compared with the normal side, no flexion or extension losses occurred in the affected knees. Stability of the ACL was assessed by the Lachman test, which showed normal findings in 12 patients (41.4%), while nine patients had 1+, five patients had 2+, and three patients had 3+ anteroposterior laxity. Pivot-shift test was negative in 13 patients (44.8%); ten patients had 1+ pivot glide, and six patients had 2+ pivot shift. Two patients (6.9%) complained of mild to moderate pressure pain, paresthesia and dysesthesia at the donor site of PLT. No patient experienced ankle joint dysfunction or difficulty in sports activities due to PLT graft transfer.

Although numerous reviews have detailed their structure, molecular composition, and biomechanical properties, far less attention has been paid to their content of trace elements. Tendons and ligaments are generally rich in calcium, sulfur, and phosphorus, although there are intriguing differences between one tendon/ligament and another. Furthermore, there can be significant regional variations that correlate with the presence or absence of fibrocartilage in the ""wraparound"" regions of tendons or ligaments, where they change direction and press against bone. Here, their sulfate and calcium contents are particularly high. This is undoubtedly associated with the high levels of proteoglycans that are found in these cartilaginous tissues and the occasional presence of sesamoid bones within them. ?

(2005),2005,"Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with enhanced oxidative stress, decreased plasma nitric oxide and paraoxonase activity in an experimental mouse model","Objective. Oxidative stress contributes to atherosclerosis, and evidence of enhanced oxidative stress exists in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In a non-lupus murine model, we evaluated whether anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies could affect the oxidant/antioxidant balance as an early biochemical step of APS. Methods. Hybridomas producing human and murine aCL and anti-?2-glycoprotein I (a?2-GPI) monoclonal antibodies were injected into three groups of five female BALB/c severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Corresponding hybridomas secreting non-antiphospholipid antibodies of the same isotype were employed as controls. Sera and organs were collected after 30 days. Paraoxonase (PON) activity, peroxynitrite, superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrotyrosine were measured in plasma. Expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results. PON activity and NO (sum of nitrate and nitrite) levels were reduced in the human aCL IgG group (P <0.002 and P<0.04, respectively), whilst peroxynitrite and superoxide and expression of total antioxidant capacity of plasma were increased (Plt;0.01). PON and NO were decreased in the murine a?2-GPI IgG and IgM aCL groups (P<0.03 and P<0.05, respectively). Nitrotyrosine was elevated in the human aCL IgG group (P<0.03). Western blotting showed reduced iNOS expression in the hearts of the IgG aCL group, confirmed by immunostaining. PON inversely correlated with IgG aCL titres (P<0.001), superoxide (P <0.008) and peroxynitrite levels (P<0.0009). Peroxynitrite and total IgG aCL were independent predictors of PON (P<0.0009 and P <0.02, respectively). Superoxide was the only independent predictor of NO (P<0.008) and of nitrotyrosine (P<0.002). Conclusion. aCL antibodies are associated with the decreased PON activity and reduced NO that may occur in the preclinical phase of APS. ? The Author 2005.

This retrospective clinical study analyses risk factors and outcome after arthrolysis in a large population. Material and methods: Two hundred twenty-three patients who had undergone arthrolysis after ACL reconstruction were examined. Range of motion (ROM) was reduced due to arthrofibrosis of the joint in 70% (n=156). Other reasons, such as cyclops syndrome or osteoarthritis were found in 30% (n=67). The mean time interval between arthrolysis and follow-up was 4.29 years. We recorded timing of surgery, additional injuries, state of the knee before reconstruction, range of motion, pain during rehabilitation, beginning, duration and type of rehabilitation, severity and etiology of joint stiffness and the time between ACL reconstruction and revision. The present state of the knee was documented using the IKDC form. Results: A significant correla tion of arthrofibrosis and preoperative irritation (plt;0.001), preoperative limited ROM (p=0.001), perioperative pain (p=0.046) and early beginning of muscle training (p=0.064) was found. Combination of a remaining loss of extension and development of degenerative joint disease was also significant (p=0.001). The decrease of sports activity compared with the level before ACL injury was highly significant (plt;0,001).

These are the doubled tibialis anterior (TA), doubled tibialis posterior (TP), and doubled peroneus longus (PL) tendons. Type of Study. A biomechanical evaluation of the properties of the TA, TP, and PL. Methods: Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were used for testing. All specimens had the TA, TP, and PL tendons harvested. All specimens were tested in a custom-designed hydraulic testing machine using dry ice clamps. Each tendon was elongated at a rate of 1 mm/s. Load and displacement were recorded with an analog to digital interface board. Stiffness, modulus of elasticity, and stress and strain at failure were calculated. Results: The average tested lengths of the TA, TP, and PL were 37 cm (range, 13-68 cm), 33 cm (range, 7-74 cm), and 42 cm (range, 17-69 cm), respectively. The average cross-sectional areas of the doubled TA, TP, and PL were 38 mm2, 48 mm2, and 37 mm2, respectively. The average failure loads for the doubled TA, TP, and PL tendons were 3,412 N, 3,391 N, and 2,483 N, respectively. The maximum stresses of the 3 tendons did not differ significantly (85-108 Mpa). The TA had the greatest stiffness (344 N/mm), followed by the TP (302 N/mm) and the PL (244 N/mm). Previous authors have documented the biomechanical strength of grafts for ACL reconstruction between 1,700 and 2,900 Newtons. The ultimate tensile strength and stiffness reported for the TA and TP grafts exceeded that for all previously reported grafts, including the doubled semitendinosus-gracilis. Conclusions: The TA, TP, and PL tendons showed excellent biomechanical properties when compared with historical data evaluating other graft sources.

The specimens were procured at the time of second-look arthroscopy from the superficial region of the midzone of the anterior cruciate ligament grafts after synovial clearage. The grafts used for the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were from fresh-frozen allogenic Achilles, tibialis anterior or posterior, or peroneus longus or brevis tendons and had been implanted 3 to 96 months previously. By 12 months after surgery, the anterior cruciate ligament allografts consisted predominantly of small-diameter collagen fibrils (30 to 80 nm), which resulted in a unimodal pattern in the collagen fibril profile. The number of large-diameter fibrils (90 to 140 nm) within the allogenic tendon grafts had decreased. This predominance of small-diameter collagen fibrils persisted in almost all specimens older than 12 months. The anterior cruciate ligament allografts had collagen fibril profiles that did not resemble normal tendon grafts or normal anterior cruciate ligaments, even several years after surgery.",Embase,,

PLT is thought to play some role in the proprioceptive regulation of the ankle joint. ACL too has a vital role in the postural control of the knee joint. This study evaluates and compares the affected and sound limb balance and function in subjects following ACLR with autologous PLTG. Methods: A total of 44 eligible participants were assessed for balance using the HUMAC balance system and function with the Foot Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) scale at 6week, 3month, and 6month after ACLR with PLTG. Outcome measures were stability score, path length, average velocity, time on target, and FAAM score. Results: There was statistically significant improvement in all the parameters of bilateral or unilateral standing balance at 6month post-op [Bilateral: stability score: p=0.001; path length: p=0.000; average velocity: p=0.000; time on target: p=0.006]; [unilateral-affected/sound: path length: p=0.000, p=0.003; average velocity: p=0.000, p=0.009).

The results of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are usually worse than the primary ACLR. The positive outcome of the revision ACLR is significantly influenced by the following factors: anatomical position of bone tunnels, correct choice of graft, its preparation and fixation method. Equally important is to choose the accurate indications for additional extraarticular interventions. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft in one-stage revision ACL reconstruction and to compare the obtained data with the results of primary ACLR. Methods. The comparison was carried out between the RACL-PLT group (n = 29) and the PACL-HT group (n = 82), which underwent single-stage revision ACLR with a PLT autograft and primary ACLR with a hamstring tendons (HT) autograft, respectively. Subjective and objective evaluation was performed on the KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm Knee scales. Also, in the RACL-PLT group, the position of the central entry points into the primary and revision tunnels was determined. Results. We observed no statistically significant differences during the objective assessment of knee joint stability between the groups (p>0.999). During the subjective assessment on the KOOS, IKDC and Lysholm Knee scales, significantly higher results were obtained in the PACL-HT group (p<0.001). The position of the central entry points into the revision tunnels corresponded to the normative values in all cases. Conclusions. The analysis of the use of a PLT autograft in revision ACLR, as well as the achievement of the anatomical position of the revision tunnels showed: 12 months after surgery, the results of an objective assessment between the revision and primary ACLR are comparable; the results of a subjective assessment are statistically significantly different.

(2023),2023,"Earlier Return to Sports, Reduced Donor-Site Morbidity with Doubled Peroneus Longus Versus Quadrupled Hamstring Tendon Autograft in ACL Reconstruction","Background: Graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has been evolving. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied.Methods: Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared.Results:The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up.Conclusions: PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level II.",Web of Science,10.2106/JBJS.OA.23.00051,JBJS OPEN ACCESS

Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system-Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. ResultsOne year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p > 0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p > 0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p < 0.05). ConclusionACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles.",Web of Science,10.1111/os.14060,ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY
382,WS-6,Goncharov et al. (2023),2023,Outcome of Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus and Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Autografts: A Clinical Comparative Study,"Background: The aim of this study is to compare the mid-term outcomes of primary tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction via the use of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts. Methods: 53 patients (group 1) received ACL reconstruction via BPTB, whereas 55 patients (group 2) received arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft. Results: In group 1, the mean preoperative and postoperative scores on the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire (LKQ) scale resulted in 69.2 +/- 10.7 points and -92.2 +/- 6.4 points, respectively. The average preoperative and postoperative value on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale was 68.2 +/- 10.6% and -90.1 +/- 9.5%, respectively. For KT-1000, according to the results of surgical treatment, it is -3.7 +/- 1.4 mm, and for the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOSAF) it is -95.3 +/- 4.5%. The autograft ruptured within 2 years after operation in 4 of 50 patients. In group 2, the mean score on the LKQ scale before the operation was 70.2 +/- 11.6 points, after -94.3 +/- 0.5 points. The average value on the IKDC scale before surgery was 68.6 +/- 8.7%, after -91.5 +/- 8.2%. KT-1000 -3.4 +/- 1.2 mm. Conclusion: The results in both groups can be assessed as good; peroneus longus muscle tendon autograft is an alternative graft for the primary reconstruction of ACL, preserving the dynamic stabilizers of the knee and has no effect on the formation of flat feet and other disease in the postoperative period.",Web of Science,10.3390/surgeries4030043,SURGERIES

Methods: A quasi-experimental study design was utilized. This study was done at the Orthopedic Department of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, General Hospital, Islamabad, from July 2021 to July 2023. Patients were split into two groups, and they received either PLT or HT autograft. Pain, range of motion (ROM), muscle power, and return to jogging were assessed using the visual analog scale, goniometer scale, and anterior cruciate ligament-return to sports after injury scale at six weeks, three months, and six months post-surgery. Results: A total of 61 patients, out of which 26 patients received an HT (quadrupled gracilis and semitendinosus) graft and 35 received a PLT autograft. The patient's mean age was 26.51 +/- 6.78 years. The HT group had more pain at six weeks and three months, while the PLT group had lesser pain (P P < 0.05). Both groups had mild pain after six months (P P = 0.337). At six and three months, there was a significant difference in ROM (P P = 0.05), but no significant change in the Medical Research Council power of muscles was identified. Thirty-four patients from the PLT group could jog without discomfort before six months. Overall, every patient was satisfied with the treatment that they received. Conclusion: Patients who had ACLR with a PLT autograft had significantly better clinical and functional outcomes compared to those who received an HT autograft.",Web of Science,10.25259/JMSR_62_2024,JOURNAL OF MUSCULOSKELETAL SURGERY AND RESEARCH

Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at the orthopedic department of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission General Hospital, Islamabad, from July 2021 to July 2023. A total of 150 patients aged between 20 and 40 years with an anterior cruciate ligament injury requiring ligament reconstruction were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included previous ankle ligamentous injuries, fractures or surgeries around the ankle, and high-risk sports like football. After the ACLR surgery, the patients were assessed for pain, range of motion (ROM), and muscle power in the 6(th) week, 3(rd) month, and 6(th) month. Return to jogging without discomfort at the ankle during 1(st) min of jogging was assessed at six months. Results: Of the 150 patients, 142 (94.6%) were male and 8 (5.4%) were female. The mean age of participants was 32.53 +/- 4.78 years. Pain and loss of ROM around the ankle were reduced after six months compared to three months and six weeks, that is, P < 0.05.

(2022),2022,Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendon auto grafts versus peroneus longus tendon auto grafts in isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury,"Objective: To compare the outcome and donor-site morbidity between peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendon in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methodology: A total of 80 cases aged 15 - 40 years undergoing single-bundle ACL reconstruction fromJanuary 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled. All were randomly assigned to either hamstring tendon group or PLT group. Functional scoring as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores were noted prior to surgery and at the end of follow-up period of 9-months after surgery. Donor-site morbidity was also assessed. Results: Out of 80 cases, there were 66 (82.5%) were male. Mean age in hamstring group was 27.4 + 9.1 versus 25.8 + 8.6 years in PLT group (p = 0.4214). Thigh circumference between operated and sound leg was significantly high in hamstring group (p < 0.0001). None of the patient in PLT group had any other donor-site morbidity while 6 (16.7%) patients in hamstring group were found to have anterior kneeling pain. Conclusion: Peroneus longus as graft choice in isolated ACL injuries needs further encouragement, as it was found to have less donor-site related morbidities especially among individuals who commonly kneel during their daily activities.",Web of Science,,RAWAL MEDICAL JOURNAL

Materials and Methods: A retrospective matched cohort study with 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching without replacement on sex (exact), age (+/- 3 years), and time to last follow-up (closest match) was performed on consecutive primary single-bundle ACLR cases. After exclusions and follow-up completion, 77 PLT patients were matched 1:1 with 82 HT patients based on age, sex, and follow-up. Outcomes included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form, Lysholm Knee Score, Tegner Activity Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, knee range of motion, manual strength testing, stability tests, limb circumferences, and the Single-Leg Hop test. Additionally, ankle-specific function in the PLT group was assessed using the AOFAS and FADI scores. Results: Graft diameter was larger with PLT (8.5 +/- 0.6 mm) than with HT (8.1 +/- 0.7 mm; p = 0.003). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement from the preoperative to the postoperative period on the IKDC, Lysholm, and Tegner scores (all p < 0.001). Between groups, postoperative IKDC and Lysholm scores were comparable (both p > 0.05), and Tegner scores did not differ significantly (p > 0.05). Knee flexion loss was less frequent (9.1% vs. 68.3%; p = 0.001), and knee flexion strength was higher (4.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.8; p = 0.001) in PLT. Stability tests, LSI, extension strength, and limb circumferences were similar (all p > 0.05). Saphenous nerve symptoms were less frequent with PLT (13.0% vs. 29.3%; p = 0.010). Ankle function in PLT was preserved (AOFAS 96.9 +/- 7.9; FADI 97.4 +/- 8.5) with mild eversion limitation in 3 patients (3.9%). Re-rupture rates were low and did not differ significantly between groups (p > 0.05). Infections occurred only after HT, yielding a between-group difference (p = 0.030). Conclusions: PLT autografts provide clinical and functional outcomes comparable to those of HT, with advantages including a larger graft diameter, better preservation of knee flexion function, fewer symptoms related to the saphenous nerve, and excellent ankle outcomes. PLT is a safe and effective alternative for primary ACLR.",Web of Science,10.3390/jcm14207319,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
387,WS-11,Bi et al. (2021),2021,All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using an Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"Background: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been used as a graft in many orthopaedic surgical procedures because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. Purpose: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30 degrees of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. Results: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 +/- 0.62 vs 7.0 +/- 2.18 mm, respectively; P < .001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 +/- 8.27, 50.9 +/- 8.50, and 1.8 +/- 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 +/- 2.61, 95.2 +/- 2.64, and 6.8 +/- 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P < .001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively. No complications or reoperations occurred. Conclusion: All-inside ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft produced good functional scores and stability without obvious ankle-site morbidity.",Web of Science,10.1177/2325967121991226,ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
388,WS-12,Khan et al. (2021),2021,Prediction of peroneus longus graft diameter for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by inframalleolar harvest and from anthropometric data,"Background: The literature is gradually drifting towards a graft of larger diameter for successful ACL reconstruction. There is no published literature regarding the anthropometric predictors for the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft obtained in ACL reconstruction through the inframalleolar approach. Methods: Fifty-two patients were finally evaluated for anthropometric parameters to predict quadrupled PLT graft diameter in ACL reconstruction using the inframalleolar technique. Intraoperative quadrupled PLT graft diameter was correlated to the patient's anthropometric data such as age, height, weight, duration of injury, and BMI. We used regression analysis in a stepwise manner to ascertain anthropometric indices associated with the graft diameter. Results: This study included 46 males and six females. Mean age was 28.2 +/- 7.4 years, mean height was 172.7 +/- 2.8 cm, mean weight was 75.6 +/- 3.4 kg, mean BMI was 25.3 +/- 0.9 kg/m2, mean duration of injury was 9.2 +/- 3.9 months, and mean graft diameter was 9.3 +/- 0.4 mm. Positive correlation with graft diameter was found only with height (r = 0.6, P < 0.01) and weight (r = 0.4, P 0.01). On analysing through linear regression, height and weight had significant association with graft diameter, and we formulated the following prediction equation: PLT graft diameter (mm) = 0.083 x height (cm) + 0.011 x weight (kg) -5.854. Conclusion: Patients' characteristics, including height and weight, have a significant correlation with quadrupled PLT graft diameter and the average diameter of graft is 9 mm through this approach.",Web of Science,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BURNS AND TRAUMA

(2024),2024,"Functional Outcome of Single-Bundle Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction using Peroneus Longus Graft and Hamstring Graft: An Open-Label, Randomized, Comparative Study","Background This study investigates the functional outcomes of single -bundle arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, comparing the use of two distinct graft sources: peroneus longus (PL) graft and hamstring graft. The choice of graft material in ACL reconstruction is crucial for optimal postoperative results, and this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the comparative efficacy of these two graft types. Method This open-label randomized comparative study involved a carefully selected cohort of patients undergoing single -bundle arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PL graft group or the hamstring graft group. Surgical procedures were conducted using standardized techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols were closely monitored. Functional outcomes, including range of motion, stability, and patient-reported measures, were assessed at predefined intervals to ensure comprehensive data collection. Results The study underscores significant demographic and clinical factors in ACL reconstruction outcomes. Participants were predominantly aged 17-30 years (58.33%) with a mean age of 29.27 years and exhibited a male predominance (80.56%). Common complaints included knee pain and instability, primarily due to falls from bikes (55.56%) or sports-related trauma (44.44%). Notably, PL grafts demonstrated advantages over hamstring grafts, with longer mean length (10.11 mm vs. 8.77 mm, p=0.0001) and shorter operation times. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner Lysholm scores show no significant differences between grafts over the period of time. There is no notable foot eversion weakness or significant donor site morbidity after the PL graft harvest. Hamstring graft cases exhibit a higher incidence of altered sensation and muscle atrophy, suggesting the potential benefits of PL grafts for improved surgical outcomes. Conclusions Graft comparisons favored PL grafts due to longer length, and functional outcome assessments between the two graft types. However, foot and ankle strength assessments revealed fluctuations in strength recovery with PL grafts, highlighting the need for tailored rehabilitation. Thigh circumference variations suggested potential muscle atrophy in the hamstring graft group, along with reported paresthesia in the ipsilateral proximal leg. In conclusion, PL grafts offer potential advantages for ACL surgery, but ongoing monitoring and specialized rehabilitation are crucial.",Web of Science,10.7759/cureus.60239,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
390,WS-14,Butt et al. (2024),2024,5-years outcomes following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction comparing quadruple hamstring and peroneus longus tendon autografts: a randomized control trial,"Aims This study presents clinical outcomes, functional results, and return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using quadruple hamstring tendon autograft or peroneus longus tendon autograft in a randomized controlled trial. Patients and methods Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 +/- 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 +/- 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 +/- 3.9 (range = 85-100). Conclusion Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00402-024-05639-1,ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY

(2025),2025,An Evaluation of the Effect on Ankle Stability of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft Used in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Background: Previous studies have focused on the effect of the peroneus longus tendon graft on the knee; in this study, we focused on its impact on the ankle. Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are frequently observed in sports injuries. The peroneus longus tendon graft has rapidly gained a place in the literature; however, very few studies have been conducted on the foot-ankle region stability of this tendon.Purpose: To investigate the effect on this region of the peroneus longus tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).Study Design: Case series, Level of evidence 4.Methods: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023. The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded.Methods: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023. The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded.Results: The dynamometer measurements of the donor side and the contralateral side were compared. No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the ankle eversion and plantar flexion strength measurements (P = .096, P = .835, respectively). A significant result was obtained in the flamingo test (P = .049). No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the anterior, posterior, and lateral distances of the Y test (78.8 vs 78.6 cm, P = .973; 96.6 vs 80.4 cm, P = .053; 89.5 vs 95.0 cm, P = .357, respectively). In the examination of ankle functionality, no statistically significant difference was determined in the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score of the 2 sides (P = .798, P = .206, respectively).Conclusion: The peroneus longus tendon can be safely used as an alternative autograft in ACLR without causing donor site morbidity.

Patients and methods: A total of 52 patients (38 males, 14 females; mean age: 29.27.7 years; range, 17 to 51 years) who received PLT autograft for ACL reconstruction in our center between July 2018 and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics of the patients and leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters were recorded before the operation. The PLT autograft diameter and length were measured during surgery. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found between the graft diameter and length and weight, height, body mass index (BMI), leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters (p 0.01). There was no statistically significant correlation between the graft diameter and length and age (p 0.05). Distal leg diameter had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft diameter (r=0.956), while the height had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft length (r=0.982). Conclusion: Anthropometric parameters of height, weight, BMI, leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters may be helpful for surgeons to predict the diameter and length of the PLT autograft before surgery. Distal leg diameter is a particularly important parameter in predicting PLT autograft diameter.",Web of Science,10.5606/ehc.2021.79580,JOINT DISEASES AND RELATED SURGERY

(2024),2024,Donor-site morbidity following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft,"IntroductionPeroneus longus has proved to be a promising graft for ACL reconstruction due to its high tensile strength, and ease of harvesting. While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population.Matreials and methodsThis was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients.Results20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 +/- 1.34 and 98.5 +/- 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 +/- 9.43 and 88.75 +/- 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886 +/- 22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 +/- 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio.ConclusionWhile the use of peroneus longus tendon autografts in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction does not seem problematic on short-term subjective assessment, there is objective evidence in keeping with evertor weakness, weakness of first ray plantar flexion and possible ankle instability.Level of EvidenceLevel lll.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00590-024-04046-x,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY
394,WS-18,Sakti et al. (2024),2024,Novel modified implant fixation technique for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring and peroneus longus autografts in limited resource settings: a comparative study on knee stability,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing popularity of contact sports, the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries is rising. ACL reconstruction has been recognized as the most common procedure to restore knee stability. One of the main drawbacks of standard implant is that the medical costs incurred are often beyond the reach of most patients, so patients who need ACL reconstruction surgery must find other financially affordable alternatives. Due to the many knee joint complications involving patellar and hamstring tendon grafts in ACL reconstruction, the new proposed solution is anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This research was an analytical study with a cross-sectional observational design. The sample in this study compared patients diagnosed with ACL rupture who received ACL reconstruction treatment using a modified implant with a hamstring tendon autograft and a peroneus longus tendon autograft. The sample was examined using the consecutive sampling technique by tracing medical record data, used as secondary data, and through the distribution of the Lysholm Knee and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring questionnaires. RESULTS: Out of 69 samples that met the inclusion criteria, 45 were hamstring autograft samples, and 24 were peroneus autograft samples. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of Lysholm Knee Score (P=0.135), International Knee Documentation CONCLUSIONS: The hamstring autograft and peroneus autograft groups did not show a significant difference in clinical functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction with the modified implant technique.

(2024),2024,Clinico-radiological outcome of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Augmentation of Dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Allograft Membrane using Peroneus Longus Autograft,"Introduction: For many sportsmen, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are unfortunate but common injuries. Several growth factors, cytokine, chemokine, and protease inhibitors functions in stimulation of paracrine reactions in fibroblast, endothelial, and stem cells thereby promoting the tissue restorative processes. Augmented with dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft reinforces the reconstructed ligament and aids in effective restoration. Materials and methods: In this case control study 15 patients undertaking ACL reconstruction with tripled peroneus augmented dHACM (G1) were prospectively monitored up for a period of 8 months along with 15 control patients (G2) without dHACM augmentation. Clinical and radiological outcomes were analysed and assessed about effect of augmenting the peroneus longus graft using dHACM. Clinical analysis included pre-operative two, four, six, and eight months post-operative Tegnor-Lysholm score, and radiological analysis included the 6th month postoperative MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements by mean signal-value at femoral insertion, midsubstance and tibial insertion of ACL graft. Results: Clinically, as a mean Lysholm score of all patients, they were revealed to be consecutively high in G1 than in Group 2 at four, six, and eight months. The signal-to-noise ratio from the MRI results showed majority having good healing in G1 group. Conclusions: Based on 6-month MRI, an effective ligamentization (SNR<75) was noticed in 53.33% of patients in the dHACM allograft enhanced group on comparison with 33% in the controls. The overall results show that the augmentation of dHACM allograft to ACL reconstruction yields in good patient outcomes at post-operative follow-up.",Web of Science,10.5704/MOJ.2403.005,MALAYSIAN ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL

We investigated the efficacy and safety of this alternative autograft compared with autologous hamstring tendon (HT). Biomechanical testing of the graft options was performed and compared with the native ACL. Thirty-eight patients with acute ACL ruptures and grade III MCL injuries were treated with ACL reconstruction with a doubled autologous PLT or quadrupled autologous HT. Knee stability and function was evaluated clinically with the Lachman test and KT-2000 arthometer as well as subjectively with functional scores. Effects on the donor ankle were evaluated by biomechanical testing. The ultimate tensile strengths of doubled PLT and quadrupled HT were significantly higher than that of the native ACL and the ultimate tensile strength of doubled PLT was comparable with that of quadrupled HT. There were no significant differences in clinical or functional scores between the two groups. There were no significant differences in pre- and postoperative biomechanical testing of the donor ankle. PLT is a suitable alternative autograft for an ACL reconstruction in patients with a concomitant grade III MCL injury without a significant biomechanical disadvantage to the ankle donor site.,Web of Science,10.1055/s-0038-1669951,JOURNAL OF KNEE SURGERY
397,WS-21,Lubis et al. (2020),2020,Combined hamstrings and peroneus longus tendon for undersized graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A report of two adolescence female patients,"INTRODUCTION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury in young and active population and reconstruction is the mainstay treatment to maintain stability of the knee. Hamstring tendon (HT) is the most popular graft for ACL reconstruction. In certain patient, particularly in women, the size of tendon graft to reconstruct the ACL is unpredictable. In the case of unqualified donor, we need a combined graft from another source to match the size requirement. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of ACL reconstruction using combination of HT and PLT graft in adolescent female. We evaluate knee functional score and ankle donor site morbidity. In the second case we also did second look for the ACL graft integrity arthroscopically. This study has been reported in line with the Surgical Case Report (SCARE) criteria. DISCUSSION: One year after surgery, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score for both cases were improved and no ankle-donor site morbidity with good motoric power and 100% American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Score (AOFAS). CONCLUSION: Additional peroneus longus tendon can be considered as an alternative in undersized hamstring tendon graft without significant donor site morbidity. (C) 2020 The Authors.

398,WS-22,Sahoo et al. (2023),2023,Analysis of Postural Control following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Ipsilateral Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"Introduction: Harvesting peroneus longus for ACL reconstruction is thought to create ankle instability which could add to postural instability from an ACL injury. This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. Materials and methods: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three-and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. Results: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals. Conclusion: The static and dynamic balance, which is impaired after ACL injury, improves with ACL reconstruction with PLT autologous graft. Hence PLTG can be safely used as a graft for ACL reconstruction without affecting postural control and body balance.",Web of Science,10.5704/MOJ.2303.016,MALAYSIAN ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL
399,WS-23,Sahu et al. (2021),2021,Evaluation of Donor Ankle Function after Harvesting Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction-A Prospective Cohort Study,"Introduction: Primary full thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft (PLTG) for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) has been used with good clinical outcome. Recently, it is designated as a promising graft option for ACLR. The effect of harvesting PLTG on donor ankle function is still not completely understood. Peroneus Longus Tendon (PLT) is thought to play a major role in proprioceptive regulation of the ankle joint. All the studies till date did cross-sectional assessments of ankle and foot function at or after 6 months that might have overlooked the timely detection of donor site morbidities. Aim: To evaluate the ankle function and compare the affected and sound limb function in subjects with an ACLR with autologous PLTG starting at an early postoperative visit upto six months. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary rehabilitation centre from March 2019 to March 2021 including the follow-up evaluation. As per the inclusion criteria, 63 participants after ACLR with PLTG were considered for assessment using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle and hind foot scale and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) scale at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-ACLR follow-up. Comparison between sound and affected limbs was done during all follow-ups. The statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. Both FAAM and AOFAS ankle and foot scores were analysed with non parametric tests. Results: Mean age of 63 participants were 29.25 years. Median of AOFAS and FAAM score at 6 week, 3 month, and 6 month post-ACLR follow-ups were (88, 98 and 100) and (97.22, 98.80 and 100), respectively. Statistically significant increase in AOFAS and FAAM scores were observed at 3 month and 6 month as compared to 6 week follow-ups with p=0.001 and p-value=0.001 respectively. The group comparison between the affected and sound side functional scores at different study visits showed statistically significant greater values for the sound ankle than the affected ankle (FAAM: 6 week: p-value=0.001; 3 month: p-value=0.001; 6 month: p-value=0.001 and AOFAS p-value=0.001; p-value=0.001; p-value=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The evaluation of functional outcomes showed gradual and linear improvement at subsequent postoperative visits and restores fully to 100% at 6 month indicating a near-normal to normal donor ankle function following ACLR with PLTG by 6 months. The group comparison showed only marginal but significant difference between affected and sound ankle function.",Web of Science,10.7860/JCDR/2021/49882.15383,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH

(2022),2022,Functional and clinical outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft and correlation with MRI after 3 years,"Introduction: Autograft options for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction over the years have gone from bone -patellar tendon-bone to hamstring to peroneus longus tendon. Considering the drawbacks of other autografts, we analyse peroneus longus autograft holistically as a viable alternative. Materials and methods: This was a prospective study of 113 patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft between January 2017 and November 2018 for isolated, full -thickness ACL tears. Functional analysis was done using the Tegner-Lysholm score pre-operatively, at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postoperatively. At terminal follow-up, stability was checked clinically by Lachman test, residual morbidity of donor site was assessed using foot and ankle disability index, and radio-graphic correlation was done with magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The mean diameter of the graft after tripling was 9 +/- 0.71 mm and the average length before tripling was found to be 27.07 +/- 2.76 cms. At terminal follow-up, 101 patients showed excellent, while 12 patients showed good outcomes. The mean foot and ankle disability index was 94.8 +/- 3. 90.27% of patients had no laxity on clinical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging of all the patients at terminal follow-up showed good graft uptake. Conclusions: Peroneus longus autograft shows intraoperative consistency and gives excellent functional outcome, clinical stability, and no donor site morbidity even three years postoperatively.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.jor.2022.08.027,JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to compare the results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with AHPLT and hamstring graft at the minimum of 3 years follow-up. Knee stability, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and Tegner activity level were collected. Results: There was no clinical significance regarding physical examination. Postoperative IKDC score was higher in the hamstring group compared with AHPLT group. Multiple regression analysis was done. The parsimonious model revealed graft types and gender were the most optimal variables explained postoperative IKDC score. Conclusion: AHPLT graft can be an alternative choice to conventional graft for single anatomic ACL reconstruction with less donor site morbidity, however there must be concern for smaller graft in short and thin female patients.",Web of Science,10.1177/22104917221085722,JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS TRAUMA AND REHABILITATION
402,WS-26,Singh et al. (2022),2022,A Study of the Functional Outcome of Supplementation of Hamstring Graft With Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon in Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Introduction: The present study was done to analyze the functional outcome, donor site morbidities, and associated parameters when using the anterior half of the peroneus longus for augmentation of an inadequate hamstring graft when performing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: Thirty patients with complete ACL tears were operated on. In all these patients, the thickness or length of the hamstring graft taken was found to be inadequate (less than 8 mm and 7.5 cm, respectively). So, additionally, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) graft was harvested to reach an optimum size of the final graft. Functional outcome was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at six weeks, three months, and six months. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score at six months was used to assess ankle stability. Results: The mean age in our study was 28.8 years with male predominance (73.33%). The mean operative time was 86.4 minutes. The mean hamstring graft thickness in our study was 6.5 mm, which improved to 9.12 mm after augmentation. The mean graft length after AHPLT augmentation was 9.38 cm. The mean IKDC score at six months was 87.35. At the end of six months, FADI scores were found within normal limits (range: 135-136) in all the patients. No complications were noted in any of the patients. Conclusion: The AHPLT graft was always found to be sufficient enough for augmenting the hamstring graft to reach an acceptable thickness and length. There was no graft site morbidity and the ankle functional levels remained the same as preoperative levels, making it an excellent choice for augmentation of inadequate hamstring grafts.",Web of Science,10.7759/cureus.30138,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
403,WS-27,Gofer et al. (2024),2024,Mid-term Results of a Single-Stage Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Retrospective Analysis of 36 Cases,"Background. Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is becoming more and more common in the knee surgery due to the annual increase in the number of primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. Choosing the most suitable graft and determining the staging of the surgical treatment by preoperative assessment of the possibility of performing the most anatomical revision canals and their interposition with the primary canals are the main factors that influence treatment results. Aim of the study - comparative assessment of the results of using hamstring tendon and peroneus longus tendon autografts in a one -stage revision reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods. A retrospective analysis of the medical records of 36 patients who underwent revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed. The patients were divided into two groups: in the patients of the study group (n = 19) a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft was used, in the comparison group (n = 17) a hamstring tendon autograft (HT) was applied. Subjective and objective evaluation using the KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm scales was performed, and position of the central entry points of the primary and revision canals was determined. There were no statistically significant differences in the objective assessment of the knee joint stability. Significantly better results of subjective assessment of the knee function according to the Lysholm and KOOS scales were obtained in the PLT group (p = 0.042 and p<0.001, respectively). Position of revision canals corresponded to the standard values, but position of the femoral canal had a slight cranial and anterior displacement. It was also found that the PLT graft diameter was statistically significantly larger than the HT graft diameter (p<0.001). Results. There were no statistically significant differences in the objective assessment of the knee joint stability. Significantly better results of subjective assessment of the knee function according to the Lysholm and KOOS scales were obtained in the PLT group (p = 0.042 and p<0.001, respectively). Position of revision canals corresponded to the standard values, but position of the femoral canal had a slight cranial and anterior displacement. It was also found that the PLT graft diameter was statistically significantly larger than the HT graft diameter (p<0.001). Conclusion. One -stage revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a safe and effective surgical procedure providing satisfactory objective and subjective clinical results. Use of peroneus longus tendon autograft allows to obtain better results in comparison with the hamstring tendon autograft.",Web of Science,10.17816/2311-2905-17415,TRAVMATOLOGIYA I ORTOPEDIYA ROSSII
404,WS-28,Liu et al. (2015),2015,Half-peroneus-longus-tendon graft augmentation for unqualified hamstring tendon graft of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Background In some situations, harvested hamstring tendon grafts are not qualified for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This study aimed to present a reinforcing method with additional half peroneus longus tendon (half-PLT) graft augmentation. Methods Eight cases underwent ACL reconstruction with unqualified hamstring tendon grafts (diameter < 7 mm) and were salvaged by additional half-PLT graft augmentation. The pivot shift test and KT-1000 tests were performed 3 years after surgery. Functional evaluation of subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores was also done. In addition, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were used to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Results The diameter of unqualified four-strand hamstring tendon grafts was 6.2 mm on average (range, 6.0-6.5 mm). The average diameter of hamstring grafts with half-PLT augmentation was 9.6 mm (range, 9.5-10.0 mm). The pivot shift test was negative in all patients. No significant differences between normal and abnormal knees were found by KT-1000. The average IKDC score was 86.0 (range, 83 to 89), and the average Lysholm score was 84.4 (range, 80-90). The average FADI score for the donor sites of half-PLT was 135.8 (range, 134-136).

405,WS-29,Ertogrul et al. (2021),2021,Is Peroneus Longus Allograft Good Alternative for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: a Comparison Study,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To compare the early clinical results of patients who had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with peroneus longus allograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 +/- 6.73, and 29.6 +/- 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision.

406,WS-30,Song et al. (2018),2018,Predicting the graft diameter of the peroneus longus tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between various anthropometric parameters and the graft diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT). We retrospectively analyzed the data of 156 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with the PLT graft at our institution. Anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, gender, age, duration of injury, and preinjury activity levels, were recorded. t tests, correlation coefficients (Pearson r), and a multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter of the graft obtained. The mean PLT graft diameter was 8.3mm, and 21 patients (13.5%) had a diameter less than 8 mm; 85 patients (54.5%) had a diameter between 8 and 9mm, and 50 patients (32.0%) had a diameter greater than or equal to 9 mm. The correlation analysis showed that height (P<.001), weight (P<.001), and duration of injury (P=.012) were significantly related to graft diameter. On the basis of these 3 predictors, the following regression equation was obtained: Diameter=2.28+0.028*height (cm)+0.013*weight (kg)+0.289*duration of injury (0 or 1). Patients who were short and shin were more likely to own smaller graft diameters (<8mm), especially the one ruptured his or her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) over 3 months. Height, weight, and duration of injury were associated with the diameter of PLT. They are important preoperative information for surgeon about the size of PLT and can be used for alternative graft source planning and patient counseling.",Web of Science,10.1097/MD.0000000000012672,MEDICINE

408,WS-32,Rhatomy et al. (2019),2019,Eversion and First Ray Plantarflexion Muscle Strength in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using a Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"Background: The peroneus longus tendon has been used as a graft in orthopaedic reconstruction surgery because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hamstring tendon. However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. Results: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 +/- 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .55), with means of 65.87 +/- 7.63 N and 66.96 +/- 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .68), with means of 150.64 +/- 11.67 N and 152.10 +/- 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 +/- 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 +/- 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. Conclusion: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity. This suggests that the peroneus longus tendon is a promising graft in ACL reconstruction.",Web of Science,10.1177/2325967119872462,ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

Methods The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. Results A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18-20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group. Conclusions PL tendon autograft can be used as a safe and effective autograft choice for ACLR with excellent functional outcomes comparable to HST tendon autograft and minimal donor site morbidity.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00264-025-06468-6,INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS

(2019),2019,Influence of anthropometric features on peroneus longus graft diameter in Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction: A cohort study,"Background: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is the most common ligament injury during sports activities that was treated with ACL reconstruction. Nowadays, peroneus longus is used in ACL reconstruction. However, it is difficult to predict the peroneus longus graft diameter for ACL reconstruction. Thus, preoperative measurements are very important to predict peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction. Methods: A cohort retrospective study was conducted using consecutive sampling method from February 2016 until October 2017 in our center. We recorded patients' characteristics include gender, age, body weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) preoperatively. We measured peroneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively, and analysed data using Spearman correlation. Results: Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. There were 28 males and 11 females in the peroneus group. From the patients' mean characteristics, age was 25.10 +/- 9.16, body weight 71.23 +/- 14.17, height 169.13 +/- 8.81, and BMI 20.96 +/- 3.44. Intraoperative peroneus longus diameter measurement was 8.56 +/- 0.82. Spearman correlation showed significant correlation between intraoperative peroneus longus diameter with patient's height, body weight, and BMI with p < 0.05. Conclusion: Patients' characteristics including gender, height, weight, and BMI in preoperative measurements can predict peoneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.amsu.2019.10.023,ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
411,WS-35,G”k et al. (2024),2024,Peroneus Longus vs Hamstring Tendon Autografts in ACL Reconstruction: A Comparative Study of 106 Patients' Outcomes,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction commonly uses a hamstring tendon autograft, but the peroneus longus tendon can also be used. This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. Material/Methods: ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56 +/- 0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44 +/- 0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46 +/- 3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48 +/- 4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. Conclusions: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain. The peroneus longus tendon, with its larger diameter, fewer graft-related complications, and similar knee scores compared to the hamstring group, is considered a suitable alternative graft source.",Web of Science,10.12659/MSM.945626,MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR

(2022),2022,Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft versus Hamstring Tendon Autograft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Comparative Study with a Mean Follow-up of Two Years,"Background: Peroneus longus tendon can be a suitable alternative autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. Results: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24-31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P < 0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. Conclusion: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be an appropriate autograft for ACLR due to its strength, larger graft diameter, and avoiding potential complications of hamstring autograft obtained from the knee region.

(2008),2008,Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the peroneus longus tendon,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft. Methods: The study included 29 patients (27 males, 2 females; mean age-30 years; range 21 to 39 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft and interference nail fixation. Fourteen patients (48.3%) also had partial meniscectomy during surgery. The results were assessed according to the Lysholm scores and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale at the end of at least five years of follow-up. Results: According to the IKDC scale, 17 patients (58.6%) were rated as normal or nearly normal, and 12 patients (41.4%) were rated as abnormal or severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm score was 83.7 (range 45 to 100), with excellent or good results in 23 patients (79.3%). Radiographic examination showed mild (n=10) or moderate (n=1) degenerative changes in the knee joint. Compared with the normal side, no flexion or extension losses occurred in the affected knees. Stability of the ACL was assessed by the Lachman test, which showed normal findings in 12 patients (41.4%), while nine patients had 1+, five patients had 2+, and three patients had 3+ anteroposterior laxity. Pivot-shift test was negative in 13 patients (44.8%); ten patients had 1+ pivot glide, and six patients had 2+ pivot shift. Two patients (6.9%) complained of mild to moderate pressure pain, paresthesia and dysesthesia at the donor site of PLT. No patient experienced ankle joint dysfunction or difficulty in sports activities due to PLT graft transfer. Conclusion: Our data show that PLT can be an appropriate autograft source for ACL reconstruction, avoiding potential complications of autografts obtained from the knee region.",Web of Science,,ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA ET TRAUMATOLOGICA TURCICA
414,WS-38,Kilic et al. (2024),2024,Relationship between peroneus longus tendon graft thickness and anthropometric variables: a radiographic study using ultrasonography,"Background This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of anthropometric measurements for two-stranded peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft thickness using ultrasonography Materials and methods A prospective study was conducted on 204 healthy volunteers (102 males and 102 females) aged 18-40 years. Anthropometric measurements were recorded, including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), fibular length, calf circumference, and ankle circumference. The Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) was used to assess activity levels. PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured using ultrasonography. Two-stranded PLT graft thickness was calculated using the previously reported formula by Luo et al. A thickness of less than 8 mm of PLT graft was accepted as an insufficient autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of two-stranded PLT graft thickness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to establish the best threshold values. Results Males had a significantly greater PLT CSA (0.17 +/- 0.03 cm(2)) and predicted two-stranded PLT graft thickness (8.1 +/- 0.6 mm) compared with females (0.15 +/- 0.03 cm(2) and 7.5 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Correlation analysis revealed that two-stranded PLT graft thickness positively correlated with height, weight, BMI, fibular length, calf circumference, ankle circumference, and Tegner Activity Scale in both genders, with stronger correlations observed in females. The logistic regression model identified height and calf circumference as significant predictors of sufficient two-stranded PLT graft thickness (>= 8 mm) in males, while calf circumference and the TAS were significant predictors in females. ROC analysis demonstrated that calf circumference and the TAS had acceptable discriminatory abilities in females, with 36.25 cm and >= 4 cutoff points, respectively. However, no anthropometric variables in males exhibited strong discriminatory abilities for predicting two-stranded PLT graft thickness Conclusions Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females. However, no anthropometric variables in males could be used strongly for prediction. These anthropometric measurements can assist in preoperative planning and decision-making, potentially improving ACLR outcomes by ensuring adequate graft thickness in females.Level of evidence: Level II prospective study Conclusions Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females.

415,WS-39,Wang et al. (2020),2020,An Autograft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Results in Better Biomechanical Performance and Tendon-Bone Incorporation Than Does a Hybrid Graft in a Rat Model,"Background: The biomechanical and tendon-bone incorporation properties of allograft-augmented hybrid grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction compared with traditional autografts are unknown. Hypothesis: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction yields better results on biomechanical testing, radiographic analysis, and histological evaluation versus using a hybrid graft. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 66 adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with an autograft (AT group; n = 33) or a hybrid graft (HB group; n = 33). The grafts used in both groups were harvested from the peroneus longus tendon and were fixed by suturing to the surrounding periosteum. Samples were harvested for biomechanical testing, micro-computed tomography (CT), and histological evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Bone tunnels on the femoral and tibial sides were divided into 3 subregions: intra-articular (IA), midtunnel (MT), and extra-articular (EA). A cylinder-like volume of interest in the bone tunnel and a tubular-like volume of interest around the bone tunnel were used to evaluate new bone formation and bone remodeling, respectively, via micro-CT. Results: In the AT group, there were significantly higher failure loads and stiffness at 8 weeks (failure load: 3.04 +/- 0.40 vs 2.09 +/- 0.54 N, respectively; P = .006) (stiffness: 3.43 +/- 0.56 vs 1.75 +/- 0.52 N/mm, respectively; P < .001) and 12 weeks (failure load: 9.10 +/- 1.13 vs 7.14 +/- 0.94 N, respectively; P = .008) (stiffness: 4.45 +/- 0.75 vs 3.36 +/- 0.29 N/mm, respectively; P = .008) than in the HB group. With regard to new bone formation in the bone tunnel, in the AT group, the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher than in the HB group on the tibial side at 8 weeks (IA: 22.21 +/- 4.98 vs 5.16 +/- 3.98, respectively; P < .001) (EA: 19.66 +/- 7.19 vs 10.85 +/- 2.16, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 30.50 +/- 5.04 vs 17.11 +/- 7.31, respectively; P = .010) (MT: 21.15 +/- 2.58 vs 15.55 +/- 4.48, respectively; P = .041) (EA: 20.75 +/- 3.87 vs 10.64 +/- 3.94, respectively; P = .003). With regard to bone remodeling around the tunnel, the BV/TV was also significantly higher on the tibial side at 8 weeks (MT: 33.17 +/- 8.05 vs 15.21 +/- 7.60, respectively; P = .007) (EA: 25.19 +/- 6.38 vs 13.94 +/- 7.10, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 69.46 +/- 4.45 vs 47.80 +/- 6.16, respectively; P < .001) (MT: 33.15 +/- 3.88 vs 13.76 +/- 4.07, respectively; P < .001) in the AT group than in the HB group. Sharpey-like fibers had formed at 8 weeks in the AT group. A large number of fibroblasts withdrew at 12 weeks. In the AT group, the width of the interface was significantly narrower at 4 weeks (85.86 +/- 17.49 vs 182.97 +/- 14.35 mu m, respectively; P < .001), 8 weeks (58.86 +/- 10.99 vs 90.15 +/- 11.53 mu m, respectively; P = .002), and 12 weeks (42.70 +/- 7.96 vs 67.29 +/- 6.55 mu m, respectively; P = .001) than in the HB group.

Methods: Eight matched pairs of peroneus longus tendons were prepared according to a quadrupled, all-inside ACL soft-tissue graft technique with 1 side serving as a control and the contralateral side supplemented. The constructs were biomechanically tested for strain in the inner and outer limbs during a preconditioning protocol, single-cycle load to failure, and elongation of the whole construct. Results: Ultimate load to failure was significantly higher in the supplemented group: 797.5 +/- 49.6 N (95% confidence interval [CI], 763.13-831.87 N) versus 719.6 +/- 69.6 N (95% CI, 671.38-767.82 N; P = .044). Less graft elongation at failure was observed in the supplemented group (3.1 +/- 1.5 mm; 95% CI, 2.07-4.17 mm) versus the control group (21.0 +/- 21.2 mm; 95% CI, 6.31-35.69 mm; P = .052). The number of grafts undergoing a 5-mm or greater change in length at failure was 1 of 8 in the supplemented group versus 5 of 8 in the control group (P = .038). Conclusions: Inner-limb supplemental tibial fixation results in higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation in a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside ACL reconstruction graft construct.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.arthro.2018.10.130,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
417,WS-41,Kraeutler et al. (2018),2018,Clinical Outcomes Following Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Hamstring Autograft versus Planned Hybrid Graft,"Few studies have compared outcomes between autografts versus hybrid grafts (combination of autograft and allograft) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this study was to compare revision rate and patient-reported outcomes following primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft versus a preoperatively planned hybrid autograft-allograft. At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with a double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring autograft (A) or a planned hybrid (H) graft (single-strand semitendinosus with nonirradiated peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up. From this collection of patients, a matched-pair comparison was made between groups, with patients matched by gender, age at the time of surgery, and follow-up time. Revision rate at follow-up was 8.4 and 2.4% in the A and H groups, respectively (p = 0.073). A total of 148 surveys were completed (83 A, 65 H), from which 36 matched pairs were formed. Within the matched pairs, average age at surgery did not differ significantly between groups (A: 35.7 years, H: 36.0 years, p = 0.23). Time to follow-up was 4.3 and 3.7 years in the A and H groups, respectively. Patients with a hybrid graft had significantly higher KOOS Quality of Life subscores (A 69.6, H 79.2, p = 0.028), subjective IKDC scores (A 72.6, H 79.7, p = 0.031), and SANE scores (A 83.2, H 91.4, p = 0.015) at follow-up. Otherwise, no significant differences were found in patient-reported outcome scores between groups. A preoperatively planned hybrid graft, with use of a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated allograft, should be considered as a viable alternative for primary ACLR in older patients.",Web of Science,10.1055/s-0037-1617417,JOURNAL OF KNEE SURGERY

(2010),2010,"A Biomechanical Comparison of Fan-Folded, Single-Looped Fascia Lata With Other Graft Tissues as a Suitable Substitute for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initial biomechanical properties of a fan-folded, single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft in comparison to other graft tissues currently being used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: Eighteen fascia lata specimens were harvested from 11 donors and fan folded through a proprietary process. Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus tendons were harvested from 4 additional donors. All soft-tissue grafts were tested to failure in an MTS machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) in a single-looped fashion. BPTB grafts were similarly clamped in freeze grips. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness were calculated for each graft type tested. Results: The mean ultimate load to failure was 3,266 N and stiffness was 414 N/mm for the single-looped fascia lata grafts (n = 18). There was no significant difference for ultimate load to failure and stiffness between the fascia lata and tibialis anterior (3,012 N and 342 N/mm, respectively), tibialis posterior (3,666 N and 392 N/mm, respectively), and peroneus longus (3,050 N and 346 N/mm, respectively) tendons. The fascia lata grafts performed significantly better (P < .001) than BPTB (1,404 N and 224 N/mm, respectively). Conclusions: A single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft has, on biomechanical testing, initial ultimate tensile strength (3,266 N) and stiffness values equivalent to or better than several other graft tissues currently used in ACL reconstruction, including BPTB (1,403 N), tibialis anterior (3,012 N), tibialis posterior (3,666 N), and peroneus longus (3,050 N). Clinical Relevance: In the face of potential allograft tissue shortages and increasing constraints on health care expenditures, the use of fascia lata has the potential to be a readily available graft for ACL reconstruction that performs as well as other grafts and at a comparable or lower cost.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.arthro.2010.03.019,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY

Regardless the potential, there was no study about the use of PLT autograft in Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcome and donor site morbidity after single bundle PCL reconstruction using PLT autograft. Methods: Patient who met inclusion criteria, enrolled to this study and underwent single bundle PCL reconstruction using PL tendon autograft. Clinical outcomes were assessed with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati scoring systems, Lysholm score, and Serial hop test (single hop test and triple hop test) 2-year after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed with Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle (AOFAS) scoring system. Results: Fifteen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (11 males and 4 females). PLT graft diameters were 7.5-10 mm (mean: 8.30 +/- 0.65 mm). Significant increase of functional score (p < 0.05) were found two years after surgery. Mean score of IKDC was 47.58 +/- 11.75 pre-operative; 78.17 +/- 4.52 post-operative, Modified Cincinnati was 48.86 +/- 12.22 pre-operative; 79.00 +/- 4.82 post-operative, Lysholm score was 49.26 +/- 11.54 pre-operative; 80.20 +/- 5.04 post-operative.

420,WS-44,Vijay et al. (2022),2022,Is Peroneus longus autograft a better alternative to the Hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction? - A randomised control study,"Purpose: The anterior cruciate ligament in the knee is commonly prone to injuries. Reconstruction of this ligament with hamstring tendon has been time-tested but peroneus longus autograft is also gaining popularity. However, very limited literature is available comparing the two grafts. This study aims to compare the functional outcome and donor site morbidity between hamstrings and peroneus longus autograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: A prospective randomised study was conducted on 45 patients, who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were assigned into Hamstring group and the Peroneus longus group. Functional outcome was assessed using Lysholm score and Modified Cincinnati scores for the knee joint and American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Scoring for ankle joint. Donor site morbidity was assessed by measuring flexion and extension strength of the knee and plantar flexion and eversion strength of the ankle by handheld dynamometer preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and I year follow up. Results: Functional outcome of the knee showed significant improvement in peroneus longus group (p-value 0.002) compared to hamstring group. Even though there was minimal reduction in functional outcome of the ankle at 6 months follow-up in peroneus longus group, it improved at one year follow-up. While assessing the donor site morbidity at the knee joint, knee flexion strength showed improvement in the group (p-value 0.02) but reduced in the hamstring group where the hamstring tendon was harvested. Knee extension strength in the hamstring group scored marginally better than the peroneus longus group, which was not statistically significant (p-value 0.5). Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint.",Web of Science,10.1177/22104917221088335,JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS TRAUMA AND REHABILITATION

(2022),2022,Iatrogenic Foot Drop After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft: Report of a Rare Case,"Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using autografts is a common procedure performed in the modern era. The peroneus longus tendon is an upcoming graft with several advantages over traditional autografts. It has minimal donor site morbidity in relation to biomechanical properties of the ankle. Common peroneal nerve injury during harvest is a theoretical concern while harvesting the peroneus longus tendon. The following case highlights the importance of careful surgical technique and timely intervention while dealing with such complications. A 25-year-old male suffered an anterior cruciate ligament rupture while wrestling. He had an unstable knee and difficulty performing daily activities. He underwent an arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. Following surgery, the patient reported a foot drop and decreased sensations over the dorsum of the foot. The patient was advised of a foot drop splint and neuroprotective medications. Neurophysiological studies were not performed since they cannot differentiate between partial and complete nerve injury in the first week after injury. A surgical exploration of the nerve was done. An intraneural hematoma was found with contusions over the peroneus longus tendon. Neurolysis was performed to decompress the nerve. The functioning of the anterior cruciate ligament was satisfactory during follow-up. An advancing Tinel's sign was noted on follow-up.

424,WS-48,Perelli et al. (2025),2025,Augmented Over-The-Top Technique for Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is technically demanding, particularly in cases with femoral tunnel malposition or tibial tunnel enlargement. The over-the-top (OTT) technique offers a single-stage solution by avoiding femoral tunnel drilling. However, its main limitation is the reduced graft diameter, typically between 5.5 and 7 mm, which may be insufficient in revision settings. This Technical Note describes an augmentation of the classic OTT technique using a peroneus longus tendon allograft wrapped around preserved-insertion hamstring tendons, achieving graft diameters exceeding 8 mm. Standard arthroscopic portals are used to prepare a standard tibial tunnel, whereas a lateral femoral approach is performed to prepare the OTT point. Femoral fixation is secured with staples, and a lateral extra-articular tenodesis is performed to enhance rotational stability. This combined intra- and extra-articular reconstruction allows single-stage revision even in the presence of tunnel enlargement, improving biomechanical strength and potentially accelerating biological integration through preservation of the tibial insertion. The described technique offers a reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective option for complex anterior cruciate ligament revisions.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.eats.2025.103856,ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES

At our institution, 10 cm length of full thickness peroneus longus tendon has been harvested to reconstruct torn anterior cruciate ligament since 1997 as a different graft source. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the peroneus longus tendon used the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has a regeneration potential or not. Twelve patients, who had originally undergone harvesting of the peroneus longus tendon for the primary surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Images of both legs were acquired simultaneously with the use of the scanner's extremity coil, as we aimed to compare harvested peroneus longus tendon with the other leg's peroneus longus tendon (healthy side) for evaluation of the regeneration potential. The average age of the patients was 31 years. There were eight right and four left legs. The average time interval was 52 months between ligament surgery and MRI. In all patients, a varying amount of the regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon was seen on the MRI images. Although the extent of PLT regeneration in proximal sections seemed better than in mid- and distal sections, there was no statistical difference between sections (P = 0.130).

This study aims to explore the changes in the ankle and gait after using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a reconstruction graft for the anterior cruciate ligament.Methods A total of 20 patients, 6 males and 14 females, aged 18 to 44 years, with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries, underwent reconstruction using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft between June 2021 and December 2021. The part on which the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was harvested was considered the experimental group, while the contralateral foot was the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups.Results All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P > 0.05).

Neglected injuries have a direct impact on the prognosis due to residual instability, chronic pain, deformities, and failure to repair other structures. Several techniques are used to reconstruct the posterolateral corner, often with autologous ischiotibial grafts or homologous grafts.

The patient underwent surgical procedures for ligament reconstruction and correction of the deformity caused by a failed graft, but his knee remained unstable. During the preoperative planning, it was decided to reconstruct the posterolateral corner with an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft. Studies have shown that the peroneus longus tendon graft does not increase ankle morbidity, and that its length and diameter favor ligament reconstruction. Thus, the present article highlights the importance of the proper diagnosis of ligament injuries in the acute phase, and describes a new technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction that must be included in the surgeon's body of knowledge, increasing the amount of technical options.",Web of Science,10.1055/s-0041-1724085,REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORTOPEDIA
430,WS-54,Crall et al. (2015),2015,Anatomic All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Quadriceps Tendon Autograft,"All-inside anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has recently gained popularity, in part because of its bone-sparing socket preparation and reported lower pain levels after surgery. However, because this technique uses suture loops and cortical suspension buttons for graft fixation, it has mostly been limited to looped graft constructs (e.g., hamstring autograft, peroneus longus allograft). Quadriceps tendon autograft offers several advantages in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction but, until recently, has not been compatible with suture-loop and cortical suspensory fixation. We describe a technique that allows a relatively short (<75 mm) quadriceps tendon autograft (without bone block) to be used with established all-inside anatomic techniques.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.eats.2015.08.004,ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES
431,WS-55,Aguila et al. (2016),2016,Effects of gamma irradiation on the biomechanical properties of peroneus tendons,"Purpose: This study was designed to investigate the biomechanical properties of nonirradiated (NI) and irradiated (IR) peroneus tendons to determine if they would be suitable allografts, in regards to biomechanical properties, for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction after a dose of 1.5-2.5 Mrad. Methods: Seven pairs of peroneus longus (PL) and ten pairs of peroneus brevis (PB) tendons were procured from human cadavers. The diameter of each allograft was measured. The left side of each allograft was IR at 1.5-2.5 Mrad, whereas the right side was kept aseptic and NI. The allografts were thawed, kept wet with saline, and attached in a single-strand fashion to custom freeze grips using liquid nitrogen. A preload of 10 N was then applied and, after it had reached steady state, the allografts were pulled at 4 cm/sec. The parameters recorded were the displacement and force. Results: The elongation at the peak load was 10.3 +/- 2.3 mm for the PB NI side and 13.5 +/- 3.3 mm for the PB IR side. The elongation at the peak load was 17.4 +/- 5.3 mm for the PL NI side and 16.3 +/- 2.0 mm for the PL IR side. For PL, the ultimate load was 2,091.6 +/- 148.7 N for NI and 2,122.8 +/- 380.0 N for IR. The ultimate load for the PB tendons was 1,485.7 +/- 209.3 N for NI and 1,318.4 +/- 296.9 N for the IR group. The ultimate stress calculations for PL were 90.3 +/- 11.3 MPa for NI and 94.8 +/- 21.0 MPa for IR. For the PB, the ultimate stress was 82.4 +/- 19.0 MPa for NI and 72.5 +/- 16.6 MPa for the IR group. The structural stiffness was 216.1 +/- 59.0 N/mm for the NI PL and 195.7 +/- 51.4 N/mm for the IR side. None of these measures were significantly different between the NI and IR groups. The structural stiffness was 232.1 +/- 45.7 N/mm for the NI PB and 161.9 +/- 74.0 N/mm for the IR side, and this was the only statistically significant difference found in this study (P=0.034). Conclusion: Our statistical comparisons found no significant differences in terms of elongation, ultimate load, or ultimate stress between IR and NI PB and PL tendons. Only the PB structural stiffness was affected by irradiation. Thus, sterilizing allografts at 1.5-2.5 Mrad of gamma irradiation does not cause major alterations in the tendons' biomechanical properties while still providing a suitable amount of sterilization for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.",Web of Science,10.2147/OAJSM.S109156,OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
432,WS-56,Agarwal et al. (2023),2023,Comparison of Functional Outcomes of an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Using a Peroneus Longus Graft as an Alternative to the Hamstring Tendon Graft,"Background Ever since the arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has begun, the use of the peroneus longus (PL) graft for primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has never been thought of. There is very little literature on it. Hence, our study aims to compare the functional outcomes, knee stability, donor site morbidity, and assessment of thigh muscle wasting in patients with ACL injury managed by arthroscopic single bundle reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendons (HT), respectively.Methods All adults aged 16-50 years of either gender presenting with symptoms of symptomatic ACL deficiency were admitted for arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR and allocated into two groups (peroneus longus and hamstring tendon). Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm score), clinical knee evaluation (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift test), donor site morbidity (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score (AOFAS)), and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively and at six months and one year postoperatively. The same post-op rehabilitation protocol was followed in both groups.Results One hundred and ninety-four patients (hamstring n = 96, peroneus n = 98) met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences between the preoperative, six-month postoperative, and one-year postoperative scores between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (p=0.356) and Lysholm knee score (p=0.289). The mean for the AOFAS was 99.05 +/- 3.56 and 99.80 +/- 0.70 in the PLT and HT groups, respectively, showing no statistical difference, with a significant improvement in thigh muscle wasting among the PLT group at final follow-up (p < 0.001).Conclusion We observed similar knee stability and functional outcomes and no obvious donor site morbidity among both groups. These patients also had better responses to physiotherapy in recovering from their thigh muscle wasting. So, we can recommend that a PL graft can be a safe, viable, and effective option for usual arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction.",Web of Science,10.7759/cureus.37273,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE

MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using PLT were included. Ankle strengths of the patients evaluated with an analog dynamometer. Ankle range of motion (ROM) was measured with a smart phone inclonometer application. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the postoperative ankle strength(eversion, plantar flexion) in the donor area and the preoperative period (p=0.6 and p=0.7, respectively) and contralateral healthy side (p=0.6, p=0.6, respectively). Ankle ROM angles (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, inversion) were significantly lower in the post-operative period compared to the preoperative period and contralateral healthy side (p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative AOFAS scores (p=0.2).

434,WS-58,Chen et al. (2025),2025,Comparative efficacy of different lengths of anterior cruciate ligament stump during reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon,"Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury affects individuals, and successful ACL helps patients return to an active lifestyle. This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length >= 1/2 and < 1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). Methods A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump >= 1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump < 1/2) groups (n = 17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. Results In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p < 0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p > 0.05). Conclusion During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length >= 1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length < 1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint.",Web of Science,10.1186/s12893-025-02913-w,BMC SURGERY

Peroneus longus tendon graft is not a popular first choice for ACL recon-struction. However, newer literature has shown good outcomes with its use. This study compares functional outcome and donor site morbidity of peroneus longus with hamstring tendon autograft to assess if it can be considered as one of the first choic-es for ACLR.Methods. This prospective cohort study involves 54 patients who underwent arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR. 27 patients each were operated on with hamstring and peroneus longus autografts. At 2 years follow-up, functional outcome was compared between groups using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm scores. Donor site morbidity in the peroneus longus group was assessed using Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores.Results. At 2 years follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean IKDC (77.26 vs 80.78), Modified Cincinnati (84.41 vs 89.07), and Tegner-Ly-sholm scores (85.19 vs 88.78) between the hamstring and peroneus groups respec-tively. Mean FADI and AOFAS scores at 2 years follow up were 96.11 and 91.67 respectively in the peroneus group suggesting no significant donor site morbidity as compared to preoperative scores.Conclusions.

436,WS-60,Pontoh et al. (2025),2025,Anterior Knee Pain Evaluation Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Using Anterior Half of The Peroneus Longus (AHPL) Autograft,"Introduction: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is crucial for knee stability and joint movement coordination. ACL injuries are common, often leading to knee instability and subsequent complications. ACL reconstruction is a standard treatment option, with various autograft sources available. The anterior half of the peroneus longus (AHPL) tendon has emerged as a potential alternative autograft. This study aimes to examine the anterior knee pain in ACL reconstruction using AHPL. Materials and Methods: This study included 51 patients with ACL injuries undergoing ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft. Patient demographics, surgical details, and Kujala scores were collected. Results: The average age of our participants was 25.88 +/- 5.39 years, with mean BMI classified as obese. Significant improvements in Kujala and KOOS pain scores were observed between each data collection. There was a negative correlation between baseline and three and six months post-operatively Kujala and KOOS pain scores with BMI. Discussion: The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft significantly reduced anterior knee pain, as indicated by a better Kujala and KOOS pain score. Previous studies have highlighted concerns regarding anterior knee pain with other autograft sources, such as the patellar and hamstring tendons. The AHPL tendon autograft offers a promising alternative with favorable anterior knee pain and minimal donor site morbidity. Conclusion: In ACL reconstruction, the AHPL tendon autograft demonstrates excellent outcomes regarding anterior knee pain, as measured by the Kujala score.",Web of Science,10.2147/ORR.S495410,ORTHOPEDIC RESEARCH AND REVIEWS
437,WS-61,Punnoose et al. (2024),2024,"Peroneus Longus Tendon Autografts have Better Graft Diameter, Less Morbidity, and Enhanced Muscle Recuperation than Hamstring Tendon in ACL Reconstruction","Background Recently the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) gained popularity in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and has been utilized with satisfactory outcomes. However, there are concerns regarding donor site morbidity. This study aims to compare the functional outcome of ACL reconstruction using hamstring (HT) and PLT autografts and evaluate the donor site morbidity. Methods Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (HT and PLT). Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Knee functional outcome was evaluated with IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores preoperatively, and postoperatively after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements, subjective evaluation of sensory disturbances, and ankle scoring with AOFAS and FADI scores. Results At 1-year follow-up, the PLT group showed comparable IKDC (p = 0.925) and Tegner-Lysholm (p = 0.600) scores with those of the HT group. The mean graft diameter in the PLT group (7.93 +/- 0.52 mm) was larger compared with the HT group (7.43 +/- 0.50 mm) (p < 0.001). The incidence of thigh atrophy (HT-16.7%, PLT-10%) and sensory disturbances (HT-73.3%, PLT-10%) was greater in the HT group. There was no significant ankle donor site morbidity in the PLT group (AOFAS-98.67 +/- 3.45, FADI-99.23 +/- 1.69). Conclusion ACL reconstruction with PLT had comparable functional outcome with that of HT at 1 year. However, PLT demonstrated larger graft diameter, less donor site morbidity, and enhanced muscle recovery without significantly affecting the ankle function. PLT can be safely used as an acceptable alternative graft choice harvested from outside the knee for ACL reconstruction.",Web of Science,10.1007/s43465-024-01185-5,INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS
438,WS-62,Sakti et al. (2022),2022,A comparison of functional knee outcomes post-arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using hamstring and peroneus longus (PL) autograft,"Background: Hamstring autograft (HA) is the most common graft used in ACL reconstruction procedures. However, harvesting HA could weaken the secondary stabilizer of the knee joint. Peroneus longus grafts (PL) is a novel option secondary to hamstring graft with less morbidity at the knee joint. We intended to determine whether peroneus longus autograft (PL) is a comparable alternative to hamstring autograft for ACL Reconstruction. Methods: 84 patients were grouped into hamstring (n = 51) and peroneus longus (n = 33) groups, with a mean age of 26.2 +/- 5.9 in the Hamstring group and a mean age of 26.4 +/- 6.6 in peroneus group. We obtain secondary data from the medical records of several hospitals in Makassar. Results: There was a significant difference in Lysholm score (p<0.05) in the hamstring group with peroneus at 6 months and 12 months postoperatively for IKDC score, anterior translation, Power Grading Flexi-Extension, ROM on flexion, and extension. In addition, in muscle atrophy, the Hamstring group compared to the peroneus group also showed a significant difference (p=0.001). Conclusion: The study's results did not show significant differences between the hamstring and peroneus groups other than atrophy of thigh muscles in the hamstring group. Based on the results of this study, we conclude peroneus longus graft is one of the graft options in ACL reconstruction surgery.",Web of Science,10.15562/bmj.v11i2.3233,BALI MEDICAL JOURNAL

(2025),2025,MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft satisfactorily restores knee stability with no impairment in foot function and with a low failure rate for concurrent ACL reconstruction,"Purpose: Addressing grade 2 and 3 medial-sided instabilities during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is crucial to reduce the risk of ACL graft failure. This study introduced a minimally invasive, medial collateral ligament (MCL) augmentation technique using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft, which was fixed to the femoral deep MCL insertion and tibial superficial MCL insertion. Methods: This prospective, longitudinal, single-centre case series included patients who underwent MCL augmentation concurrent with primary or revision ACL reconstruction due to anteromedial instability. Preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up, clinical examinations, such as rolimeter test of anterior tibial translation and medial instability, knee (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], Lsyholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and foot function scores (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score [AOFAS]) and complications, were analyzed. Results: Thirty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 13.5 +/- 2.6 months and a mean age of 27.8 +/- 9.6 years were included. The side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation significantly improved from preoperative to 1-year follow-up with an ACL reconstruction failure rate of 6.5%. No patient retained a grade 2 or 3 medial instability on valgus stress testing with 30 degrees flexion. Significant improvements from preoperative to 1-year postoperative follow-up were observed in knee function scores: IKDC (48.9 +/- 26.9- 71.3 +/- 11.5, p < 0.001) and Lysholm (59.9 +/- 28.5-80.5 +/- 11.2, p = 0.002) as well as KOOS pain, ADL, sport and QoL, each reaching the respective minimal clinically important difference values. The foot function score AOFAS showed no significant impairment (100 +/- 0-99.3 +/- 2.5, p = 0.250). Complications included cyclops lesions of ACL reconstruction in three patients. Conclusion: At 1-year follow-up, MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft for patients simultaneously undergoing ACL reconstruction satisfactorily restores knee stability, has a low ACL reconstruction failure rate and does not significantly impair foot function.

(2025),2025,Inframalleolar harvest of the peroneus longus tendon graft: Surgical technique,"Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft has recently gained visibility in the literature as a promising option for knee ligament reconstructions. The most used harvesting technique is performed with a single incision posterior to the lateral malleolus, with large series reporting tendon lengths enough to prepare a double or triple anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, resulting in mean diameters greater than 8.0 mm. However, as happens with the hamstrings, some patients may present PLT grafts with a 7-mm diameter, which is associated with higher failure rates and is the minimum acceptable diameter for ACL reconstructions. In turn, the 2-incision technique has longer graft lengths reported, enough to prepare 4-folded grafts, with mean diameters above 9.0 mm, ranging from 8.5 to 10 mm. Once the PLT graft diameter has a direct correlation with anthropometric measurements, as well as larger ACL graft diameters are associated with lower failure rates and revision surgeries, the inframalleolar harvesting seems to be a reasonable option, especially for short-stature patients with a greater risk of insufficient grafts. Additionally, patients who benefit from an extra-articular procedure can have a combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament using the PLT graft with the two-incision technique, with no need for another graft. Therefore, this article aims to describe the step-by-step technique for the inframalleolar PLT harvesting.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.jisako.2025.100384,JOURNAL OF ISAKOS JOINT DISORDERS & ORTHOPAEDIC SPORTS MEDICINE
442,WS-66,Hossain et al. (2023),2023,A prospective study of arthroscopic primary ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft: Experience of 439 cases,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are frequent ligamentous injuries that necessitate reconstruction in many cases. The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P < .001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. The peroneus longus tendon can be considered a safe, effective, and promising graft of choice for arthroscopic primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction because it has a good functional outcome and impressive donor ankle function after surgery.",Web of Science,10.1097/MD.0000000000032943,MEDICINE

However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0 +/- 3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Tunnel positions, which were confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomical positions. At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4 +/- 7.1 vs. 89.3. = 8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71 +/- 0.57 vs. 1.85 +/- 0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15 = 0.36 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1 +/- 1.40 vs. 99.5 +/- 1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up.

Among the available methods to predict PLT measurements, anthropometric parameters are one of the most accessible and feasible methods. The objective of this prospective study was to predict the PLT autograft sizes in single bundle ACL reconstruction by using preoperative anthropometric measurement. Method: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), shank circumference and shank length of 20 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter and length of the PLT autograft obtained. Result: Pearson correlation test has shown that body weight and height correlates to PLT length and diameter also autograft's length and diameter significantly (p < 0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that height, weight, TLL and shank length were signifcantly related to autograft diameter. While height and TLL were significantly related to autograft length. Conclusion: Height, weight, TLL and shank length can use to predict PLT autograft diameter. While height and TLL can use to predict PLT autograft length.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.jor.2020.03.011,JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS

(2024),2024,Comparative Analysis of the Six-Strand Hamstring and Peroneus Longus in Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is crucial for knee stability and is often injured in sports, leading to significant issues like degenerative changes and meniscal tears. ACL tears are prevalent in high-school sports injuries, accounting for 50% of knee injuries in the U.S. Surgical reconstruction, often involving bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or hamstring autografts, is common, with varying success rates and complications. Emerging alternatives like the peroneus longus tendon show promise but require further comparative studies. This prospective and multicentric study included 110 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction from 2020 to 2022. Fifty-five patients received hamstring tendon autografts (Group H) and fifty-five received peroneus longus tendon autografts (Group P). Surgeries were performed by experienced surgeons using standardized techniques. Patients were evaluated using clinical tests and functional scores including the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire and IKDC-2000 at various postoperative intervals up to 24 months. Data were analyzed using SPSS with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Group H showed superior knee function preoperatively and at 24 months postoperatively compared to Group P. Group H had higher Lysholm and IKDC scores consistently throughout the study period. The anterior drawer and Lachman's tests indicated better knee stability for Group H. Complications were comparable between groups, with specific issues related to donor site morbidity and muscle weakness observed in each. The six-strand hamstring tendon autograft (Group H) demonstrated superior functional outcomes and knee stability compared to the peroneus longus tendon autograft (Group P) for ACL reconstruction. Despite some donor site morbidity, the hamstring tendon showed better long-term recovery and fewer complications. Future studies should explore larger, multicentric cohorts and integrate regenerative medicine techniques to further enhance ACL reconstruction outcomes.",Web of Science,10.3390/surgeries5030063,SURGERIES

All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. Results Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22-31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5-8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p = < 0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p = 0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.19), eversion strength(p = 0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p = 0.52), and AOFAS score(p = 0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients. Conclusions Peroneus longus autograft can be considered as a potential autograft option for ACL reconstruction in multi-ligament knee injuries and revision ACL reconstruction. No significant donor site morbidity was noted at follow-up.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00590-021-03145-3,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY
447,WS-71,Held et al. (2025),2025,Surgical Technique of Single-Graft Double-Bundle Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Peroneus Longus Tendon,"The posterior cruciate ligament is the primary posterior stabilizer of the knee. Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) has been demonstrated to improve outcomes and stability of the knee compared with conservative management. Numerous techniques are available to the treating surgeon, such as the double-bundle PCLR technique, which has biomechanical superiority over single-bundle PCLR. Residual knee laxity is decreased, native knee kinematics are better replicated, and improved subjective and objective outcomes have been reported with anatomic double-bundle PCLR. The potential disadvantages of allografts and the use of multiple grafts have created the need for the use of a double-bundle PCLR with a single autograft. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) grafts are frequently used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and good results have been reported with their use in single-bundle PCLR. The advantages of the PLT graft include a long length, large cross-sectional area, and a simple harvesting technique. This article describes the arthroscopic technique of using the PLT for a single-graft double-bundle PCLR.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.eats.2024.103169,ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES

While recent studies report favorable knee outcomes, concerns remain regarding donor site morbidity. The PLT plays a key role in foot biomechanics, and its harvesting may lead to subtle changes, as suggested by imaging and pedobarographic studies. Tendon regeneration may limit long-term morbidity, but further studies are needed.

449,WS-73,Rodriguez et al. (2025),2025,Effect of diameter reduction by compression on peroneus longus allograft integrity: A biomechanical analysis,"Background: There is broad consensus regarding the minimum required graft diameter in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery; a diameter of at least 8 mm is recommended when using hamstring tendon grafts. However, it remains unclear what happens when a larger-diameter graft is compressed to a smaller diameter, and how this alteration may affect the biomechanical properties of the graft. The objectives is determine whether the biomechanical strength of compressed allografts is preserved after reducing their diameter, and whether compression techniques could be considered a viable option for smaller patients such as women and children. Our hypothesis is that a compressed graft may retain similar strength to the original, despite having a reduced diameter. Methods: This was a cadaveric biomechanical case-control study using 30 peroneus longus (PL) tendon allografts. The grafts were divided into three groups: Group 0 (8 mm uncompressed grafts), Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts), and Group 2 (10 mm with a graft tube, compression to 9 mm). Each graft was tested using a Zwick/Roell Z005 tensile testing machine, undergoing cyclic loading between 50 and 250 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles, followed by continuous tensile loading to failure. The maximum failure force (Fmax) was recorded for each graft. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.18.5. Results: Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts) showed a mean maximum failure force of 1902 N (SD: 432.12; 95 % CI). Group 2 (compressed grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1608 N (SD: 233.12; 95 % CI), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.037). Group 0 (native 8 mm grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1341 N (SD: 936.67; 95 % CI). No statistically significant difference was found between Group 0 and Group 2 (p = 0.196). Conclusions: The results indicate that the compressed group had lower resistance compared to the original 9 mm grafts. However, when compared to the smaller-diameter grafts, no significant difference in strength was observed. Nonetheless, the compressed grafts showed a tendency to withstand higher loads than the native 8 mm grafts.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.jor.2025.06.036,JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS
450,WS-74,Karimi et al. (2013),2013,Gait analysis of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed subjects with a combined tendon obtained from hamstring and peroneus longus,"Background: Stability of the knee joint is achieved by a complex process in which the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays an important role. The rupture of this ligament is quite frequent especially in athletic young subjects. Various methods have been used to reconstruct the ACL One of the new methods is to use a graft combined from peroneus loops and hamstring. As there is no evidence regarding this method, it was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this method. Method: Two groups of normal and those with ACL injury, in whom their ACLs were reconstructed with the new method, participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking on level surface were evaluated by a motion analysis system (Qualysis) and a Kistler force plate. The difference between the parameters of operated and non-operated sides and also between patients and normal subjects was evaluated by use of a two sample t test (p-value was 0.05). Results: The results of this study showed that the pattern and magnitude of the loads transmitted by lower extrimity joints differed between normal and ACL reconstructed subjects. The sound side pattern and magnitude of motion were also influenced by ACL insufficiency. Conclusions: The results of the current study showed that the reconstructed ACL by use of this method did not have enough performance to restore the function of the leg. As the knee joint is unstable following the use of this method, it is recommended to find a new method of ACL reconstruction to improve the function of this ligament after reconstruction.

451,WS-75,Farey et al. (2024),2024,Outcomes of ACL Reconstruction Utilizing Supercritical CO2-Sterilized Allografts,"Background: Allograft tendons are perceived to have a high ACL graft failure rate in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO2-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. Hypothesis: ACLR with SCCO2 allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO2-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL-Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. Results: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 +/- 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged <= 25 years (P = .007). Neither donor age (<= 40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P > .05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. Conclusion: SCCO2 processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft.",Web of Science,10.1177/23259671241254115,ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
452,WS-76,Lara et al. (2024),2024,New Graft Choices for ACL Reconstruction: Update Article,"Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common procedure for injuries to this ligament, especially in athletes. There are different types of grafts used, and the choice depends on several factors. Autologous grafts, from the patients themselves, are the most common option, with rapid incorporation and a lower failure rate. Allografts from donors have their role in specific cases. Synthetic grafts, used in the 1980s, have advantages such as the absence of morbidity at the donor site, but studies have shown long-term complications. Hybrid grafts, combining autologous grafts and allografts, have gained interest, allowing a larger diameter and reducing morbidity. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has received attention, with positive results, good knee function and less hypotrophy of the thigh at the donor site. Autologous quadriceps tendon graft has gained popularity, with results comparable to patellar and flexor tendon grafts, lower morbidity at the donor site and a lower rate of re-rupture. The choice of graft has evolved, with autologous flexor grafts being preferred for less active patients and patellar grafts with bone fragments for high-performance athletes. Allografts, synthetic and hybrid grafts have their role in specific circumstances. The choice must be based on scientific evidence, considering advantages and disadvantages. ACL reconstruction is a complex procedure that requires individual considerations to select the most appropriate graft.",Web of Science,10.1055/s-0044-1779335,REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORTOPEDIA
453,WS-77,Rudy; Mustamsir et al. (2017),2017,Tensile strength comparison between peroneus longus and hamstring tendons: A biomechanical study,"Introduction: Soft tissue injuries, particularly ligaments and tendons, are the most common injuries in sports, account for more than 50% of all injuries and often require orthopedic surgery. According to data in the general population, the incidence rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury was 1: 3500. The treatment option of ACL injury cases include physical exercise and reconstruction surgery. Graft options for the ACL reconstruction include: autograft and allograft. One of the most popular autograft is hamstring. The use of hamstrings in ACL reconstruction still arguing among the expert. The choice of autograft that can be chosen as a new alternative is the peroneus longus tendon. Currently, there is very few biomechanical study on peroneus longus strength as an alternative choice of autograft in ACL reconstruction. The study to determine the tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon was conducted by the researcher as a preliminary study that could bring new perspective for future studies. Materials and methods: This is an experimental research. Six human cadaveric specimens as research material. Each cadaver was treated by taking hamstring and peroneus from both lower limbs. The hamstring and peroneal tendons were then measured by applying the Hydraulic Servo Pulser tensile test apparatus. Data on tensile strength comparison between peroneal tendon and hamstring were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. Result: From the measurement results, it is known that hamstring has lower average tensile strength value compared to peroneus without significant difference (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon, which is similar to that of hamstring, gives information that both have the same biomechanic properties. Peroneus longus should not be used as a first option in ACL reconstruction, but may be used as an alternative donor in cases involving multiple instability that require more tendon donors in the reconstruction.

454,WS-78,Goyal et al. (2021),2021,Outcomes of one-stage reconstruction for chronic multiligament injuries of knee,"Purpose This article aims to evaluate patterns of chronic multiligament injuries and outcomes of treatment with single-stage reconstruction using autografts. Methods All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6 weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years' follow-up. Results A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48 +/- 9.9 years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2%) or chondral (40.7%) injuries. At the 2 years' follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p = 0.0001) IKDC score (p = 0.0001), Lysholm score (p = 0.0001), and range of motion (p = 0.001). None of the patients had residual laxity on clinical examination of the knee joint at the 2 years' follow-up. All but two of the patients went back to their previous activity level. These two patients had progressive knee arthritis and needed knee arthroplasty. Conclusion Single-stage surgical reconstruction for chronic MKI has favourable functional outcomes.",Web of Science,10.1186/s43019-020-00083-y,KNEE SURGERY & RELATED RESEARCH

(2015),2015,Lower extremity muscle activation onset times during the transition from double-leg stance to single-leg stance in anterior cruciate ligament injured subjects,"The goal of this study was to evaluate muscle activation onset times (MAOT) of both legs during a transition task from double-leg stance (DLS) to single-leg stance (SLS) in anterior cruciate ligament injured (ACLI) (n = 15) and non-injured control subjects (n = 15) with eyes open and eyes closed. Significantly delayed MAOT were found in the ACLI group compared to the control group for vastus lateralis, vastus medialis obliquus, hamstrings medial, hamstrings lateral, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and gastrocnemius in both vision conditions, for gluteus maximus and gluteus medius with eyes open and for tensor fascia latae with eyes closed. Within the ACLI group, delayed MAOT of tibialis anterior with eyes open and gastrocnemius with eyes closed were found in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg. All other muscles were not significantly different between legs. In conclusion, the ACLI group showed delayed MAOT not only around the knee, but also at the hip and ankle muscles compared to the non-injured control group. No differences between both legs of the ACLI group were found, except for tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. These findings indirectly support including central nervous system re-education training to target the underlying mechanisms of these altered MAOT after ACL injury. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

458,WS-82,Wong et al. (2019),2019,Biomechanical and geometric characterization of peroneus longus allografts with respect to age,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are among the most common injuries in high impact sports, and reconstruction is the standard surgical procedure for these ruptures. Reconstructions are often performed using allografts rather than autografts on a case-by-case basis. Controversy exists as to whether or not age of donor tissue plays a factor in the mechanical properties of allografts. Methods: 38 peroneus longus (PL) tendons were prepared using the two-strand graft technique and then subjected to a cyclic loading test regimen of 1000 cycles to determine material properties. Specimens were grouped based on age to ascertain whether donor age affects the material properties of PL tendons. Findings: Secant modulus of the first cycle was determined to be 150.43 (SD 40.24) MPa. The average magnitude of the dynamic modulus was determined to be 82.81 (SD 24.65) MPa. Specimens were grouped into three distinct groups for analysis (x < 40 yo, 40 yo x <= 60 yo, 60 yo < x). Interpretation: The need for using intrinsic material properties is highlighted. There is no significant difference in any intrinsic material property with respect to age or the fatigue of the tendon as the cycle count increases. Conversely, the measured stiffness of a tendon decreased as function of age with a large effect size. Based on analysis of graft geometries, it was determined that PL tendons become significantly more slender with increased age which result in the observed decrease in stiffness.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2019.04.017,CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS

The specimens were procured at the time of second-look arthroscopy from the superficial region of the midzone of the anterior cruciate ligament grafts after synovial clearage. The grafts used for the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were from fresh-frozen allogenic Achilles, tibialis anterior or posterior, or peroneus longus or brevis tendons and had been implanted 3 to 96 months previously. By 12 months after surgery, the anterior cruciate ligament allografts consisted predominantly of small-diameter collagen fibrils (30 to 80 nm), which resulted in a unimodal pattern in the collagen fibril profile. The number of large-diameter fibrils (90 to 140 nm) within the allogenic tendon grafts had decreased. This predominance of small-diameter collagen fibrils persisted in almost all specimens older than 12 months. The anterior cruciate ligament allografts had collagen fibril profiles that did not resemble normal tendon grafts or normal anterior cruciate ligaments, even several years after surgery.",Web of Science,10.1177/036354659502300213,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

(2024),2024,The effect of sterilization and storage on the viscoelastic properties of human tendon allografts - Continued: Storage for 0 to 4 months,"The role of donor-derived tendons, also known as allografts, in anterior cruciate ligament replacement surgeries is steadily increasing. Before surgery, temporary storage and, in most cases, sterilization are essential. It is, thus, crucial to determine how these procedures alter the grafts' biomechanical properties. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of different sterilization methods (native, frozen, frozen + 21 kGy gamma irradiation, frozen + 21 kGy electron beam irradiation) and storage durations (0 to 4 months) on the deformation and creep of two tendon types (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus). 80 tibialis anterior and 83 peroneus longus tendons from 51 human cadavers were included. The samples were removed, placed in a radio-cryoprotectant solution, then slowly cooled, sterilized and stored at -80 degrees C. All groups were subject to 60 s static creep test with 250 N load. Deformation during the loading phase, creep during static loading, and the ratio of these two were evaluated. Deformation at the end of the loading phase and creep consistently exhibited significantly smaller values in the tibialis anterior compared to the peroneus longus type, as well as in electron beam-sterilized grafts as opposed to gamma beam-sterilized ones. Prolonged storage periods (within 0 to 4 months) resulted in a notable increase in these values, particularly in deformation. Based on the experimental data, the tibialis anterior tendon type and sterilization by gamma beam irradiation are better choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than the peroneus longus and sterilization by electron beam. Increased storage time affects negatively the evaluated mechanical properties.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2023.111904,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS
461,WS-85,G”kler et al. (2021),2021,The effect of sterilization and storage on the viscoelastic properties of human tendon allografts,"Allografts have become increasingly preferred for anterior cruciate ligament replacement purposes. The risk of infections necessitates thorough sterilization procedures, and the allografts usually need to be stored prior to surgery. Classical mechanical tests have been performed with various types of tendons, however, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus tend to suffer the least biomechanical changes after irradiation. Only few results are available of the strain and creep behaviour of tendons, even though this information is necessary to provide suitable allografts. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of different tendon types (T-tibialis anterior, P-peroneus longus), sterilization methods (G-gamma irradiation of 21 kGy, E-electron beam irradiation of 21 kGy) and storage times (5 and 6 months) on the creep behavior, which is characterized by the strain at the end of the loading phase and creep deformation after static loading. Static creep tests were performed with 250 N load during 60 s. Deformation at the end of the loading phase of both tendons was significantly smaller after 5 months long storage than that after 6 months long storage. TE5 showed significantly less creep than group TE6, and TE6 significantly greater than PE6. The creep of TE5 was significantly lower than that of TG5. Based on the data, the peroneus longus sterilized by electron beam and stored deep frozen for 5 months is a better choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than tibialis anterior sterilized by gamma irradiation stored for 6 months.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110697,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS
462,WS-86,Inclan et al.

Revision ACLr is often indicated to restore knee stability, improve knee function, and facilitate return to cutting and pivoting activities. Prior to reconstruction, a thorough clinical and diagnostic evaluation is required to identify factors that may have predisposed an individual to recurrent ACL injury, appreciate concurrent intra-articular pathology, and select the optimal graft for revision reconstruction. Single-stage revision can be successful, although a staged approach may be used when optimal tunnel placement is not possible due to the position and/or widening of previous tunnels. Revision ACLr often involves concomitant procedures such as meniscal/chondral treatment, lateral extra-articular augmentation, and/or osteotomy. Although revision ACLr reliably restores knee stability and function, clinical outcomes and reoperation rates are worse than for primary ACLr.",Web of Science,10.1302/0301-620X.105B5.BJJ-2022-1064,BONE & JOINT JOURNAL
463,WS-87,Cassano et al. (2025),2025,Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Combined with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Clinical and Functional Outcomes,"Background and Objectives: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is crucial for knee stability, preventing anterior displacement of the tibia and rotation relative to the femur. Despite ACL reconstruction (ACLR), residual instability is common, affecting knee function. Anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) alongside ACLR improves outcomes, as the ALL plays a significant role in rotational stability. This study aims to assess the clinical and functional outcomes of the ACLR+ALLR combination using biomechanical testing in patients with at least ten months of follow-up. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional comparative cohort study involves patients with ACLR. Inclusion criteria were adult patients who underwent ACLR within the last 3 years, with the same surgical technique performed by a single operator. Patients underwent anamnestic and clinical evaluation and completed Lysholm and KOOS questionnaires. Biomechanical tests included a Unilateral Drop Jump, a Countermovement Jump with knee rotation, and a five-repetition Sit-To-Stand. Force platforms, a camera, and surface electromyography were used to assess biomechanical stability and joint function. Results: This study included 18 subjects, 5 with ACLR and ALLR, and 13 with ACLR alone. The groups showed no significant differences in the KOOS and Lysholm scales and clinical outcomes. Muscle trophism reduction compared to the contralateral limb was noted in both groups. Biomechanical evaluations showed no difference in Quadriceps muscle activity during the landing phase of the Drop Jump. However, the ACL-ALL group exhibited fewer spikes and fewer knee joint angular excursions during ground impact stabilization. In the 5-STS task, a significant difference was observed in the vertical force peak. Differences in muscle activity during foot rotation and force components during the jumping phase were noted in the Countermovement Jump. Conclusions: ACLR combined with ALLR shows similar perceived joint function but improved biomechanical joint stability. Further studies with larger samples and longer follow-ups are needed for validation.",Web of Science,10.3390/medicina61061011,MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
464,WS-88,King et al. (2021),2021,Can Biomechanical Testing After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Identify Athletes at Risk for Subsequent ACL Injury to the Contralateral Uninjured Limb?,"Background: Athletes are twice as likely to rupture the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on their healthy contralateral knee than the reconstructed graft after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Although physical testing is commonly used after ACLR to assess injury risk to the operated knee, strength, jump, and change-of-direction performance and biomechanical measures have not been examined in those who go on to experience a contralateral ACL injury, to identify factors that may be associated with injury risk. Purpose: To prospectively examine differences in biomechanical and clinical performance measures in male athletes 9 months after ACLR between those who ruptured their previously uninjured contralateral ACL and those who did not at 2-year follow-up and to examine the ability of these differences to predict contralateral ACL injury. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A cohort of male athletes returning to level 1 sports after ACLR (N = 1045) underwent isokinetic strength testing and 3-dimensional biomechanical analysis of jump and change-of-direction tests 9 months after surgery. Participants were followed up at 2 years regarding return to play or at second ACL injury. Between-group differences were analyzed in patient-reported outcomes, performance measures, and 3-dimensional biomechanics for the contralateral limb and asymmetry. Logistic regression was applied to determine the ability of identified differences to predict contralateral ACL injury. Results: Of the cohort, 993 had follow-up at 2 years (95%), with 67 experiencing a contralateral ACL injury and 38 an ipsilateral injury. Male athletes who had a contralateral ACL injury had lower quadriceps strength and biomechanical differences on the contralateral limb during double- and single-leg drop jump tests as compared with those who did not experience an injury. Differences were related primarily to deficits in sagittal plane mechanics and plyometric ability on the contralateral side. These variables could explain group membership with fair to good ability (area under the curve, 0.74-0.80). Patient-reported outcomes, limb symmetry of clinical performance measures, and biomechanical measures in change-of-direction tasks did not differentiate those at risk for contralateral injury. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of sagittal plane control during drop jump tasks and the limited utility of limb symmetry in performance and biomechanical measures when assessing future contralateral ACL injury risk in male athletes. Targeting the identified differences in quadriceps strength and plyometric ability during late-stage rehabilitation and testing may reduce ACL injury risk in healthy limbs in male athletes playing level 1 sports.

Primary repair has narrow indications, typically a Sherman type 1 tear pattern representing a femoral avulsion with good tissue quality. In addition, recent research has shown greater postoperative laxity in repairs deemed successful in comparison to laxity in patients undergoing reconstruction. Our primary point is worth repeating: In contrast to ACL primary repair, ACL reconstruction is the gold standard for ACL tears.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.arthro.2024.09.012,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY

An emerging body of literature suggests that LET augmentation may be beneficial for patients undergoing primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, particularly those with a higher risk of reinjury based on preoperative factors. Although limited data are available to guide the use of LET beyond isolated ACL injury, anterolateral procedures may have a role in conjunction with ACL reconstruction in the setting of a multi-ligament knee surgery.

467,WS-91,Randall et al. (2025),2025,Isolated Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis After Prior Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET), as an adjunct to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, is gaining popularity among pediatric and sports medicine orthopaedic surgeons for the treatment of ACL injury, especially in the female, hyperflexible, and high-risk athlete population. The addition of LET or anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction is typically recommended at the time of index ACL reconstruction surgery and is performed after the ACL graft is tensioned. Rotational instability has been described in cases where the ACL graft was malpositioned too vertically, and in those cases, ACL revision is indicated. In our case, ACL reconstruction was performed in isolation in a hyperflexible, high-risk (volleyball) female athlete, and she had persistent complaints of rotational instability despite an intact and well-positioned ACL graft on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. She demonstrated excessive internal rotation of the tibia in relation to the femur and exhibited symptomatic anterolateral instability on clinical examination, with a negative pivot shift but pain on internal rotation stress. She underwent a second surgery consisting of isolated modified Lemaire LET after examination under anesthesia (EUA) demonstrated negative Lachman and pivot shift. Second-look arthroscopy demonstrated an intact quadriceps autograft ACL graft. She recovered uneventfully, and her rotational instability problem was resolved. She returned to sports 12 months after the surgery and has been pleased with her result. Key Concepts: (1) Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) can be added to increased rotational stability in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. (2) Although typically added during the index procedure, it can be successfully completed later if needed. (3) The ACL confers both anteroposterior and rotational stability to prevent excessive anterior translation and excessive internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur. (4) LET can augment the ACL graft in preventing rotational instability in the setting of an ACL-deficient knee.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.jposna.2025.100184,JOURNAL OF THE PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SOCIETY OF NORTH AMERICA

There is limited evidence on the effect of lateral extra-articular procedures in revision ACL surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients with lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) in combination with revision ACLR for combined ACL graft failure and high-grade anterior knee instability. Methods: Between 2016 and 2018, 75 patients with graft failure after primary ACLR and high-grade anterior knee instability who received revision ACLR were included in the retrospective study. High-grade anterior knee instability was defined as high-grade pivot-shift or side-to-sick difference of more than six millimeters in Rolimeter (R)-testing. An additional modified Lemaire tenodesis was performed in 59 patients during revision ACLR. Seventy-three patients were clinically examined with a minimum of two years after revision surgery. Results: Failure of the revision ACLR occurred in 8.2% (n = 6) of the cases. LET lead to significant decreased failure rates (five percent vs. 21%, p .045) and decreased incidence of a positive pivot-shift in patients with revision ACLR and high-grade anterior knee instability in comparison to patients without LET. Also, postoperative functional scores were significantly increased in the group of additional LET. Conclusions: Additional LET in patients with revision ACLR and high-grade anterior instability significantly reduces the risk of failure of revision ACLR, the incidence of pivot-shift and increases postoperative functional outcome.

(2021),2021,Anterolateral ligament reconstruction improves the clinical and functional outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in athletes,"Purpose To compare the outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with those of combined ACL and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction in ACL-deficient knees. The objective of this study was to improve knowledge regarding the treatment of ACL-deficient knees with combined ACL and ALL reconstruction. Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction has been hypothesized to result in better clinical and functional outcomes than isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Methods One-hundred and seven adult male athletes with ACL tears and high-grade pivot shifts were randomized into two groups. Those in group A (n = 54) underwent ACLR, while those in group B (n = 53) underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction. The median age was 26 (18-40) and 24 (18-33) years in groups A and B, respectively, and the median follow-up was 60 (55-65) months. Physical examination findings, instrumented knee laxity tested using a KT-1000 arthrometer, and International Knee Documentation Committee Scale (IKDC) scores were used to evaluate the outcomes. Results One-hundred and two patients were available for follow-up: 52 in group A and 50 in group B. Postoperatively, the pivot shift was normal in 43 (82.7%) and 48 (96%) patients in groups A and B, respectively (p < 0.001). The median instrumented knee laxity was 2.5 +/- 0.7 (1.2-6.1) mm in patients in group A and 1.2 +/- 0.7 (1.2-3.2) mm in patients in group B (p < 0.001). Additionally, 44 (84.6%) patients in group A had normal IKDC scores and 3 (5.8%) had nearly normal scores, while 48 (96.0%) patients in group B had normal IKDC scores and 2 (4%) had nearly normal scores (p < 0.001). Conclusion Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction, compared with isolated ACLR resulted in favourable clinical and functional outcomes, as demonstrated by decreased rotational instability and instrumented knee laxity, a lower graft rupture rate and better postoperative IKDC scores.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00167-020-06119-w,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
471,WS-95,Sood et al. (2020),2020,Poor Functional Outcome in Patients with Voluntary Knee Instability after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) remains the gold standard treatment for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, a good functional outcome even after a successful surgery depends on multiple factors. It has been observed that certain patients with a chronic ACL injury demonstrate knee instability voluntarily. The authors observed that these patients might not perform well even after a successful surgery. This study aims to assess the outcome after ACL and other ligament reconstruction in patients with voluntary knee instability. Methods: From a total of 824 patients who underwent ACLR, 13 patients with a history of voluntary knee instability were selected, and data of these patients (demographic and clinical profile) were obtained. Outcomes of surgery in this group of patients were evaluated by using Lysholm score and Tegner activity level. Results: All patients were young men with a chronic ACL injury and manifested instability. Associated injuries were lateral meniscus tear in 3 patients, medial meniscus tear in 2, and posterolateral corner (PLC) injury in 3. ACLR was done using the semitendinosus-gracilis graft in all patients. Further, anterolateral ligament reconstruction was done in 2 patients and PLC reconstruction, in 3 patients. The mean Lysholm score was 54.76 (range, 48-62) preoperatively and 60.92 (range, 54-78) at a mean follow-up of 14.3 months (range, 11-26 months). The median Tegner activity level was 6 (range, 5-7) before injury and 4 (range, 3-5) at the final follow-up. Twelve of the 13 patients were able to demonstrate instability voluntarily at the time of the final follow-up. Conclusions: In patients with ACL and other ligament injuries who demonstrated voluntary knee instability, the functional out-come even after successful ligament reconstruction was poor.",Web of Science,10.4055/cios19143,CLINICS IN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY
472,WS-96,Mayr et al. (2022),2022,Modified Lemaire tenodesis reduces anterior cruciate ligament graft forces during internal tibial torque loading,"Purpose The aim of the study was to directly measure graft forces of an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and a lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) using the modified Lemaire technique in combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficient and anterolateral rotatory instable knees and to analyse the changes in knee joint motion resulting from combined ACLR + LET. Methods On a knee joint test bench, six fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens were tested at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees of knee flexion in the following states: 1) intact; 2) with resected ACL; 3) with resected ACL combined with anterolateral rotatory instability; 4) with an isolated ACLR; and 5) with combined ACLR + LET. The specimens were examined under various external loads: 1) unloaded; 2) with an anterior tibial translation force (ATF) of 98 N; 3) with an internal tibial torque (IT) of 5 Nm; and 4) with a combined internal tibial torque of 5 Nm and an anterior tibial translation force of 98 N (IT + ATF). The graft forces of the ACLR and LET were recorded by load cells incorporated into custom devices, which were screwed into the femoral tunnels. Motion of the knee joint was analysed using a 3D camera system. Results During IT and IT + ATF, the addition of a LET reduced the ACLR graft forces up to 61% between 0 degrees and 60 degrees of flexion (P = 0.028). During IT + ATF, the LET graft forces reached 112 N. ACLR alone did not restore native internal tibial rotation after combined ACL deficiency and anterolateral rotatory instability. Combined ACLR + LET was able to restore native internal tibial rotation values for 0 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion with decreased internal tibial rotation at 30 degrees of flexion. Conclusion The study demonstrates that the addition of a LET decreases the forces seen by the ACLR graft and reduces residual rotational laxity after isolated ACLR during internal tibial torque loading. Due to load sharing, a LET could support the ACLR graft and perhaps be the reason for reduced repeat rupture rates seen in clinical studies. Care must be taken not to limit the internal tibial rotation when performing a LET.",Web of Science,10.1186/s40634-022-00484-w,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ORTHOPAEDICS

However, residual rotational instability of the knee joint remains a major concern. The anterolateral ligament (ALL) has recently gained interest as a secondary stabilizer of knee joint rotatory instability, and this has led to the attempt of ALL reconstruction (ALLR) in combination with ACLR to restore rotational stability in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Although several techniques for ALLR have recently been introduced, the ideal graft type and surgical technique for combined ACLR and ALLR are yet to be established. This technical note therefore aimed at introducing a novel surgical procedure involving the use of a single Achilles tendon allograft as a relatively simple and minimally invasive procedure for combined ALL and ACL reconstruction.",Web of Science,10.3390/medicina58070929,MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
474,WS-98,Nitri et al. (2016),2016,"An In Vitro Robotic Assessment of the Anterolateral Ligament, Part 2 Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Combined With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction","Background: Recent biomechanical studies have demonstrated that an extra-articular lateral knee structure, most recently referred to as the anterolateral ligament (ALL), contributes to overall rotational stability of the knee. However, the effect of anatomic ALL reconstruction (ALLR) in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) has not been biomechanically investigated or validated. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to investigate the biomechanical function of anatomic ALLR in the setting of a combined ACL and ALL injury. More specifically, this investigation focused on the effect of ALLR on resultant rotatory stability when performed in combination with concomitant ACLR. It was hypothesized that ALLR would significantly reduce internal rotation and axial plane translation laxity during a simulated pivot-shift test compared with isolated ACLR. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were evaluated with a 6 degrees of freedom robotic system. Knee kinematics were evaluated with simulated clinical examinations including a simulated pivot-shift test consisting of coupled 10-Nm valgus and 5-Nm internal rotation torques, a 5-Nm internal rotation torque, and an 88-N anterior tibial load. Kinematic differences between ACLR with an intact ALL, ACLR with ALLR, and ACLR with a deficient ALL were compared with the intact state. Single-bundle ACLR tunnels and ALLR tunnels were placed anatomically according to previous quantitative anatomic attachment descriptions. Results: Combined anatomic ALLR and ACLR significantly improved the rotatory stability of the knee compared with isolated ACLR in the face of a concurrent ALL deficiency. During a simulated pivot-shift test, ALLR significantly reduced internal rotation and axial plane tibial translation when compared with ACLR with an ALL deficiency. Isolated ACLR for the treatment of a combined ACL and ALL injury was not able to restore stability of the knee, resulting in a significant increase in residual internal rotation laxity. ALLR did not affect anterior tibial translation; no significant differences were observed between the varying ALL conditions with ACLR except between ACLR with an intact ALL and ACLR with a deficient ALL at 0 degrees of flexion. Conclusion: In the face of a combined ACL and ALL deficiency, concurrent ACLR and ALLR significantly improved the rotatory stability of the knee compared with solely reconstructing the ACL.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546515620183,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

(2019),2019,Combined Reconstruction of the Anterolateral Ligament in Patients With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury and Ligamentous Hyperlaxity Leads to Better Clinical Stability and a Lower Failure Rate Than Isolated Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Purpose: To compare functional outcomes, residual instability, and rupture rates in patients with ligamentous hyperlaxity undergoing isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction or combined ACL and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction. Methods: Two groups of patients were evaluated and compared retrospectively. Both groups consisted of patients with ACL injuries and associated ligamentous hyperlaxity, defined based on the modified Beighton scale with a minimum score of 5. Group 1 patients underwent anatomical ACL reconstruction, and group 2 patients underwent anatomical ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction. Group 1 consisted of historical controls. The presence of associated meniscal injury, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm functional scores, KT-1000 measurements, the presence of a residual pivot-shift, and the graft rupture rate were evaluated. The study was performed at University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. Results: Ninety patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with ligamentous hyperlaxity were evaluated. The mean follow up was 29.6 +/- 6.2 months for group 1 and 28.1 +/- 4.2 months for group 2 (P = .51). No significant differences were found between the groups regarding Beighton scale, gender, the duration of injury before reconstruction, follow-up time, preoperative instability, or associated meniscal injuries. The mean age was 29.9 +/- 8.1 years in group 1 and 27.0 +/- 9.1 years in group 2 (P = .017). In the final evaluation, group 2 patients showed better anteroposterior clinical stability as evaluated by KT-1000 arthrometry (P = .02), better rotational stability as evaluated by the pivot-shift test (P = .03) and a lower reconstruction failure rate (21.7% [group 1] vs 3.3% [group 2]; P = .03). Clinical evaluations of postoperative functional scales showed no differences between the 2 groups (P = .27 for International Knee Documentation Committee; P = .41 for Lysholm). Conclusions: Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction in patients with ligamentous hyperlaxity resulted in a lower failure rate and improved knee stability parameters compared to isolated ACL reconstruction.

(2020),2020,New insights in anterior cruciate ligament morphology: implications for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgeries,"The frequency of injury of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the importance of anatomy in surgical repair and potential of the injured ACL to predispose to osteoarthritis necessitates the need for understanding its precise anatomy. Available studies have focussed on tunnel positioning and hence attachment site of the ligament. Few studies which have focussed on morphology reflect ambiguities in size, fibre bundle, number and disposition. Since a near anatomical repair of the ACL is the treatment of choice, the present study was planned to describe the morphology of ACL. Twenty-two ACL (11 right and 11 left) isolated from knee joints of collection of adult embalmed lower limbs were utilised for the study. The ACL morphology and morphometry were studied for footprints and fibre bundles. Three distinct bundles of differing lengths constitute a spiral ACL complex. These bundles are positioned asintermediate with posteromedial and anterolateral flanking in respective positions. The tibial and femoral footprints are paw-shaped and oval respectively. Tibial footprints are approximately 2.5 times larger in area than the femoral footprints. The unique morphology of ACL vis a vis its spiralization, and its mechanical advantage of in terminal extension and conjunct rotation of knee (which are peculiarly human trait) are discussed. It is recommended to utilize the concept of spiralization and differing bundle length in ACL surgeries to achieve the favourable clinical outcome.",Web of Science,10.5115/acb.20.119,ANATOMY & CELL BIOLOGY

478,WS-102,Albers et al. (2017),2017,Individualized Anatomical Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury particularly among young active individuals. ACL injury leads to increased knee laxity and abnormal knee biomechanics that may prevent return to sports and predispose to early onset degenerative changes in the joint. Therefore, optimizing ACL injury treatment is of great interest to the sports medicine field. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is considered the treatment of choice for most patients, especially in those involved in cutting and pivoting activities, often allowing them to return sports. ACLR has been based traditionally on standardized techniques that neglected the individual anatomy of the patient. Individualized anatomical ACLR is considered a new concept that is based on tailoring the ACL surgery to the individual patient. It uses preoperative measurements on plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging as well as intraoperative measurement of the patients' native ACL and knee anatomy to precisely determine the variations in the size of femoral and tibial insertion site and size and morphology of the intercondylar notch. The ultimate goal of individualized anatomical ACL reconstruction is to restore the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion site to replicate the individual anatomy as closely as possible. In this concept, the choice to perform a single- or double-bundle reconstruction or augmentation depends on aforementioned variations in the anatomy of the ACL and the knee joint.

(2019),2019,Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using an anterior cruciate ligament stump,"Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury always leads to knee pain and dysfunction for which surgical reconstruction is recommended, with good clinical results, but decreased postoperative proprioception also tends to occur. ACL stump (ACLS)-retaining ACL reconstruction and non-ACLS-retaining ACL reconstruction are the two surgical options. Aim: To investigate the efficacy of retaining the ACLS in allograft reconstruction. Material and methods: Thirty patients were retrospectively assigned to group A, ACLS-retaining ACL reconstruction; and group B, non-ACLS-retaining ACL reconstruction, and their data were analyzed. The knee function (Lysholm score and Tegner motion score) and proprioceptive function of the two groups were assessed and compared by postoperative reconstruction angle. Results: The 30 patients were followed up for a mean 20 months. The mean Lysholm score in group A increased from 55.7 +/- 11.6 points preoperatively to 95.2 +/- 5.7 points postoperatively; that in group B increased from 56.7 +/- 11.3 points preoperatively to 94.6 +/- 7.2 points postoperatively. The mean Tegner motion score in group A was increased from 2.4 +/- 0.7 points preoperatively to 6.0 +/- 0.7 points postoperatively; that in group B increased from 2.73 +/- 0.96 points preoperatively to 6.24 +/- 0.48 points postoperatively; the postoperative scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. The proprioception was better in group A than in group B at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively (p < 0.05). Conclusions: ACLS-retaining ACL reconstruction has good efficacy and the retained ACLS can benefit postoperative proprioception recovery at an early stage.",Web of Science,10.5114/wiitm.2019.81305,VIDEOSURGERY AND OTHER MINIINVASIVE TECHNIQUES

Consequently, the ACL has always been and continues to be of great interest to orthopaedic scientists and clinicians worldwide. Major advancements in ACL surgery have been made in the past few years. ACL reconstruction has shifted from an open to arthroscopic procedure, in which a two- and later one-incision technique was applied. Studies have found that traditional, transtibial arthroscopic single-bundle reconstruction does not fully restore rotational stability of the knee joint, and as such, a more anatomic approach to ACL reconstruction has emerged. The goal of anatomic ACL reconstruction is to replicate the knee's normal anatomy and restore its normal kinematics, all while protecting long-term knee health.

483,WS-107,Hewett et al. (2013),2013,Current Concepts for Injury Prevention in Athletes After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Ligament reconstruction is the current standard of care for active patients with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Although the majority of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgeries successfully restore the mechanical stability of the injured knee, postsurgical outcomes remain widely varied. Less than half of athletes who undergo ACLR return to sport within the first year after surgery, and it is estimated that approximately 1 in 4 to 1 in 5 young, active athletes who undergo ACLR will go on to a second knee injury. The outcomes after a second knee injury and surgery are significantly less favorable than outcomes after primary injuries. As advances in graft reconstruction and fixation techniques have improved to consistently restore passive joint stability to the preinjury level, successful return to sport after ACLR appears to be predicated on numerous postsurgical factors. Importantly, a secondary ACL injury is most strongly related to modifiable postsurgical risk factors. Biomechanical abnormalities and movement asymmetries, which are more prevalent in this cohort than previously hypothesized, can persist despite high levels of functional performance, and also represent biomechanical and neuromuscular control deficits and imbalances that are strongly associated with secondary injury incidence. Decreased neuromuscular control and high-risk movement biomechanics, which appear to be heavily influenced by abnormal trunk and lower extremity movement patterns, not only predict first knee injury risk but also reinjury risk. These seminal findings indicate that abnormal movement biomechanics and neuromuscular control profiles are likely both residual to, and exacerbated by, the initial injury. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) strategies should be used to develop effective, efficacious interventions targeted to these impairments to optimize the safe return to high-risk activity. In this Current Concepts article, the authors present the latest evidence related to risk factors associated with ligament failure or a secondary (contralateral) injury in athletes who return to sport after ACLR. From these data, they propose an EBM paradigm shift in postoperative rehabilitation and return-to-sport training after ACLR that is focused on the resolution of neuromuscular deficits that commonly persist after surgical reconstruction and standard rehabilitation of athletes.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546512459638,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

Methods: A consecutive cohort of 750 patients who had undergone primary ACL reconstruction surgery with a minimum 3-year follow-up were questioned about the incidence of ACL graft rupture, contralateral ACL injury, family history of ACL injury, and current activity level. Patient databases provided details for age, sex, original injury mechanism, meniscus or articular surface injury, and graft diameter. Results: Responses were received from 561 patients (75%) at a mean SD follow-up time of 4.8 +/- 1.1 years. Anterior cruciate ligament graft ruptures occurred in 25 patients (4.5%), and contralateral ACL injuries occurred in 42 patients (7.5%). The highest incidence of further ACL injury occurred in patients younger than 20 years at the time of surgery. In this group, 29% sustained a subsequent ACL injury to either knee. The odds for sustaining an ACL graft rupture or contralateral injury increased 6- and 3-fold, respectively, for patients younger than 20 years. Returning to cutting/pivoting sports increased the odds of graft rupture by a factor of 3.9 and contralateral rupture by a factor of 5. A positive family history doubled the odds for both graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury. Conclusion: Patients younger than 20 years who undergo ACL reconstruction are at significantly increased risk for both graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury. Whether age per se is a risk factor or age represents a proxy for other factors remains to be determined.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546513517540,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
487,WS-111,Devgan et al. (2015),2015,Arthroscopic anatomical double bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective longitudinal study,"Background: Single bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has been the current standard of treatment for ACL deficiency. However, a significant subset of patients continue to report residual symptoms of instability with a poor pivot control. Cadaveric biomechanical studies have shown double bundle (DB) ACL reconstructions to restore the knee kinematics better. This study evaluates the outcome of DB ACL reconstruction. Materials and Methods: 30 consecutive patients who underwent anatomic DB ACL reconstruction were included in this prospective longitudinal study. There were all males with a mean age of 25 +/- 7.45 years. All patients were prospectively evaluated using GeNouRoB (GNRB) arthrometer, functional knee scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Lysholm) and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for comparing the graft orientation and footprint of the reconstructed ACL with that of the normal knee. Results: The average followup was 36.2 months. At the time of final followup the mean Lysholm score was 93.13 +/- 3.31. As per the objective IKDC score, 26 patients (86.6%) were in Group A while 4 patients (13.3%) were in Group B. The mean differential anterior tibial translation by GNRB, arthrometer was 1.07 +/- 0.8 mm (range 0.1-2.3 mm). All cases had a negative pivot shift test. MRI scans of operated and the contralateral normal knee showed the mean sagittal ACL tibial angle coronal ACL tibial angle and tibial ACL footprint to be in accordance with the values of the contralateral, normal knee. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that DB ACL reconstruction restores the ACL anatomically in terms of size and angle of orientation. However, long term studies are needed to further substantiate its role in decreasing the incidence of early osteoarthritic changes compared to the conventional single bundle reconstructions.",Web of Science,10.4103/0019-5413.152406,INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS
488,WS-112,Rabuck et al. (2012),2012,Individualized Anatomic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) is a technique that continues to evolve. Good results have been established with respect to reducing anteroposterior laxity. However, these results have come into question because nonanatomic techniques have been ineffective at restoring knee kinematics and raised concerns that abnormal kinematics may impact long-term knee health. Anatomic ACL-R attempts to closely reproduce the patient's individual anatomic characteristics. Measurements of the patient's anatomy help determine graft choice and whether anatomic reconstruction should be performed with a single-or double-bundle technique. The bony landmarks and insertions of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are preserved to assist with anatomic placement of both tibial and femoral tunnels. An anatomic single-or double-bundle reconstruction is performed with a goal of reproducing the characteristics of the native ACL. Long-term outcomes for anatomic ACL reconstruction are unknown. By individualizing ACL-R, we strive to reproduce the patient's native anatomy and restore knee kinematics to improve patient outcomes.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.eats.2011.12.004,ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES

A PROSPECTIVE EVALUATION WITH A MINIMUM THREE-YEAR FOLLOW-UP,"We have shown in a previous study that patients with combined lesions of the anterior cruciate (ACL) and medial collateral ligaments (MCL) had similar anteroposterior (AP) but greater valgus laxity at 30 degrees after reconstruction of the ACL when compared with patients who had undergone reconstruction of an isolated ACL injury. The present study investigated the same cohort of patients after a minimum of three years to evaluate whether the residual valgus laxity led to a poorer clinical outcome. Each patient had undergone an arthroscopic double-bundle ACL reconstruction using a semitendinosus-gracilis graft. In the combined ACL/MCL injury group, the grade II medial collateral ligament injury was not treated. At follow-up, AP laxity was measured using a KT-2000 arthrometer, while valgus laxity was evaluated with Telos valgus stress radiographs and compared with the uninjured knee. We evaluated clinical outcome scores, muscle girth and time to return to activities for the two groups. Valgus stress radiographs showed statistically significant greater mean medial joint opening in the reconstructed compared with the uninjured knees (1.7 mm (SD 0.9) versus 0.9 mm (SD 0.7), respectively, p = 0.013), while no statistically significant difference was found between the AP laxity and the other clinical parameters. Our results show that the residual valgus laxity does not affect AP laxity significantly at a minimum follow up of three years, suggesting that no additional surgical procedure is needed for the medial collateral ligament in combined lesions.",Web of Science,10.1302/0301-620X.93B8.26183,JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-BRITISH VOLUME
490,WS-114,Chen et al. (1999),1999,Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft,"Background: Surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is indicated in the ACL-deficient knee with symptomatic instability and multiple ligaments injuries. Bone patellar tendon-bone and the hamstring tendon generally have been used. In the present study, we describe an alternative graft, the quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft, by using arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Methods: From March of 1996 through March of 1997, a quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft was used in 12 patients with ACL injuries, Results: After 15 to 24 months of follow-up, the clinical outcome for those patients with this graft have been encouraging. Ten patients could return to the same or a higher level of preinjury sports activity. According to the International Knee Documentation Committee rating system, 10 of the 12 patients had normal or nearly normal ratings. Recovery of quadriceps muscle strength to 80% of the normal knee was achieved in 11 patients in 1 year, Conclusion: The advantages of the quadriceps tendon graft include the following: the graft is larger and stronger than the patellar tendon; morbidity of harvest technique and donor site is less than that of patellar tendon graft; there is little quadriceps inhibition after quadriceps harvest: there is quicker return to sports activities with aggressive rehabilitation. A quadriceps tendon-patellar autograft is a reasonable alternative to ACL reconstruction in patients who are not suitable for either a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft.",Web of Science,10.1097/00005373-199904000-00020,JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
491,WS-115,Hofbauer et al. (2013),2013,Anatomic Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Over the past decade, intense research of the function of the 2 distinct bundles, the anteromedial and posterolateral, of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has led to pronounced changes in the technical concepts of ACL reconstruction. Recently, the renewed focus of ACL reconstruction has been to restore the anatomy of the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion sites. The goal of ACL reconstruction is to restore normal knee kinematics, to enable patients to return to their preinjury level of activity, and to prevent further degenerative changes of the articular knee cartilage. Anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction has recently gained popularity as a concept that can be used to achieve these goals. This article provides an overview of the anatomy and function of the ACL. Furthermore, we highlight individual anatomic considerations as they pertain to ACL reconstruction and describe the technique for anatomical ACL reconstruction.

492,WS-116,van Eck et al. (2011),2011,Current Concepts in Anatomic Single- and Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is one of the most common orthopedic sport injuries. The ACL consists of 2 functional bundles the anteromedial and posterolateral which are named for the position of their insertion sites on the tibia. Anatomic ACL reconstruction can be defined as the restoration of the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion sites. Some biomechanical studies have demonstrated that anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore knee motion significantly similar to that of the normal knee, as compared with traditional, nonanatomic single-bundle procedures. In vivo kinematic studies have also shown that nonanatomic single-bundle reconstruction fails to restore normal dynamic knee stability in all cases. Accurate restoration of knee kinematics with anatomic ACL reconstruction is critical to protect against the possibility that nonatomic sugical technique could result in early osteoarthritis, which is common in patients who sustain ACL tears. Surgical techniques for ACL reconstruction vary, and if different aspects of the surgery are compared for superiority (eg, single- vs double-bundle techniques), it is necessary that both procedures meet criteria to be designated as anatomic. By emphasizing the importance of restoring the native anatomy of the knee, surgeons can give their patients the best chance at restoration of joint function and preservation of long-term knee health.",Web of Science,10.3810/psm.2011.05.1905,PHYSICIAN AND SPORTSMEDICINE
493,WS-117,Christel et al. (2005),2005,Anatomic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: The French Experience,"Anatomical observation and biomechanical studies have shown that the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) mainly consists of 2 distinct bundles, the anteromedial bundle (AMB) and posterolateral bundle (PLB). These 2 bundles have different roles in the control of knee stability. The AMB essentially controls the anterior tibial translation, whereas the PLB mainly controls the rotatory stability of the knee by limiting the internal rotation of the lateral tibial plateau. Current techniques for reconstruction do not completely reproduce the anatomy and function of the ACL. They address only the anteromedial bundle, which does not fully restore ACL function throughout the arc of motion. Current grafts control the anterior tibial subluxation near extension but are less efficacious in providing rotatory stability. Recently several authors have suggested reconstructing not only the anteromedial bundle, but also the posterolateral bundle. After discussing the relevant anatomical and biomechanical data, this article describes a double-bundle ACL reconstruction technique using hamstring tendons routed through 2 tibial and 2 femoral independent tunnels. Short-term results of this technique are encouraging; however, long-term follow-up studies are needed to compare the outcome of a more physiologic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with single-bundle techniques.",Web of Science,10.1053/j.oto.2004.11.008,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES IN ORTHOPAEDICS

In the significant proportion of patients after the traditional single-bundle ACLR, complaints of instability still continue. Anatomic double bundle ACLR may provide normal kinematics in knees, much closer to the natural anatomy. The aim of this study is to clinically assess the early outcomes of our anatomical double bundle ACLR. Material and Method: In our clinic between June 2009 and March 2010, performed the anatomic double bundle ACLR with autogenous hamstring grafts 20 patients were evaluated prospectively with Cincinnati, IKDC and Lysholm scores and in clinically for muscle strength and with Cybex II dynamometer. Results: The mean follow-up is 17.8 months (13-21 months). Patients' scores of Cincinnati, IKDC and Lysholm were respectively, preoperative 18.1, 39.3 and 39.8, while the post-op increased to 27.2, 76.3 and 86.3. In their last check, 17 percent of the patients according to IKDC scores (85%) A (excellent) and B (good) group and 3 patients took place as C (adequate) group. The power measurements of quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups of patients who underwent surgery showed no significant difference compared with the intact knees.

No consensus exists regarding the best treatment method. This work presents a method of 1-stage ACL and PCL reconstruction in which a contralateral quadriceps tendon-bone autograft with tibial inlay technique is used for the PCL and contralateral hamstring tendon autograft with suspension fixation is used for the ACL. After harvesting grafts, the patient is put in the lateral decubitus position. Under arthroscopy, the femoral tunnel for the anterolateral bundle of the PCL is created using an 8-mm reamer via a prepositioned guide pin. Next, the tibial tunnel of the ACL is created with an appropriate diameter cannulated reamer. Directed by the femoral guide instrument with a 7-mm offset, a guide pin is positioned retrograde through the tibial tunnel. A reamer is then used to create a 35-mm long closed-ended femoral tunnel for the ACL. A posterior arthrotomy for the PCL inlay technique is performed. After capsulotomy, a unicortical window is created at the footprint of the PCL and the inlay graft is fixed using a 3.5mm-cancellous screw and washer. The PCL graft is then passed into the femoral tunnel. The ACL graft is passed in a retrograde fashion using the Beath pin. The ACL graft is fixed by tying with a washer on the femoral side and by tying with a screw on the tibial side. The PCL graft is then fixed on the femoral side.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.artho.2005.11.012,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY

It was hypothesized that anatomic DB ACLR would result in better International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) scores and reduced anterior and rotatory laxity compared to SB ACLR. Methods Active individuals between 14 and 50 years of age that presented within 12 months of injury were eligible to participate. Individuals with prior injury or surgery of either knee, greater than a grade 1 concomitant knee ligament injury, or ACL insertion sites less than 14 mm or greater than 18 mm were excluded. Subjects were randomized to undergo SB or DB ACLR with a 10 mm-wide quadriceps tendon autograft harvested with a patellar bone block and were followed for 24 months. The primary outcome measures included the IKDC-SKF and KT-1000 (side to side difference) and pivot shift tests. Other secondary outcomes included measures of sports activity and participation, range of motion (ROM) and re-injury. Results Enrollment in the study was suspended due to patellar fractures related to harvest of the patellar bone plug. At that time, 57 subjects had been randomized (29 DB) and two-year follow-up was attained from 51 (89.5%).

Although anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has come a long way, the causes of failure have yet to be fully understood. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not the intraoperative 4-strand hamstring autograft diameter does in fact influence the failure rates of ACLR. Methods: Retrospective intraoperative data were collected from ACLR patients from the only tertiary center available in Kuwait. Patients who underwent ACLR from 2012 to 2018 for isolated ACL injuries were included in this study, allowing for a 24 month follow-up period The cohorts were categorized into 3 groups: patients with graft size <= 8mm, 2, patients with graft sizes >= 8mm with 4-strands and patients with graft sizes >= 8mm with 4-strands or more. ANOVA analysis was applied to address group differences between mean graft size and strand numbers and subsequently the failure rates for each group. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to investigate the relationship between revision and initial ACL graft size. Results: Out of the 711 out of 782 patients were included in this study. Only 42.6% of the patients did not need more than 4-strands to achieve an 8mm sized autograft. The patients who had autografts <= 8mm in this study accounted for 17.1% of the population. About 7.2% of these patients required revision surgery. Patients with a 4-strand autograft size that was less than 8mm were 7.2 times more at risk for ACLR failure (RR=7.2, 95% CI: 6.02; 8.35, p=0.007).

502,WS-126,Kopf et al. (2011),2011,Size Variability of the Human Anterior Cruciate Ligament Insertion Sites,"Background: Current trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have been toward anatomical reconstruction that restores the normal size and location of the anterior cruciate ligament insertions and its 2 bundles, the posterolateral (PL) and anteromedial (AM) bundles. This has resulted in a more individualized approach to ACLR. Several studies have shown that the size of the anterior cruciate ligament insertion sites is variable; however, these studies are limited by use of relatively small sample sizes and cadaveric specimens. Purpose: This study was undertaken to evaluate the in vivo size variability of the anterior cruciate ligament insertion sites and its AM and PL bundles during arthroscopy in a large series of patients and to correlate these findings with individuals' physical characteristics (height, weight, and body mass index). Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: In 137 patients undergoing ACLR during the first 6 months after injury, the femoral and tibial anterior cruciate ligament insertion sites and the 2 bundles were identified, marked with electrocautery, and measured with an arthroscopic ruler. Additionally, physical characteristics of the patients, including self-reported height, weight, and body mass index, were recorded. Results: The tibial anterior cruciate ligament insertion site had a mean length of 17.0 +/- 2.0 mm. The tibial AM bundle length was 9.1 +/- 1.2 mm and the width was 9.2 +/- 1.1 mm. The tibial PL bundle insertion site length averaged 7.4 +/- 1.0 mm and the width averaged 7.0 +/- 1.0 mm. The femoral insertion sites had a mean length of 16.5 +/- 2.0 mm. The length of the femoral AM bundle insertion site averaged 9.2 +/- 1.2 mm and the width averaged 8.9 +/- 0.9 mm. The femoral PL bundle insertion site length averaged 7.1 +/- 1.1 mm and the width averaged 6.9 +/- 1.0 mm. There were significant positive correlations between patient height and weight (P < .05) with femoral and tibial anterior cruciate ligament insertion site length, tibial PL bundle insertion site length, femoral AM bundle insertion site length, and tibial AM bundle and PL bundle insertion site areas. However, the coefficients of determination values were low (1.0% to 19.4%). Conclusion: There is a large variation in size of the anterior cruciate ligament insertion sites and the AM and PL bundles.

Clinical information was retrospectively collected for 41 cases suffering anterior cruciate ligament injuries accompanied by grade 2 medial collateral ligament injuries. Within 14 days after their injuries 22 cases received single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (SB group), while 19 were treated with double-bundle medial collateral ligament reconstruction (DB group). Physical statuses were estimated based on International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, Lachman, pivot shift and manual valgus test, and range of motion (ROM), while side-to-side difference was estimated through KT 2000 arthometer. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction accompanied by conservative treatment showed significantly improved anteroposterior, rotational and valgus stability, and IKDC and Lysholm scores (in comparison to pre-operative status, P < .05). Incidence of pivot shift was dramatically lower in DB group (2/19) than in SB group (7/22 and 2/22; P = .028). No substantial dissimilarity existed between DB and SB groups either in Lachman and valgus tests, KT 2000, ROM, IKDC, or Lysholm scores. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction accompanied by conservative treatment could achieve outstanding stability and functional manifestations for cases facing anterior cruciate ligament injury accompanied by grade 2 medial collateral ligament injury.

504,WS-128,Karlsson et al. (2011),2011,"Anatomic Single- and Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Part 2 Clinical Application of Surgical Technique","The anterior cruciate ligament has been and is of great interest to scientists and orthopaedic surgeons worldwide. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was initially performed using an open approach. When the approach changed from open to arthroscopic reconstruction, a 2- and, later, 1-incision technique was applied. With time, researchers found that traditional arthroscopic single-bundle reconstruction did not fully restore rotational stability of the knee joint and a more anatomic approach to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament has been proposed. Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction intends to replicate normal anatomy, restore normal kinematics, and protect long-term knee health. Although double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has been shown to result in better rotational stability in both biomechanical and clinical studies, it is vital to differentiate between anatomic and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The latter is merely a step closer to reproducing the native anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament; however, it can still be done nonanatomically. To evaluate the potential benefits of reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament in an anatomic fashion, accurate, precise, and reliable outcome measures are needed. These include, for example, T2 magnetic resonance imaging mapping of cartilage and quantification of graft healing on magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, there is a need for a consensus on which patient-reported outcome measures should be used to facilitate homogeneous reporting of outcomes.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546511402660,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

Methods: We report the current clinical outcomes of the initial 100 consecutive patients who underwent anatomic doublebundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an average follow-up of 2.1 +/- 0.5 years. All patients were prospectively followed to document range of motion, ligamentous laxity, and functional strength, as well as activity and sports participation. Results: Side-to-side difference in range of motion was 2 degrees +/- 3 degrees for extension and 2 degrees +/- 5 degrees for flexion. Sixty-five percent of patients had a normal Lachman test result, and 33% were nearly normal. For the pivot-shift test findings, 94% were normal, and 6% were nearly normal. The average side-to-side difference in the KT-2000 arthrometer test was 1.0 +/- 2.3 mm. There were 8 graft failures, 7 of which had subsequent revision surgery. No patients reported pain, swelling, or instability during activities of daily living, and 73% to 78% had no symptoms during very strenuous or strenuous sports activities. The scores of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form, Activities of Daily Living, and Sports Activity Scores of the Knee Outcome Survey were 85.0, 91.8, and 87.0, respectively, and were similar compared with patients undergoing single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which we have previously reported.

Patients with concomitant instability and those with alterations in the weightbearing axis of the lower limbs were not included. Sixty patients were followed from 24 to 72 months: 50 clinically and 10 by a phone interview. Six patients were lost to follow-up due to changes of address. Results: Lysholm scores were 57% excellent (95-100 points), 13% good (84-94 points), 22% fair (63-83 points), and 8% poor (<64 points). A total of 68% of patients had negative Lachman tests, 20% had positive tests with a hard end point, 10% had positive results, and 2% had very positive results. Stabilometric evaluation with the KT-1000 arthrometer at the maximum load showed that 56% of patients had <3 mm side-to-side difference, 34% had between 3 and 5 mm, and 10% had 6 to 10 mm. The International Knee Documentation Committee scores were 36% excellent (class A), 46% good (class B), and 18% fair (class C). The percentage of patients who resumed sport at the same level was 78%, compared with 58% after their primary reconstruction. Conclusion: The results of these anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction revision surgeries are close to those achieved by other series of primary reconstructions with a little less satisfactory results. We attribute the high success rate to the strict application of the same technique and the confinement of revision to motivated patients. It should be noted, however, that follow-up is only at the midterm stage (mean, 41.9 months).",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546508318189,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
507,WS-131,Cha et al. (2005),2005,Arthroscopic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: An anatomic approach - art. no. E1,"The anterior cruciate ligament consists of 2 functional bundles, the anteromedial and the posterolateral bundle. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has traditionally focused on recreating the anteromedial bundle, while the reconstruction of the posteromedial bundle has not routinely been addressed. The authors, from 2 academic centers, present a technique of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction that restores both the anteromedial and the posterolateral bundle using either semitendinosus and gracilis autografts or tibialis anterior allografts. This technique represents a novel approach to restore the anteromedial and the posterolateral bundle at their anatomic insertion sites on both the tibia and the femur through separate bone tunnels. We believe that our double-bundle anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction closely reapproximates the native insertion sites of the anterior cruciate ligament on the tibia and the femur while more closely recreating the biomechanical function of the native ligament.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.arthro.2005.07.018,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY

Purpose: To assess clinical outcome for patients with chronic anterior cruciate ligament injury and accompanying grade II valgus laxity who received medial hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction alone. Results were compared with those of patients with isolated chronic anterior cruciate ligament injury without valgus laxity. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Two hundred eighty-nine patients with isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury were compared with 53 patients with accompanying valgus laxity (minimum follow-up, 24 months). The following parameters were compared between the 2 groups at the last follow-up: range of motion, KT-1000 arthrometer value, pivot-shift test result, Lysholm knee scale, knee extensor muscle strength, return to sporting activities, subjective recovery, and International Knee Documentation Committee grade. Differences in clinical outcome were evaluated between those with preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee grade 8 and grade C and between those with grade A and grade B or C at final evaluation. Results: Postoperative KT-1 000 arthrometer value averaged 1.2 mm for those with isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury and 1.6 mm for those with accompanying valgus laxity (not significant, P =.281). There was no significant difference between these 2 groups regarding the other items. In patients with preoperative valgus laxity, KT-1000 arthrometer values at final evaluation between patients with preoperative grade B and C were not significantly different. The value for subjects with grade A at final evaluation was 1.3 mm and for those with grade B or C at final evaluation was 2.7 mm (P =.065). Conclusion: There was no clinically significant difference regarding outcome of anterior cruciate ligament multistrand hamstring reconstruction alone for 90% of patients with grade II valgus laxity who regained medial stability with nonoperative management compared with those who underwent the same anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for an isolated anterior cruciate ligament tear.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546507307501,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

(2023),2023,"Challenging the Perceptions of Human Tendon Allografts: Influence of Donor Age, Sex, Height, and Tendon on Biomechanical Properties","Background: The use of allograft tendons has increased for primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but allograft supply is currently limited to a narrow range of tendons and donors up to the age of 65 years. Expanding the range of donors and tendons could help offset an increasing clinical demand. Purpose: To investigate the effects of donor age, sex, height, and specific tendon on the mechanical properties of a range of human lower leg tendons. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Nine tendons were retrieved from 39 fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs (35 donors [13 female, 22 male]; age, 49-99 years; height, 57-85 inches [145-216 cm]) including: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior and anterior, fibularis longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, and flexor digitorum longus. Tendons underwent tensile loading to failure measuring cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum load, strain at failure, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus. Results from 332 tendons were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for donor age, sex, height, and weight. Results: Mechanical properties were significantly different among tendons and were substantially greater than the effects of donor characteristics. Significant effects of donor sex, age, and height were limited to specific tendons: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior, and tibialis anterior. All other tendons were unaffected. The Achilles tendon was most influenced by donor variables: greater CSA in men (beta = 15.45 mm(2); Sidak adjusted P < .0001), decreased maximum load with each year of increased age (beta = -17.20 N per year; adjusted P = .0253), and increased CSA (beta = 1.92 mm(2) per inch; adjusted P < .0001) and maximum load (beta = 86.40 N per inch; adjusted P < .0001) with each inch of increased height. Conclusion: Mechanical properties vary significantly across different human tendons. The effects of donor age, sex, and height are relatively small, are limited to specific tendons, and affect different tendons uniquely. The findings indicate that age negatively affected only the Achilles tendon (maximum load) and challenge the exclusion of donors aged >65 years across all tendon grafts.",Web of Science,10.1177/03635465221143385,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

Isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may not always restore rotatory stability of the knee. In these patients, additional procedures, such as lateral reconstruction or tenodesis, may be indicated. The anatomy of the anterolateral structures of the knee has been well described. Histologic and anatomic studies have reported conflicting findings regarding the presence of a discrete ligament.

513,WS-137,Soni et al. (2024),2024,Functional Outcomes in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction: A Nine-Month Follow-up Study Using Lysholm Score in a Rural Tertiary Care Center in India,"Introduction The knee joint, an extraordinary feat of biomechanics, is prone to injuries, with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) often being a common victim. The intricate coordination of joint movements relies heavily on the ACL's screw -home mechanism, a crucial element for synchronizing knee movement with neighboring joints. Despite its indispensable role, the ACL is susceptible to injury, necessitating surgical intervention. While many patients experience positive outcomes following ACL reconstruction surgeries, a significant proportion face the challenge of procedure failure. The key to success lies in the healing process within the tibial and femoral bone tunnels. The post-ACL reconstruction phase introduces its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of returning to sports (RTS), underscoring the importance of reinstating neuromuscular and motor function. The trajectory of rehabilitation is influenced by factors such as graft healing, patient age, gender, pain levels, and concurrent injuries. Materials and methods This prospective observational study spanned 2.5 years, enrolling 71 patients with diagnosed ACL injuries. Arthroscopic reconstruction utilized hamstring autografts and peroneus longus autografts. A nine -month post -surgery follow-up employed the Lysholm scoring system for comprehensive evaluations. Results Over 2.5 years, 87.3% of male and 12.6% of female participants underwent arthroscopic reconstruction. Lysholm scores revealed 28.1% excellent, 45.0% good, and 26.7% fair outcomes, with no participants in the unsatisfactory range. Lysholm scores demonstrated positive outcomes, indicating the efficacy of arthroscopic reconstruction in enhancing knee function. Findings align with existing literature, emphasizing positive results from ACL reconstruction techniques and specific implants. Comparisons with related studies highlight challenges in standardized return -to -sport guidelines and underscore the need for outcome measure standardization. Conclusion The study contributes nuanced insights into ACL reconstruction outcomes, emphasizing positive functional recovery trends at the nine -month follow-up. Lysholm scores indicate favorable outcomes, supporting the procedure's effectiveness. Consideration of specific implants adds practical value. Despite limitations, this study enriches ACL reconstruction research, promoting advancements in patient care and outcomes. Ongoing research with extended follow-ups and larger cohorts will enhance understanding and refine ACL reconstruction strategies.",Web of Science,10.7759/cureus.53480,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE

(2022),2022,Effect of Sectioning of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Posterolateral Structures on Lateral Compartment Gapping: A Randomized Biomechanical Study,"Background: The contribution of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to lateral instability under varus stress, particularly compared with posterolateral structures, is not well known. Purpose: To investigate the effect of sectioning the ACL and posterolateral knee structures on lateral compartment gapping under varus stress. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fourteen nonpaired cadaveric knees were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: sequential sectioning of the ACL, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) (ACL-first group) or sequential sectioning of the FCL, PLT, PFL, and ACL (FCL-first group). Knees were loaded onto a custom jig at a 20 degrees flexion angle. A standardized 12-N center dot m varus moment was applied to each specimen in the intact state and after each randomized sequential-sectioning state. Lateral compartment opening was measured on radiographs to assess the contribution to the increase in the lateral gap caused by resecting the respective structure. The distance was measured by 3 observers on 15 images (5 testing states each imaged 3 times) per specimen, for a total of 210 radiographs. The articular cartilage surfaces were not included in the measurements. Results: The mean increase in lateral opening after sectioning all structures (ACL and posterolateral corner) was 4.6 +/- 1.8 mm (range, 1.9-7.7 mm). The ACL and FCL sectioning contributed the most to lateral knee opening (1.3 +/- 0.6 and 2.2 +/- 1.3 mm, respectively). In both groups, lateral gapping >3 mm was achieved only after both the ACL and FCL were sectioned. All comparisons of increased mean gapping distances demonstrated a significant difference with subsequent sequential sectioning of structures, except comparisons between the FCL and PLT and the PLT and PFL. When considering the effect of the ACL on lateral opening, no significant difference was found between sectioning the ACL first or FCL first (P = .387). Conclusion: ACL deficiency significantly increased lateral opening under varus stress, regardless of the sequence of injury. The effect of injury to the ACL in addition to the lateral structures should be considered when using varus stress radiographs to evaluate knee injuries.",Web of Science,10.1177/23259671221100216,ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
516,WS-140,Perry et al. (2022),2022,"Determining the Roles of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Posterolateral Corner, and Medial Collateral Ligament in Knee Hyperextension Using the Heel-Height Test","Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are often associated with other ligamentous injuries. The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. Purpose: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-N center dot m force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P = .863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 +/- 0.83-cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL-posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 +/- 1.02-cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 +/- 1.35-cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P = .154). Conclusion: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height.",Web of Science,10.1177/23259671221086669,ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
517,WS-141,Blanke et al. (2024),2024,An anteromedial stabilization procedure has the most protective effect on the anterior cruciate ligament in tibial external rotation. A human knee model study,"Introduction Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains associated with the risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces.Methods Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case.Results The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation.Conclusion This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00402-024-05357-8,ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY
518,WS-142,Trentacosta et al. (2020),2020,Biomechanical Evaluation of Pediatric Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Techniques With and Without the Anterolateral Ligament (ALL),"Background: Two popular physeal-sparing procedures used in the management of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in skeletally immature patients are the iliotibial band (ITB) ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and the all-epiphyseal (AE) ACLR. Although there has been concern for overconstraint of the lateral compartment of the knee with the ITB ACLR technique, rotational stability, as provided by the anterolateral ligament (ALL) and ACL, has not been assessed in the setting of pediatric ACLR techniques. Our hypothesis is that the ITB ACLR and AE ACLR with ALL reconstruction (ALLR) will best replicate the biomechanical profile of the intact ACL that is lost with transection of the ACL and ALL. Methods: Eight cadaveric legs were statically loaded with an anterior drawer force and varus, valgus, internal and external rotational moments at 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees of flexion. Displacement and rotation were recorded in the following conditions: intact ACL/intact ALL, ACL-deficient/intact ALL, ITB ACLR/intact ALL, ITB ACLR/ALL-deficient, ACL-deficient/ALL-deficient, AE ACLR/ALL-deficient, AE ACLR/ALLR. Results: Both ACLR techniques reduced anterior tibial translation from the ACL-deficient state, but neither restored it to the intact state (P<0.05), except in full extension. ALL deficiency increased anterior tibial translation in the ACL-deficient state (P<0.05). In rotational testing, no significant increase was seen with transection of the ACL, but the ACL-deficient/ALL-deficient state had a significant increase in internal rotation (P<0.05). This was significantly restored to the intact state at most flexion angles with the ITB ACLR without rotational overconstraint of the lateral compartment. The AE ACLR/ALL-deficient state and AE ACLR/ALLR improved rotational stability at lower flexion angles, but not at 60 and 90 degrees. There were no significant changes in varus/valgus moments. Conclusions: In this model, the ITB ACLR provided the superior biomechanical profile between our tested reconstructions. It best corrected both AP and rotatory stability without overconstraining the knee. The AE ACLR and AE ACLR/ALLR improved both parameters but not at all flexion angles and not as robustly. ACL deficiency in the knee increased anterior tibial translation, but did not affect rotatory stability. ALL deficiency in the knee increased anterior displacement and rotational moments in the ACL-deficient state.",Web of Science,10.1097/BPO.0000000000001078,JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS

Methods Ninety-four consecutive patients (mean age 15.7 +/- 1.5 years) with at least 2 years of follow-up, who underwent ACL reconstruction with a single-bundle plus lateral-plasty hamstring technique in the same centre were included. Subsequent ACL injuries (ipsilateral ACL revision or contralateral ACL reconstruction) were assessed within the first 2 years after surgery. Anterior, central, posterior TPS of medial compartment were measured on lateral radiographs and compared between patients with intact graft and those with a second injury. Cut-off values with sensitivity and specificity were calculated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Survival analysis for second ACL injuries and multivariate analysis were performed. Results Eight patients (9%) had ipsilateral ACL Revision and eight patients (9%) had contralateral ACL reconstruction. Patients with contralateral injury had a higher Central TPS with respect to those without second injury (12.6 degrees +/- 2.8 degrees vs 9.3 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees,p = 0.042). No differences were present in patients with ipsilateral ACL revision. Sensitivity and specificity for central TPS slope >= 12 degrees to detect a contralateral rupture were 63% and 75% (p = 0.0092), for Anterior TPS were 100% and 52% (p = 0.0009). Patients with TPS values exceeding these cut-offs had higher rate of contralateral ACL injuries (19%vs4%,p = 0.0420) and lower 2-year survival (p = 0.0049). Multivariate analysis identified pre-operative sport level and TPS (either anterior or central) as risk factors for contralateral injuries. Conclusions Steep tibial plateau slope >= 12 degrees is associated with a higher risk of contralateral ACL injury within 2 years after ACL reconstruction in patients less than 18 years of age. However, TPS has no role in early ipsilateral re-injury after combined ACL reconstruction and lateral plasty. The clinical relevance is that both the surgeon and the patient should be aware of this higher risk and consider it in the rehabilitation phase to reduce the incidence of such injuries.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00167-020-06195-y,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY

The objective of this study is to report the results of a revision ACL reconstruction technique with a tibial tunnel performed from the anterolateral plateau associated with an anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction. Methods Patients with at least two ACL reconstructions that failed and who had significant enlargement and confluence of tunnels in the medial tibial plateau and underwent revision ACL reconstruction associated with ALL reconstruction with the tibial tunnel for the ACL performed from the lateral plateau between 2017 and 2019 were evaluated. All patients were evaluated by physical examination, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Lysholm functional scales. Results Six patients who underwent this surgical procedure were evaluated. All patients were sports practitioners and presented a grade 3 pivot shift. The mean age was 28.5 +/- 8.2 years, and the mean follow-up time was 34.1 +/- 12.8 months. No patient had a new graft rupture, but three (50%) had grade 1 pivot shift. Four patients had minor complications with no clinical impact on the final result. All except one patient were able to return to pre-injury type of sports, at a mean time of 14.6 +/- 2.3 months after surgery. Conclusion The anterolateral tibial tunnel technique using an Achilles tendon allograft for revision ACL reconstruction after multiple failures associated with an ALL reconstruction showed good results and no major complications. The anterolateral tunnel can be considered a good alternative in cases of medial tibial confluence or significant enlargement of the medial tunnels in re-revision procedures.",Web of Science,10.1186/s43019-022-00153-3,KNEE SURGERY & RELATED RESEARCH

The risk for injury of the contralateral knee after ACL reconstruction could be nearly double that of ipsilateral graft rupture. Questions/Purposes We sought to identify independent, patient-related risk factors for contralateral ACL rupture following primary ACL reconstruction. Methods A national database was queried for patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction from 2007 to 2015 with a minimum of 2 years of post-operative follow-up (n = 12,044). Patients who underwent subsequent primary ACL reconstruction on the contralateral extremity were then identified. A multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis was utilized to evaluate patient-related risk factors for contralateral ACL rupture, including demographic and comorbidity variables. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each risk factor. Results Of the 3707 patients who had a minimum of 2 years of database activity and comprised the study group, 204 (5.5%) experienced a contralateral ACL rupture requiring reconstruction. Independent risk factors for contralateral ACL rupture included age less than 20 years, female gender, tobacco use, and depression. Obesity, morbid obesity, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and a history of anxiety were not significant predictors of contralateral injury. Conclusion We were able to adequately power an analysis to identify several significant patient-related risk factors for contralateral ACL rupture after primary ACL reconstruction, including younger age, female gender, tobacco use, and depression. This information can be used to counsel patients on the risk of injury to the contralateral knee.",Web of Science,10.1007/s11420-019-09687-x,HSS JOURNAL
525,WS-149,He et al. (2020),2020,Comparative Study of the Reconstruction of Anterior Cruciate Ligament with Peroneal Longus Tendon and Hamstring Tendon Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Objective: To compare the effect of reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) with peroneal longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendon (HT) using magnetic resonance image (MRI). Methods: Fifty-six patients with ACL rupture were treated with ACL reconstruction. Among them, 28 patients were treated with PLT reconstruction (treatment group) and 28 patients were treated with HT reconstruction (control group). There were no significant differences in gender, age, injury side, course of disease, preoperative Lachman test, Lysholm score, IKDC score, joint mobility, MRI image between the two groups (P > 0.05). Result: The incision healed in the first stage after operation in both groups, and there were no significant neurovascular injuries and knee synovitis complications. Comparing the MRI of the two groups after operation, the effect of the treatment group was better than that of the control group. There were no complications in both groups. The Lysholm score and IKDC score of the treatment group were better than those of the control group at 6 and 12 months after operation (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in Lachman test between the two groups at 6 and 12 months after operation (P > 0.05). At 3 and 12 months after operation, the joint activity of the treatment group was better than that of the control group, with no significant difference (P > 0.05). The degree of tibial anterior displacement decreased significantly in both groups before and after operation (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Discussion: MRI scanning technology can significantly expand the scope of human body examination, improve the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of lesions. In traditional surgery, HT is often used as reconstruction material. However, there are many factors to be considered in the formulation of operation plan for double cruciate ligament injury, such as limb blood supply, accompanied by a variety of structural injuries, so the requirement for reconstruction is high. There was no significant difference in the recovery of knee stability between the two groups, but in terms of early recovery of knee function and subjective satisfaction of patients, the reconstruction of PLT was superior to that of HT. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging can effectively diagnose the curative effect, and it is worth popularizing and applying widely. Compared with HT, ACL reconstruction with PLT is easier to operate, and the early recovery of knee joint function and it is worth popularizing and applying widely.",Web of Science,10.1166/jmihi.2020.3017,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS
526,WS-150,Szwedowski et al. (2021),2021,The Comparison of Clinical Result between Primary Repair of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with Additional Internal Bracing and Anatomic Single Bundle Reconstruction-A Retrospective Study,"Background: The current standard of treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is reconstruction (ACLR). This technique has some disadvantages: poor proprioception, donor site morbidity and the inability to restore joint kinematics. ACL repair could be an alternative treatment. The purpose of the study was to compare the stability and the function after ACL primary repair versus single-bundle ACLR. Methods: In a retrospective study, 12 patients underwent primary ACL repair with internal bracing, 15 patients underwent standard ACLR. Follow-up examinations were evaluated at up to 2 years postoperatively. One patient in the ACL repair group was lost to follow-up due to re-rupture. The absolute value of anterior tibial translation (ATT) and the side-to-side difference in the same patient (Delta ATT) were evaluated using the GNRB arthrometer. The Lysholm knee scoring was obtained. Re-ruptures and other complications were recorded. Results: Anterior tibial translation (ATT) was significantly decreased in the ACL repair group compared with the ACLR group (5.31 mm vs. 7.18 mm, respectively; p = 0.0137). Arthrometric measurements demonstrated a mean side-to-side difference (Delta ATT) 1.87 (range 0.2 to 4.9) mm significantly decreased compared to ACLR 3.36 (range 1.2-5.6 mm; p = 0.0107). The mean Lysholm score was 85.3 points in the ACL repair group and 89.9 in ACLR group. No significant differences between ACL repair and ACLR were found for the Lysholm score. There was no association between AP laxity and clinical outcomes. There were two complications in the internal bracing group: one patient had re-rupture and was treated by ACLR, another had limited extension and had arthroscopic debridement. Conclusions: Anterior tibial translation was significantly decreased after ACL repair. Additionally, the functional results after ACL repair with internal bracing were comparable with those after ACLR. It should be noted that the two complications occurred. The current study supports further development of ACL repair techniques.",Web of Science,10.3390/jcm10173948,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
527,WS-151,Devitt et al. (2021),2021,"Association Between Radiological Evidence of Kaplan Fiber Injury, Intraoperative Findings, and Pivot-Shift Grade in the Setting of Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury","Background: Biomechanical studies have suggested that the Kaplan fibers (KFs) of the iliotibial band play a role in controlling anterolateral rotation of the knee. There is a paucity of clinical information on whether injury to the KF in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture contributes to increased rotatory laxity of the knee. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to evaluate the association among radiological evidence of KF injury, intraoperative arthroscopic findings, and grade of pivot shift at the time of ACL reconstruction (ACLR). It was hypothesized that KF injury would be associated with increased injury to the lateral compartment of the knee and a higher grade of pivot shift. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis was conducted on 267 patients with ACL-injured knees who underwent primary ACLR. Patients who had MRI and surgery within 60 days of injury were included (mean age, 23.6 years); there were 158 (59.2%) male patients. MRI was performed using standard knee protocols, and diagnostic criteria were applied to identify KF injury. Associations were made among MRI findings, intraoperative findings, and grade of pivot shift with the patient examined under anesthesia at the time of ACLR. A comparison was made between patients with and without radiological evidence of KF injury. Results: The prevalence of KF injury was 17.6% (47/267 patients). Arthroscopic evidence of lateral meniscal injury was associated with KF injury (KF intact, 31%; KF injured, 55%; P = .010). The majority of patients in the intact and injured KF groups had a grade 2 pivot shift (75% and 70%, respectively). A minority had grade 3 pivot shift: 5% in the intact group versus 6.4% in the injured group. There was no association between radiological evidence of KF injury and pivot-shift grade (P = .600). Conclusion: In acute ACL injury, KF injuries were not very common (17.6%), and the rate of grade 3 pivot shift was low (5.2%). When present, KF injuries were not associated with a higher-grade pivot shift. However, there was an association between KF injury and lateral meniscal tears identified at the time of ACLR. The role of KFS in controlling anterolateral rotatory laxity in the acute ACL injury in the clinical setting may be less evident when compared with the biomechanical setting.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546521994467,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

(2016),2016,Tunnel collision during simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner reconstruction,"To verify the safest angle to drill femoral tunnels in simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstructions to minimize the risk of tunnel collision and to examine the relationship between lateral femoral condyle (LFC) width and tunnel collision occurrence. Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20A degrees axial/20A degrees coronal angulations and 10A degrees axial/30A degrees coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10A degrees axial/30A degrees coronal angulation (P < 0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20A degrees axial/20A degrees coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (P < 0.05). Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20A degrees axial/20A degrees coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00167-014-3363-0,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
530,WS-154,Korthaus et al. (2022),2022,Lateral femoral notch sign and posterolateral tibial plateau fractures and their associated injuries in the setting of an anterior cruciate ligament rupture,"Introduction ACL injury is one of the most common injuries of the knee joint in sports. As accompanying osseous injuries of the ACL rupture a femoral impression the so-called lateral femoral notch sign and a posterolateral fracture of the tibial plateau are described. However, frequency, concomitant ligament injuries and when and how to treat these combined injuries are not clear. There is still a lack of understanding with which ligamentous concomitant injuries besides the anterior cruciate ligament injury these bony injuries are associated. Materials and methods One hundred fifteen MRI scans with proven anterior cruciate ligament rupture performed at our center were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of a meniscus, collateral ligament injury, a femoral impression, or a posterolateral impression fracture. Femoral impressions were described according to their local appearance and posterolateral tibial plateau fractures were described using the classification of Menzdorf et al. Results In 29 cases a significant impression in the lateral femoral condyle was detected. There was a significantly increased number of lateral meniscal (41.4% vs. 18.6% p = 0.023) and medial ligament (41.4% vs. 22.1%; p = 0.040) injuries in the group with a lateral femoral notch sign. 104 patients showed a posterolateral bone bruise or fracture of the tibial plateau. Seven of these required an intervention according to Menzdorf et al. In the group of anterior cruciate ligament injuries with posterolateral tibial plateau fracture significantly more lateral meniscus injuries were seen (p = 0.039). Conclusion In the preoperative planning of ACL rupture accompanied with a positive femoral notch sign, attention should be paid to possible medial collateral ligament and lateral meniscus injuries. As these are more likely to occur together. A posterolateral impression fracture of the tibial plateau is associated with an increased likelihood of the presence of a lateral meniscal injury. This must be considered in surgical therapy and planning and may be the indication for necessary early surgical treatment.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00402-021-04105-6,ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY
531,WS-155,Blanke et al. (2021),2021,Does the anterolateral ligament protect the anterior cruciate ligament in the most common injury mechanisms? A human knee model study,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction still has a risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Thus, extra-articular structures such as the anterolateral ligament (ALL) are increasingly treated. The ALL however prevents the internal rotation of the tibia and it must be doubted that the ALL protects the ACL in other common injury mechanisms which primarily include tibial external rotation. In this study we aimed to evaluate which extra-articular structures support the ACL in excessive tibial internal and external rotation using a knee finite element (FE) model. Methods: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to an FE model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Three additional anatomic structures (anterolateral ligament, popliteal tendon and posterior oblique ligament) were added to the FE model separately and then all together. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. Results: The ACL was the most loaded ligament both in tibial internal and external rotation. The ALL was the main stabilizer of the tibial internal rotation (46%) and prevented the tibial external rotation by only 3%. High forces were only observed in the LCL with tibial external rotation. The ALL reduced the load on the ACL in tibial internal rotation by 21%, in tibial external rotation only by 2%. The POL reduced the load on the ACL by 8%, the PLT by 6% in tibial internal rotation. In tibial external rotation the POL and PLT did not reduce the load on the ACL by more than 1%. Conclusion: The ALL protects the ACL in injury mechanisms with tibial internal rotation but not in mechanisms with tibial external rotation. In injury mechanisms with tibial external rotation other structures that support the ACL need to be considered. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

(2020),2020,Anterior cruciate ligament injury in adults Diagnostics and treatment,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) together with the posterior cruciate ligament is the central stabilizer of the knee. It stabilizes the tibia against increased anterior translation and internal rotation. With an incidence of 46/100,000 ACL tears are among the most common sports injuries in Germany. New prevention programs can reduce the risk of ACL injuries. Surgical treatment is recommended for young and athletic patients as it can also reduce the risk of further relevant injuries of the meniscus and cartilage. The standard of surgical treatment in Germany is the ACL reconstruction with an autologous tendon graft. In selected cases, the preservation of the ACL by arthroscopic refixation shows good results.

533,WS-157,Lian et al. (2020),2020,Rotatory Knee Laxity Exists on a Continuum in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury,"Background: The purpose of this investigation was to compare the magnitude of rotatory knee laxity in patients with a partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, those with a complete ACL tear, and those who had undergone a failed ACL reconstruction. It was hypothesized that rotatory knee laxity would increase with increasing injury grade, with knees with partial ACL tears demonstrating the lowest rotatory laxity and knees that had undergone failed ACL reconstruction demonstrating the highest rotatory laxity. Methods: A prospective multicenter study cohort of 354 patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction between 2012 and 2018 was examined. All patients had both injured and contralateral healthy knees evaluated using standardized, preoperative quantitative pivot shift testing, determined by a validated, image-based tablet software application and a surface-mounted accelerometer. Quantitative pivot shift was compared with the contralateral healthy knee in 20 patients with partial ACL tears, 257 patients with complete ACL tears, and 27 patients who had undergone a failed ACL reconstruction. Comparisons were made using 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc 2-sample t tests with Bonferroni correction. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: There were stepwise increases in side-to-side differences in quantitative pivot shift in terms of lateral knee compartment translation for patients with partial ACL tears (mean [and standard deviation], 1.4 +/- 1.5 mm), those with complete ACL tears (2.5 +/- 2.1 mm), and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (3.3 +/- 1.9 mm) (p = 0.01) and increases in terms of lateral compartment acceleration for patients with partial ACL tears (0.7 +/- 1.4 m/s(2)), those with complete ACL tears (2.3 +/- 3.1 m/s(2)), and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (2.4 +/- 5.5 m/s(2)) (p = 0.01). A significant difference in lateral knee compartment translation was found when comparing patients with partial ACL tears and those with complete ACL tears (1.2 +/- 2.1 mm [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2 to 2.1 mm]; p = 0.02) and patients with partial ACL tears and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (1.9 +/- 1.7 mm [95% CI, 0.8 to 2.9 mm]; p = 0.001), but not when comparing patients with complete ACL tears and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (0.8 +/- 2.1 [95% CI, -0.1 to 1.6 mm]; p = 0.09). Increased lateral compartment acceleration was found when comparing patients with partial ACL tears and those with complete ACL tears (1.5 +/- 3.0 m/s(2) [95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3 m/s(2)]; p = 0.0002), but not when comparing patients with complete ACL tears and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (0.1 +/- 3.4 m/s(2) [95% CI, -2.2 to 2.4 m/s(2)]; p = 0.93) or patients with partial ACL tears and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (1.7 +/- 4.2 m/s(2) [95% CI, -0.7 to 4.0 m/s(2)]; p = 0.16). An increasing lateral compartment translation of the contralateral, ACL-healthy knee was found in patients with partial ACL tears (0.8 mm), those with complete ACL tears (1.2 mm), and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (1.7 mm) (p < 0.05). Conclusions: A progressive increase in rotatory knee laxity, defined by side-to-side differences in quantitative pivot shift, was observed in patients with partial ACL tears, those with complete ACL tears, and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction. These results may be helpful when assessing outcomes and considering indications for the management of high-grade rotatory knee laxity.",Web of Science,10.2106/JBJS.19.00502,JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
534,WS-158,Achtnich et al. (2016),2016,Acute Proximal Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears: Outcomes After Arthroscopic Suture Anchor Repair Versus Anatomic Single-Bundle Reconstruction,"Purpose: To compare clinical and radiologic results of primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) suture anchor repair and microfracturing with anatomic ACL single-bundle reconstruction in patients with acute proximal ACL avulsion tears. Methods: Between January 2010 and December 2013, 420 patients underwent ACL treatment. Forty-one patients were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: unilateral acute proximal ACL rupture, concomitant meniscus lesions, no previous knee ligament surgery, and no additional ligament injuries or absence of ligament injury of the contralateral knee. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirming a proximal avulsion tear of the ACL was required. Patients had to undergo surgical treatment within 6 weeks after injury. Follow-up examination included Lachman and pivot-shift testing, KT-1000 measurement, and the International Knee Documentation Committee score. Results: At a mean follow-up of 28 months (range, 24 to 31 month), 20 patients in each group were available. A mean KT-1000 arthrometer result of less than 3 mm indicated stability in all patients (P = .269). Three patients had a 1+ Lachman test (P = .072) and 4 patients had a 1+ pivot-shift test in the ACL repair group (P = .342). The International Knee Documentation Committee score results did not differ significantly (P > .99), but there was a significant correlation between poor results and failure rate (P = .001) in the refixation group. The failure rate was 15% in the ACL refixation group and 0% in the reconstruction group (P = .231). Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogeneous signal and proper ACL position in 100% of patients in the control group and 86% in the ACL repair group. Conclusions: Proximal refixation of the ACL using knotless suture anchors and microfracturing restores knee stability and results in comparable functional outcomes to a control group treated with single-bundle ACL reconstruction. The results suggest that refixation of the ACL is a feasible treatment option in selected patients.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.arthro.2016.04.031,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY

Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose was to evaluate the subjective and objective outcomes of combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee. The hypothesis was that favorable outcomes can be achieved with this surgical procedure compared with isolated anatomic reconstruction of the ACL. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: One hundred ten patients with a unilateral ACL injury and high-grade pivot shift were randomly assigned to undergo either combined ACL and ALL reconstruction (group A) or isolated ACL reconstruction (group B). Preoperative and postoperative evaluations of the patients were conducted by obtaining history details, recording physical examination findings, measuring knee laxity using the KT-1000 arthrometer, and using validated outcome scores for the knee. P < .05 was considered as the cut-off level of statistical significance. The Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess statistical significance. Results: At a mean follow-up of 27 months, 53 and 50 patients in groups A and B, respectively, were available for analysis. No statistically different outcomes were found between the 2 groups except for the KT-1000 arthrometer values. The median KT-1000 arthrometer result for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction was 1.3 mm, while the median result for isolated ACL reconstruction was 1.8 mm (P < .001). None of the patients (n = 0; 0.0%) who underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction had anterior translation of greater than 5 mm at maximum pulling strength compared with their normal knees at final follow-up. On the other hand, 3 (6.0%) patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstruction had anterior translation of more than 5 mm. No serious complications were found in both groups. Conclusion: Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction was found to be effective in improving subjective and objective outcomes. Nevertheless, these findings were not significantly superior to isolated ACL reconstruction except for the instrumented knee laxity testing results. This might indicate that ALL reconstruction should not be performed routinely for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546517691517,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

Results of a combined ACL and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction technique have never been reported. Purpose: To report subjective and objective outcomes after combined ACL and minimally invasive ALL reconstruction with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 92 patients underwent a combined ACL and ALL reconstruction. Indications for a combined procedure were associated Segond fracture, chronic ACL lesion, grade 3 pivot shift, high level of sporting activity, pivoting sports, and radiographic lateral femoral notch sign. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively with objective and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. Instrumented knee testing was performed with the Rolimeter arthrometer. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was obtained at the last follow-up. Complications including graft failure or contralateral ACL rupture were also recorded. Results: The mean follow-up time was 32.4 3.9 months. One patient (1.1%) was lost to follow-up, 1 patient (1.1%) suffered an ACL graft rupture, and 7 patients (7.6%) had a contralateral ACL rupture, leaving 83 patients for final evaluation. At the last follow-up, all patients had full range of motion. The Lysholm, subjective IKDC, and objective IKDC scores were significantly improved (all P < .0001). The Tegner activity scale at the last follow-up (7.1 +/- 1.8) was slightly lower than before surgery (7.3 +/- 1.7) (P < .01). The mean differential anterior laxity was 8 +/- 1.9 mm before surgery and significantly decreased to 0.7 +/- 0.8 mm at the last follow-up (P < .0001). Preoperatively, 41 patients had a grade 1 pivot shift, 23 had a grade 2, and 19 had a grade 3 according to the IKDC criteria. Postoperatively, 76 patients had a negative pivot shift (grade 0), and 7 patients were grade 1 (P < .0001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a combined reconstruction can be an effective procedure without specific complications at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Longer term and comparative follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether these combined reconstructions improve the results of ACL treatment.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546515571571,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

Twelve porcine knees were used in this study. Five fixation sequences were performed (angle indicating knee flexion): (a) PCL at 30A degrees and ACL at 30A degrees, (b) PCL at 90A degrees and ACL at 30A degrees, (c) ACL at 30A degrees and PCL at 30A degrees, (d) ACL at 30A degrees and PCL at 90A degrees, and (e) ACL and PCL simultaneous fixation at 30A degrees. Anterior and posterior tibial translation was measured under an 89 N load. A 3-D digitizer was used to measure the change in anteroposterior (AP) tibiofemoral position. None of the graft fixation sequences restored the AP laxity of the intact knee, and there are minimal differences in the in situ tissue forces in the ACL and PCL grafts. The reconstructions with fixation of the PCL graft first resulted in a significantly larger change in AP tibiofemoral position from the intact knee at 60A degrees and 90A degrees of knee flexion than the reconstructions with fixation of the ACL graft first (p < 0.05). Fixation of the ACL graft at 30A degrees of knee flexion followed by fixation of the PCL graft can best restore the tibiofemoral position of the intact knee. This study has clinical relevance in regard to the effect of graft fixation sequence on the position of the tibia relative to the femur in one-stage ACL and PCL reconstruction.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00167-017-4615-6,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
540,WS-164,Zein et al. (2017),2017,Combined Anatomic Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Double Bundle Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction,"The results of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are so far satisfactory and improving over time as a result of the improved understanding of the anatomy and biomechanics of the ACL. Rotational instability confirmed by a positive pivot shift is present in more than 15% of cases who underwent successful ACL reconstruction. Persistent rotational instability interferes with performing pivoting sports, and also may lead to meniscal and chondral injuries, or re-rupture of the reconstructed ACL. Surgeons reconsidered the anatomy and biomechanics of the ACL and introduced the double bundle ACL reconstruction technique aiming to achieve a more rotational control by reconstructing the anteromedial and anterolateral bundles of the ACL. To date, the results of double bundle ACL reconstruction are mixed and inconsistent. The improved understanding of the existence, function, and biomechanical role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) in controlling the rotational instability of the knee has redirected and refocused attention on a supplemental extra-articular reconstruction of the ALL in conjunction with the intra-articular ACL reconstruction so as to restore normal kinematics of the knee. In this Technical Note, we describe a technique that allows for a combined ACL and double bundle ALL reconstruction using autogenous hamstring graft (semitendinosus and gracilis) tendons. This technique is an extension of our previously described technique of a combined anatomic ACL and single bundle ALL reconstruction. The improved understanding of the anatomy of the ALL makes a double bundle ALL reconstruction more anatomic than single bundle ALL reconstruction, as the native ALL is triangular or inverted Y in shape, with a narrow proximal femoral attachment and a broad distal tibial attachment between Gerdy's tubercle and the head of the fibula.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.eats.2017.04.009,ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES

To date many questions regarding the outcome as well as ACL reconstruction techniques have not yet been conclusively clarified. Whether reconstruction of the ACL protects the knee from osteoarthritis is still unproven; however, it is well known that an unstable knee joint is more vulnerable to secondary injuries, such as meniscal tears. Thus, early ACL reconstruction is recommended to minimize the risk of these secondary injuries. Three alternative sources of material for autologous ACL reconstruction are commonly utilized. An accessory hamstring (i.e. semitendinosus tendon with or without the gracilis tendon), a central strip of the patellar tendon with bone blocks and a central strip of the quadriceps tendon with or without bone block are the most common donor tissues used in autografts. Besides selection of the type of graft, the tendon diameter also plays a crucial role. Some progress has recently been made with respect to tunnel placement. The aim is to find an anatomical tunnel position. Reconstruction of both the anteromedial and the posterolateral ACL bundles helps to rebuild the anatomy of the original ACL; however, scientifically this approach did not lead to any improvement in the results. For fixation techniques a differentiation is made between aperture, extracortical and implant-free fixation. Generally, reruptures are less common than revisions as a result of graft ruptures due to technical mistakes during surgery. The most common mistakes concern tunnel placement and graft fixation. Also overlooked instability can have a negative influence on the outcome of ACL reconstruction.",Web of Science,10.1007/s10039-015-0099-0,TRAUMA UND BERUFSKRANKHEIT
542,WS-166,Bali et al. (2015),2015,Outcomes of the patellar tendon and hamstring graft anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions in patients aged above 50 years,"Background: The treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury consists of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon or hamstring graft. Satisfactory results have been reported so far in the younger age group. Dilemma arises regarding the suitability of ACL reconstruction in the patients aged 50 years and above. This retrospective analyses the outcome of ACL reconstruction in patients aged 50 years and above at the time of presentation. Materials and Methods: 55 patients aged 50 years and above presented to our institution with symptomatic ACL tear and were managed with arthroscopic reconstruction with patellar tendon/hamstring graft. 22 patients underwent ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and the remaining 33 with a hamstring graft. Evaluation of functional outcome was performed using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scoring in the preoperative period, at the end of 1 year and at the final followup. Radiographic evaluation was performed using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system. Results: The mean preoperative IKDC score was 39.7 +/- 3.3. At the end of 1-year following the operation, the mean IKDC score was 73.6 +/- 4.9 and at the final followup was 67.8 +/- 7.7. The mean preoperative Lysholm score was 40.4 +/- 10.3. At the end of 1-year following the intervention, the mean Lysholm score was 89.7 +/- 2.1 and at final followup was 85.3 +/- 2.5. Overall, 14 out of 42 patients who underwent radiographic assessment showed progression of osteoarthritis changes at the final followup after the intervention. Conclusion: In our study, there was a statistically significant improvement in the IKDC and Lysholm scores following the intervention. There was a slight deterioration in the scores at the final followup but the overall rate of satisfaction was still high and most of the patients were able to do their routine chores and light exercises suitable for their age group. Around one-third of patients show progression of radiographic changes in the postoperative period and this requires long term evaluation.",Web of Science,10.4103/0019-5413.168760,INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS

(2013),2013,Biomechanical Comparison of Anatomic Single- and Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructions An In Vitro Study,"Background: Arthroscopic identification of the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundle locations of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has facilitated an improved quantitative description of ACL anatomy. Few studies have directly compared the biomechanical laxity of anatomic single-bundle (SB) versus anatomic double-bundle (DB) ACL reconstruction techniques based on precise anatomic descriptions. Hypothesis: Anatomic tunnel positioning for SB and DB reconstructions would produce comparable anterior-posterior and rotatory knee laxity. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Nine matched pairs of cadaveric knees were evaluated for the kinematics of intact, ACL-deficient, and either anatomic SB or anatomic DB ACL-reconstructed knees. Reconstruction tunnels were placed either centrally in the ACL footprint or within the AM and PL footprints. A 6 degrees of freedom robotic system was used to assess knee laxity with an 88-N anterior tibial load and a simulated pivot-shift test of combined 10-N.m valgus and 5-N.m internal tibial torques. Rotational motion was measured with internal and external torques of 5 N.m along with varus and valgus torques of 10 N.m. One-sample and 2-sample independent t tests were used to compare between groups (P < . 05). Results: No significant differences were found between anatomic SB and DB reconstruction groups during anterior tibial loading. Anterior tibial translations during simulated pivot shift had no significant differences between anatomic reconstruction groups. Tibial rotation for internal/external and varus/valgus torques showed no significant differences between anatomic reconstructions, with the exception of small (<3 degrees) but statistically significant differences in internal rotation at 20 degrees and 30 degrees of flexion. Despite the similar behavior between the 2 anatomic reconstruction groups, neither technique was able to reproduce the intact state during an anterior tibial load. Conclusion: No significant differences in anterior translation were found between the anatomic SB and anatomic DB ACL reconstructions for simulated pivot shift or anterior tibial loading.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546513487065,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
544,WS-168,Adi et al. (2025),2025,"Management of a complex multiligament knee injury: Simultaneous reconstruction of ACL, PCL, and both meniscal roots","Introduction: Multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs) can lead to severe complications like early osteoarthritis and functional loss. Meniscal root tears further increase these risks. This study reports the first documented case of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and dual meniscal root injuries, emphasizing the unique surgical and rehabilitative challenges involved. Presentation of case: A 19-year-old male presented with persistent knee pain and instability seven months after a traumatic injury from a major fall. Examination revealed a range of motion of 0-120 degrees, no swelling or tenderness, but a positive recurvatum over 10 degrees, indicating significant instability. Lachman's, McMurray's, pivot shift, and both anterior and posterior drawer tests were positive. Discussion: The radiography of the right knee revealed no fractures. The MRI confirmed injuries to the ACL, PCL, and the posterior roots of both the lateral and medial menisci. The patient received surgical intervention. Grafts were obtained: the peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and a hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The ACL and PCL reconstructions were subsequently performed utilizing an all-inside technique, and both posterior roots of the lateral and medial menisci were repaired. Postoperative care included knee immobilization and a progressive rehabilitation program. Conclusion: Effective management of multiple ligament knee injuries necessitates a comprehensive approach, including precise identification and treatment of all torn ligaments, accurate graft placement, and robust fixation. Simultaneous reconstruction reduces hospital stays, anaesthesia exposure, and surgical risks while streamlining rehabilitation, enabling quicker patient recovery and improved outcomes.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111150,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
545,WS-169,Petersen et al. (2013),2013,Anatomic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in single bundle technique,"Restore the knee stability by ACL reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Acute and chronic functional instability with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament giving way phenomena, acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament with concomitant meniscus repair. Local infection in the knee joint, local soft tissue damage, lack of cooperation of the patient. The operation begins with the examination under anesthesia. It follows an arthroscopic examination of the knee and the arthroscopic treatment of accompanying intra-articular lesions (meniscus and cartilage damage). The semitendinosus tendon is harvested via a 3 cm skin incision medial to the tibial tuberosity. A four stranded tendon graft is prepared with a minimum length of 6.5 cm. Alternetive grafts for this technique are the patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, and allografts. The femoral tunnel for the ACL graft is drilled via a deep anteromedial portal under arthroscopic control. For precise placement of the guide wire a specific offset aimer is used. For drilling the knee must be flexed more than 110A degrees. Landmarks are the intercondylar line and the cartilage-bone interface. The position of the guide wire is always controlled by the medial portal (medial portal view). The guide wire is overdrilled with a cannulated drill (4.5 mm when a flip tack is used). The drill diameter for the 30 mm long blind tunnel is choosen according to the graft diameter. A gentle tunnel preparation may be achieved with the use of dilators. At the tibia, the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus is used as a landmark in the absence of ACL stump. The guide wire is first overdrilled with a 6 mm drill. Slight adjustments to the tibial tunnel location can be archieved when the guide wire is overdrilled eccentrically with a larger drill. At the femur an extrakortikal fixation technique with a flip button is preferred. At the tibia, a hybrid fixation with absorbable interference screw and button is used. The rehabilitation program is divided into three phases. During the inflammatory phase (1st-2nd week) control of pain and swelling is recommended. The patient is lmobilized with 20 kg partial weigth bearing. During the proliferative phase (3nd-6th week), load and mobility are slowly increased. Goal of this phase is it full extension. Exercises should be performed in a closed chain. During the remodeling phase strength and coordination exercises can be started. Athletes should not return to competitive sports before the 6th to 8th month. In a prospective study, we have examined 21 patients treated with an anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in single-bundle technique, after two years. As graft the semitendinosus was used. The postoperative MRI diagnosis showed that all tunnels were positioned anatomically. KT 1000 measurement showed that the difference of anterior translation decreased from an average of 6.4-1.7 mm. A sliding pivot shift phenomenon was detected in only one patient. The postoperative Lysholmscore was 94.2 points.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00064-012-0227-y,OPERATIVE ORTHOPADIE UND TRAUMATOLOGIE

(2012),2012,Individualized Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery A Prospective Study Comparing Anatomic Single- and Double-Bundle Reconstruction,"Background: Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has become a commonly performed procedure. However, biomechanical studies have demonstrated that conventional single-bundle ACL reconstruction techniques are only successful in limiting anterior tibial translation but less effective for restoring rotatory laxity. Purpose: This study aimed to compare the results of single-and double-bundle ACL reconstruction using an anatomic technique, individualized based on the patient's native ACL size. The authors hypothesized that there would be no difference between the results of anatomic single-bundle (ASB) and anatomic double-bundle (ADB) reconstruction when the surgical technique is individualized. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Depending on intraoperative measurements of the ACL insertion site size, patients were selected for either ASB (n = 32) or ADB (n = 69) ACL reconstruction. In all groups, hamstring tendons autograft was used with suspensory fixation on the femoral side and bioabsorbable interference screw fixation on the tibial side. The outcomes were evaluated by an independent blinded observer using the Lysholm score, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, KT-1000 arthrometer for anteroposterior stability, and pivot-shift test for rotational stability. The average follow-up was 30 months (range, 26-34 months). There were no statistically significant differences in the baseline demographics of the 2 groups. Results: There was no significant difference between the ADB and ASB groups for Lysholm score (93.9 vs 93.5), subjective IKDC score (93.3 vs 93.1), anterior tibial translation (1.5- vs 1.6-mm side-to-side difference), and pivot shift (92% vs 90% with negative pivot-shift examination). Conclusion: Anatomic double-bundle reconstruction is not superior to anatomic single-bundle reconstruction when an individualized ACL reconstruction technique is used.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546512446928,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

These failed ACL surgeries are often the result of technical errors in the primary surgery. Current literature reports inferior functional and objective results of revision ACL surgery in comparison with primary surgery. This is often the result of unrecognized injury to the secondary stabilizers of the knee. The anatomic double-bundle ACL surgery has been shown to more accurately recreate the kinematics of the native knee in comparison with classic transtibial single-bundle ACL reconstructions. We believe that the use of the principals and techniques of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction in the revision situation may be advantageous for many reasons.

549,WS-173,Petersen et al. (2009),2009,Ligament injuries of the knee joint. Part I. The anterior cruciate ligament,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of 2 functional bundles taut in differing joint positions. It stabilizes against the anterior tibial translation in a neutral position and in internal rotation (pivot-shift phenomenon). Symptomatic anterior instability impairs knee function and can lead to arthrosis, the onset of which can be slowed down by ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon graft. With regard to postoperative onset of arthrosis, the extent of initial accompanying injuries is also relevant. Anatomic techniques should be used for surgical procedures. The patellar and semitendinous tendons are suited to autologous hamstring grafts. With the latter, both ACL bundles can be replaced sep-arately (double-bundle technique), which has been shown in biomechanical tests and clinical studies to provide better stability compared with the single-bundle technique. No difference has been seen as yet in clinical scores: long-term results are not available. In the case of revision, accurate preoperative diagnosis of the cause is necessary. Depending on tunnel position and width, the decision must be made as to whether a uni-or bilateral procedure is advisable.",Web of Science,10.1007/s10039-009-1513-2,TRAUMA UND BERUFSKRANKHEIT

Proper surgical and rehabilitation must be undertaken to ensure that the overall results of both the initial ACL reconstruction and subsequent tendon rupture are satisfactory. If properly managed, postoperative patellar tendon rupture can be treated and the overall outcome of the ACL surgery is not affected. In our experience of 5,000 ACL reconstructions, a total of 11 patellar tendon ruptures have occurred with 6 occurring after an ipsilateral ACL reconstruction and 5 occurring after a contralateral ACL reconstruction. All patellar tendons were repaired using suture anchors and augmented with a Dail-Miles cable. Follow-up at an average of 3.1 years postoperatively shows that patients regained full knee hyperextension with 141 degrees of flexion on the involved side with average of 143 degrees on the uninvolved knee. Average return of strength was 94% measured with isokinetic testing. Single leg hop scores averaged 96% compared with opposite noninvolved knee.

As double-bundle ACL reconstructions are being suggested to recreate a more normal anatomy, the roles of each bundle are being more critically questioned. We present a case that describes the appearance of a normal ACL in a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)-deficient knee in which the PLB of the ACL is prominent, giving the appearance of a complete tear of the AMB of the ACL, and scarring of this bundle to the PCL stump. On further inspection, and when the tibia was reduced, the normal appearance of the ACL returned, with visualization of the AMB obscuring the PLB. We have named this arthroscopic finding the PLB sign. This finding confirms the individual roles of each bundle of the ACL. It is important to not misinterpret this abnormal appearance of the ACL as a partial ACL tear in a PCL-deficient knee.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.arthro.2005.07.009,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
552,WS-176,Saithna et al. (2018),2018,COMBINED ACL AND ANTEROLATERAL LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION,"Background: Clinical results of combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction have demonstrated a significant reduction in ACL graft rupture rates and improved rates of return to sports compared with isolated ACL reconstruction(1). This finding is supported by laboratory studies that have demonstrated that combined ACL reconstruction and lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedures protect the ACL graft by load-sharing with it and by more reliably restoring normal knee kinematics compared with isolated ACL reconstruction. Description: The ACL graft is formed from a tripled semitendinosus tendon and a single strand of gracilis tendon. The femoral tunnel is drilled to provide an anatomic location intra-articularly and to exit the femur just posterior and proximal to the lateral epicondyle. The additional length of gracilis therefore exits the femoral tunnel at the anatomic origin of the ALL and is then routed (under the iliotibial band [ITB]) through a tibial tunnel, and back to the femoral origin, to reconstruct the ALL. Alternatives: Many different types of nonanatomic lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedures have been reported. The most frequently performed were the Lemaire and MacIntosh procedures; however, these, and others, were widely abandoned after poor results were reported in the 1980s. Rationale: ALL reconstruction differs from other lateral extra-articular tenodesis-type procedures because the procedure is anatomically based and can be percutaneously performed. Nonanatomic procedures (typically with a strand of ITB passed under the lateral collateral ligament [LCL]) have been reported to be associated with overconstraint, early arthritis, and an increased risk of infection(2-5). In contrast, ALL reconstruction has been shown to restore normal knee kinematics and to avoid overconstraint when correctly fixed in full extension and neutral rotation(6). The main concern with any type of lateral extra-articular tenodesis is based on historical reports of poor outcomes(2,3). However, a recent study has demonstrated that combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is associated with a reoperation rate that is comparable with the rate seen after isolated ACL reconstruction, and it has a very low rate of complications(7). This makes a compelling argument for anatomic ALL and ACL reconstruction being the procedure of choice when considering an extra-articular procedure. This is further supported by the fact that, even though previous studies have demonstrated a trend toward reduced ACL graft rupture with nonanatomic lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedures, they have not shown a significant improvement in outcomes(8). Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is currently the only type of lateral extra-articular procedure that has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of ACL graft rupture and improve the rate of return to sports(1).",Web of Science,10.2106/JBJS.ST.17.00045,JBJS ESSENTIAL SURGICAL TECHNIQUES
553,WS-177,Xu et al. (2026),2026,Platelet-derived exosomes delivering miR-25-3p inhibit ferroptosis by targeting P53 to attenuate osteoarthritis,"Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) ranks among the most prevalent degenerative joint disorders globally. However, current therapies primarily focus on symptom management, and their ability to effectively decelerate disease progression remains limited. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) in attenuating chondrocyte ferroptosis to delay OA progression. Methods: Plt-exos were isolated from human apheresis platelets and then characterized. The protective effects of Plt-exos on chondrocytes against IL-1 beta-induced ferroptosis were assessed through the detection of intracellular ferroptosis hallmarks and the expression levels of genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism and ferroptosis regulation in SW1353 cells. Key miRNAs in Plt-exos were identified, with miR-25-3p's role in chondrocyte ferroptosis and its interaction with P53 further investigated. Finally, the effect of Plt-exos-derived miR-25-3p on OA was validated in anterior cruciate ligament transection mice. Results: Plt-exos significantly reduced reactive oxygen species, Fe2+ and malonaldehyde levels, and down-regulated ferroptosis drivers (P53, ALOX12), while enhancing glutathione and ferroptosis suppressors (SLC7A11, GPX4). Moreover, Plt-exos maintained ECM homeostasis by restoring COL2 and MMP13 expression. Notably, miR-25-3p was identified as a crucial mediator of these protective effects, as its inhibition reversed the benefits conferred by Plt-exos on ferroptosis. Furthermore, miR-25-3p directly targets the 3' UTR of P53, thereby suppressing its expression. In vivo studies revealed that Plt-exos administration improved cartilage preservation and subchondral bone remodeling in OA mice, with these effects being attenuated upon co-administration of anta-gomir-25-3p. Conclusion: Plt-exos effectively delay OA progression in vitro and in vivo though attenuating chondrocyte ferroptosis by targeting the miR-25-3p/P53 axis. Plt-exos may serve as innovative nanotherapeutics for OA management, offering significant prospects for clinical application.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.cej.2025.171504,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL

Recently, the role of the anterolat-eral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concur-rent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstruct-ed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values. QT and PLT grafts are valuable alternatives for currently used grafts in combined ACL and ALL reconstructive procedures. This new technique is a reasonable option in ACL revision surgery and a good alternative in primary ACL and ALL reconstruction, especially when hamstring grafts are not advised or they are missing.",Web of Science,10.20471/acc.2023.62.s3.6,ACTA CLINICA CROATICA

The purpose was to clarify ALL's effect on rotatory and anterior-posterior stability in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-insufficient and reconstructed knees and the effect of reconstruction of an insufficient ALL. Eighteen cadaveric knees were included. Stability was tested for intact (+ALL), detached (-ALL) and reconstructed (+reALL) ALL, with ACL removed (-ACL) and reconstructed (+ACL) in six combinations. All were tested in 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees C flexion. Anterior-posterior stability was measured with a rolimeter. Rotation with a torque of 8.85Nm was measured photographically. The ALL was well defined in 78% of knees. ACL reconstruction had a significant effect on anterior-posterior stability. Detaching the ALL had a significant effect on internal rotatory stability and on anterior-posterior stability in ACL-insufficient knees. Reconstruction of ACL and ALL reestablished knee stability. The appearance of the ALL was not uniform. The ALL was an internal rotational stabilizer. Anatomical ALL reconstruction in combination with ACL reconstruction could reestablish stability. ALL reconstruction might be considered in patients with combined ACL and ALL tears, but the clinical effect should be established in a controlled clinical study.",Web of Science,10.1111/sms.12524,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS

(2023),2023,Platelet-Derived Exosomes Alleviate Knee Osteoarthritis by Attenuating Cartilage Degeneration and Subchondral Bone Loss,"Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic degenerative joint disease among the aged population. However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. Purpose: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1 & beta; stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Results: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo.",Web of Science,10.1177/03635465231188122,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

(2016),2016,Anatomical Individualized ACL Reconstruction,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is composed of two bundles, which work together to provide both antero-posterior and rotatory stability of the knee. Understanding the anatomy and function of the ACL plays a key role in management of patients with ACL injury. Anatomic ACL reconstruction aims to restore the function of the native ACL. Femoral and tibial tunnels should be placed in their anatomical location accounting for both the native ACL insertion site and bony landmarks. One main component of anatomical individualized ACL reconstruction is customizing the treatment according to each patient's individual characteristics, considering preoperative and intraoperative evaluation of the native ACL and knee bony anatomy. Anatomical individualized reconstruction surgery should also aim to restore the size of the native ACL insertion as well. Using this concept, while single bundle ACL reconstruction can restore the function of the ACL in some patients, double bundle reconstruction is indicated in others to achieve optimal outcome.",Web of Science,,ARCHIVES OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-ABJS

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ACL reconstruction and extra-articular reconstruction on joint motion in the ACL-deficient knee and in the combined ACL and anterolateral capsule-deficient knee. Methods: An anterior tibial load of 134 N and internal tibial torque of 7 Nm were applied to 7 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees using a robotic testing system continuously throughout the range of flexion. The resulting joint motion was recorded for 6 knee states: intact, ACL-deficient, ACL-reconstructed, combined ACL and anterolateral capsule-deficient, ACL-reconstructed 1 anterolateral capsule-deficient, and ACL-reconstructed 1 extra-articular tenodesis. Results: Anterior tibial translation of the ACL-reconstructed 1 anterolateral capsule-deficient knee in response to an anterior tibial load was restored to that of the intact knee at all knee-flexion angles (p > 0.05). However, for this knee state, internal tibial rotation in response to internal tibial torque was not restored to that of the intact knee at 60 degrees or 90 degrees of knee flexion (p < 0.05). For the knee state of ACL-reconstructed 1 extra-articular tenodesis, internal rotation in response to internal tibial torque was restored to the motion of the intact knee at each of the tested knee-flexion angles (p > 0.05). Compared with the intact knee, 2 of 7 specimens showed decreased internal tibial rotation with ACL reconstruction 1 extra-articular tenodesis. Conclusions: In this study, an extra-articular tenodesis was necessary to restore rotatory knee stability in response to internal tibial torque in a combined ACL and anterolateral capsule-deficient knee. The amount of rotatory knee instability should be carefully assessed to avoid over-constraint of the knee in these combined ligament-reconstruction procedures.",Web of Science,10.2106/JBJS.16.01462,JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME

Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T-1 times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T-1 increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T-1 and T-2 after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the speed and localized specificity of automatic VBR analysis may translate well for clinical application, as seen in this multicenter study. (c) 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The proper diagnosis and treatment of multiple ligament knee injuries are essential, and careful evaluation and planning are required to achieve successful outcomes. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in the multiple ligament injured knee is complicated by several factors, necessitating additional technical considerations. Patient selection, surgical timing, graft selection, and surgical technique require consideration specific to the ACL component of these injuries. We present a summary of the current knowledge with respect to the treatment of ACL injuries in the context of the multiple ligament injured knee.",Web of Science,10.1055/s-0039-3400842,JOURNAL OF KNEE SURGERY
561,WS-185,Schon et al. (2016),2016,Anatomic Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction of the Knee Leads to Overconstraint at Any Fixation Angle,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are one of the most common injuries among athletes. However, the ability to fully restore rotational stability with ACL reconstruction (ACLR) remains a challenge, as evidenced by the persistence of rotational instability in up to 25% of patients after surgery. Advocacy for reconstruction of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) is rapidly increasing because some biomechanical studies have reported that the ALL is a significant contributor to internal rotational stability of the knee. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of ALL reconstruction (ALLR) graft fixation angle on knee joint kinematics in the clinically relevant setting of a concomitant ACLR and to determine the optimal ALLR graft fixation angle. It was hypothesized that all fixation angles would significantly reduce rotational laxity compared with the sectioned ALL state. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten nonpaired fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees underwent a full kinematic assessment in each of the following states: (1) intact; (2) anatomic single-bundle (SB) ACLR with intact ALL; (3) anatomic SB ACLR with sectioned ALL; (4) anatomic SB ACLR with 7 anatomic ALLR states using graft fixation angles of 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees; and (5) sectioned ACL and ALL. Internal rotation during a 5-Nm internal rotation torque and anterior translation during an 88-N anterior load were recorded at 15 degrees flexion intervals between 0 degrees and 120 degrees. Axial plane translation and internal rotation during a simulated pivot-shift test (combined 5-Nm internal rotation and 10-Nm valgus torques) were recorded between 0 degrees and 60 degrees. Kinematic changes were measured and compared with the intact state for all reconstructed and sectioned states. Results: Anatomic ALLR at all graft fixation angles significantly overconstrained internal rotation of the knee joint beyond 30 degrees of flexion and at 45 degrees and 60 degrees during the pivot-shift test. Furthermore, there were no significant knee kinematic differences between any tested graft fixation angles during anterior drawer, pivot-shift, and internal rotation tests. Conclusion: Anatomic ALLR in conjunction with an ACLR significantly reduced rotatory laxity of the knee beyond 30 degrees of knee flexion. However, ALLR, regardless of fixation angle, resulted in significant overconstraint of the knee. Clinical Relevance: ALLR at any fixation angle overconstrained native joint kinematics and should be performed with careful consideration. Further investigation into the application and target population for ALLR is strongly recommended.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546516652607,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
562,WS-186,Chambat et al. (2013),2013,The evolution of ACL reconstruction over the last fifty years,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has evolved considerably over the past 30 years. This has largely been due to a better understanding of ACL anatomy and in particular a precise description of the femoral and tibial insertions of its two bundles. In the 1980s, the gold standard was anteromedial bundle reconstruction using the middle third of the patellar ligament. Insufficient control of rotational laxity led to the development of double bundle ACL reconstruction. This concept, combined with a growing interest in preservation of the ACL remnant, led in turn to selective reconstruction in partial tears, and more recently to biological reconstruction with ACL remnant conservation. Current ACL reconstruction techniques are not uniform, depending on precise analysis of the type of lesion and the aspect of the ACL remnant in the intercondylar notch.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00264-012-1759-3,INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS
563,WS-187,Xie et al. (2022),2022,AOSSM 2022 Annual Meeting Abstracts Abstracts,"Objectives: Patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are at high risk for the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), despite ACL reconstruction (ACLR). ACL injuries are frequently associated with damage of other structures within the knee, such as the meniscus. The meniscus is an important structure that provides protection for articular cartilage and stabilization of the joint. Long-term studies of PTOA after ACLR mainly used radiographs. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used in a limited number of studies to evaluate structural damages, but this only provides information on morphologic changes that occur at relatively late stages of the disease. In this study, we aim to use quantitative MRI (qMRI) to evaluate cartilage and meniscus degeneration in patients at 10 years after ACLR. Methods: This is a multi-site multi-vendor study that involves three sites and two MR platforms (Siemens 3T and Philips 3T). MRI protocols have been harmonized between sites and cross validation data were collected using phantoms. The patients are from a nested cohort within Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Onsite Cohort at 10 years after ACLR. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were: 22-50 years old; ACL tear during a sport; no previous knee injury; no graft rupture during follow-up. In this preliminary report, 51 patients (age 32.8 +/- 6.4 years; 25 females; body mass index [BMI] 25.7 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2); 40 hamstring autograft, 9 bone-patellar tendonbone autograft, and 2 allograft) and 17 healthy control participants (age 30.8 +/- 7.8 years; 10 females; BMI 23.8 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2)) were studied. The MRI protocol included high-resolution Dual-Echo Steady State (DESS), and combined gradient echo MAPSS T1. and T2 mapping. Cartilage and meniscus were automatically segmented on DESS images using an in-house developed deeplearning model into medial/lateral femoral condyle (MFC/LFC), medial/lateral tibia (MT/LT), trochlear (TRO), and patellar cartilage (PAT), and medial and lateral menisci (MM/LM). Each cartilage compartment was further divided into sub-regions based on a modified MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) definition: central and posterior for MFC/LMC (cMFC/cLMC, pMFC/pLMC); anterior, central, and posterior for MT/LT (aMT/aLT, cMT/cLT, pMT/pLT); medial, central, and lateral for PAT/TRO (mPAT/mTRO, cPAT/cTRO, lPAT/lTRO). Menisci were further divided into anterior horn (aMM, aLM), central (body) (cMM, cLM), and posterior horn (pMM, pLM) subregions. These cartilage and menisci subregions were then transformed and overlaid onto the T1. and T2 parameter maps after co-registering the DESS image to the first echo of the 3D MAPSS sequence using the Elastix toolbox. T1. and T2 parameter maps were obtained by a voxel-wise two-parameter monoexponential fitting. The mean and standard deviation for each subregion was recorded and compared between three knee groups: operated and contralateral knees from patients, and control knees from healthy controls, using a mixed-effects regression model, adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Results: For cartilage, compared to contralateral knees, operated knees in patients had significantly higher T1. and T2 values in MFC, MT, and TRO compartments. Looking into subcompartments, for MFC, MT, and TRO, most of the subcompartments (cMFC, pMFC; cMT, pMT; mTRO, cTRO) showed significantly higher T1. and T2 values compared to contralateral knees. For LFC and LT, only the posterior subcompartments showed significantly higher T1. and T2 values compared to contralateral knees. For PAT, no significant differences were observed between operated and contralateral knees. Compared to healthy control knees, operated knees in patients had significantly higher T1. and T2 values in all the six compartments. Besides, contralateral knees also showed higher T1. and T2 values in LFC, LT and PAT compartments compared to healthy control knees (Figure 1 for T1., T2 with similar trend was not shown). For meniscus, no significant differences in T1. and T2 values were observed between injured and contralateral knees. Compared to healthy control knees, both operated and contralateral knees in patients had significantly higher T1. values in LM and significantly higher T2 values in MM (Figure 2). Conclusions: Cartilage T1. and T2 values were higher in operated knees compared to contralateral knees at 10 years after ACLR, except for patellar compartment. In patellar cartilage, no significant differences were observed between sides in patients, but both sides were significantly higher than control knees. Our data showed that contralateral knees after ACLR may not represent `healthy controls' as there might be compensatory changes and early degeneration in contralateral knees as a result of injury and surgery to their other knee. Although we observed this general trend of higher cartilage T1. and T2 values in the operated knees compared to contralateral knees, no significant differences were observed in meniscus T1. and T2 values between sides in patients, suggesting the timing of cartilage and meniscus degeneration may be different for patients after ACLR. Meniscus T1. and T2 values in both sides are higher than control knees, suggesting early degeneration in meniscus in patients in both sides. The results will be confirmed with more patient data being collected in the ongoing study. The relationship between qMRI, morphological tissue changes, and patient-reported outcomes after ACLR will also be evaluated in future work.",Web of Science,,ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
564,WS-188,Geeslin et al. (2018),2018,Anterolateral Knee Extra-articular Stabilizers A Robotic Study Comparing Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction and Modified Lemaire Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis,"Background: Persistent clinical instability after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction may be associated with injury to the anterolateral structures and has led to renewed interest in anterolateral extra-articular procedures. The influence of these procedures on knee kinematics is controversial. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to investigate the biomechanical properties of anatomic anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction and a modified Lemaire procedure (lateral extra-articular tenodesis [LET]) in combination with ACL reconstruction as compared with isolated ACL reconstruction in the setting of deficient anterolateral structures (ALL and Kaplan fibers). It was hypothesized that both techniques would reduce tibial internal rotation when combined with ACL reconstruction in the setting of anterolateral structure deficiency. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A 6 degrees of freedom robotic system was used to assess tibial internal rotation, a simulated pivot-shift test, and anterior tibial translation in 10 paired fresh-frozen cadaveric knees. The following states were tested: intact; sectioned ACL, ALL, and Kaplan fibers; ACL reconstruction; and an anterolateral extra-articular procedure (various configurations of ALL reconstruction and LET). Knees within a pair were randomly assigned to either ALL reconstruction or LET with a graft tension of 20 N and a randomly assigned fixation angle (30 degrees or 70 degrees). ALL reconstruction was then repeated and secured with a graft tension of 40 N. Results: In the setting of deficient anterolateral structures, ACL reconstruction was associated with significantly increased residual laxity for tibial internal rotation (up to 4 degrees) and anterior translation (up to 2 mm) laxity as compared with the intact state. The addition of ALL reconstruction or LET after ACL reconstruction significantly reduced tibial internal rotation in most testing scenarios to values lower than the intact state (ie, overconstraint). Significantly greater reduction in laxity with internal rotation and pivot-shift testing was found with the LET procedure than ALL reconstruction when compared with the intact state. Combined with ACL reconstruction alone, both extra-articular procedures restored anterior tibial translation to values not significantly different from the intact state with most testing scenarios (usually within 1 mm). Conclusion: Residual laxity was identified after isolated ACL reconstruction in the setting of ALL and Kaplan fiber deficiency, and the combination of ACL reconstruction in this setting with either ALL reconstruction or the modified Lemaire LET procedure resulted in significant reductions in tibiofemoral motion at most knee flexion angles, although overconstraint was also identified. ALL reconstruction and LET restored anterior tibial translation to intact values with most testing states. Clinical Relevance: ALL reconstruction and lateral extra-articular tenodesis have been described in combination with intra-articular ACL reconstruction to address rotational laxity. This study demonstrated that both procedures resulted in significant reductions of tibial internal rotation versus the intact state independent of graft tension or fixation angle, although anterior tibial translation was generally restored to intact values. The influence of overconstraint with anterolateral knee reconstruction procedures has not been fully evaluated in the clinical setting and warrants continued evaluation based on the findings of this biomechanical study.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546517745268,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
565,WS-189,Saki et al. (2022),2022,Female athletes with ligament dominance exhibiting altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns compared to healthy individuals during single-leg landing,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most serious knee injuries and occurs frequently during exercise. Altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns may contribute to dynamic knee valgus and ACL injury mechanisms. Lack of dynamic control of ground reaction force (GRF) is known to be contributing factor for ACL injury by placing excessive force on passive structures. Muscle co-contraction is a dynamic mechanism for GRF absorption. Therefore, any alterations in co-contraction might be a risk factor for ACL injury. Ligament dominance is a term to define individuals who rely more on ACL ligament for GRF control. Research question: This study aimed to compare the muscle co-contraction patterns of distal and proximal knee muscles during single leg landing in female athletes with and without ligament dominance. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 54 female athletes were assigned to the healthy (n = 27) and ligament dominance (n = 27) group based on their Tuck Jump test scores. The electromyography activity of the gluteus medius, adductor longus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured by an electromyography in drop down a 30-cm-high stair. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis (p <= 0.05). Results: The two groups demonstrated an overall significantly different muscle co-contraction patterns (P < 0.05). There was a decreased in co-contraction of proximal group and an increased co-contraction in the distal muscles in ligament dominant group. Significance: The findings have provided evidence to support the notion of neuromuscular imbalances in ligament dominance deficit. These findings can be useful for the coaches and experts to design preventive exercises and modify the current programs for the people affected by ligament dominance.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2022.02.011,GAIT & POSTURE
566,WS-190,Kim et al. (2012),2012,The Influence of Poster lateral Rotatory Instability on ACL Reconstruction Comparison Between Isolated ACL Reconstruction and ACL Reconstruction Combined with Posterolateral Corner Reconstruction,"Background: The purpose of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the influence of posterolateral corner reconstruction on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in terms of anterior laxity and clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that the effects of combined ACL and posterolateral corner reconstruction would be less satisfactory than those of isolated ACL reconstruction in terms of anterior laxity and clinical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively studied sixty-nine patients Who underwent ACL reconstruction from February 2001 to December 2005. Forty-six patients underwent isolated ACL reconstruction (Group l), and twenty-three patients underwent combined ACL and posterolatera I corner reconstruction (Group II). Clinical outcomes were determined from data obtained before surgery and at the time of the twenty-four-month follow-up examination. Results: Postoperatively, the mean side-to-side difference (and standard deviation) in anterior tibial translation, measured with a KT2000 arthrometer, was greater for Group 1(2.2 +/- 1.0 mm) than for Group 11 (1.6 +/- 0.8 mm) (p = 0.031). Seven knees (15.2%) in Group land two knees (8.7%) in Group II had grade-1 anterior translation. The mean Lysholm score was 93.2 in Group I and 90.1 in Group II (p = 0.392). Thirty-eight knees (82.6%) in Group I and twenty knees (87.0%) in Group II were classified as normal or nearly normal according to the International Knee Documentation Committee scoring system (p = 0.882). Conclusions: On the basis of the evaluation of ligamentous laxity with use of the KT2000 arthrometer, we observed that combined ACL and posterolateral corner reconstruction allows less anterior translation than isolated ACL reconstruction. However, we could not identify significant differences between the two groups in terms of functional outcomes.",Web of Science,10.2106/JBJS.J.01686,JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
567,WS-191,Thein et al. (2016),2016,Biomechanical Assessment of the Anterolateral Ligament of the Knee A Secondary Restraint in Simulated Tests of the Pivot Shift and of Anterior Stability,"Background: Injury to the lateral capsular tissues of the knee may accompany rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). A distinct lateral structure, the anterolateral ligament, has been identified, and reconstruction strategies for this tissue in combination with ACL reconstruction have been proposed. However, the biomechanical function of the anterolateral ligament is not well understood. Thus, this study had two research questions: (1) What is the contribution of the anterolateral ligament to knee stability in the ACL-sectioned knee? (2) Does the anterolateral ligament bear increased load in the absence of the ACL? Methods: Twelve cadaveric knees from donors who were a mean (and standard deviation) of 43 +/- 15 years old at the time of death were loaded using a robotic manipulator to simulate clinical tests of the pivot shift and anterior stability. Motions were recorded with the ACL intact, with the ACL sectioned, and with both the ACL and anterolateral ligament sectioned. In situ loads borne by the ACL and anterolateral ligament in the ACL-intact knee and borne by the anterolateral ligament in the ACL-sectioned knee were determined. Results: Sectioning the anterolateral ligament in the ACL-sectioned knee led to mean increases of 2 to 3 mm in anterior tibial translation in both anterior stability and simulated pivot-shift tests. In the ACL-intact knee, the load borne by the anterolateral ligament was a mean of <= 10.2 N in response to anterior loads and <17 N in response to the simulated pivot shift. In the ACL-sectioned knee, the load borne by the anterolateral ligament increased on average to < 55% of the load normally borne by the ACL in the intact knee. However, in the ACL-sectioned knee, the anterolateral ligament engaged only after the tibia translated beyond the physiologic limits of motion of the ACL-intact knee. Conclusions: The anterolateral ligament is a secondary stabilizer compared with the ACL for the simulated Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot shift examinations.",Web of Science,10.2106/JBJS.15.00344,JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
568,WS-192,Geeslin et al. (2018),2018,Anterolateral Knee Extra-articular Stabilizers A Robotic Sectioning Study of the Anterolateral Ligament and Distal Iliotibial Band Kaplan Fibers,"Background: The individual kinematic roles of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) and the distal iliotibial band Kaplan fibers in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency require further clarification. This will improve understanding of their potential contribution to residual anterolateral rotational laxity after ACL reconstruction and may influence selection of an anterolateral extra-articular reconstruction technique, which is currently a matter of debate. Hypothesis/Purpose: To compare the role of the ALL and the Kaplan fibers in stabilizing the knee against tibial internal rotation, anterior tibial translation, and the pivot shift in ACL-deficient knees. We hypothesized that the Kaplan fibers would provide greater tibial internal rotation restraint than the ALL in ACL-deficient knees and that both structures would provide restraint against internal rotation during a simulated pivot-shift test. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten paired fresh-frozen cadaveric knees (n = 20) were used to investigate the effect of sectioning the ALL and the Kaplan fibers in ACL-deficient knees with a 6 degrees of freedom robotic testing system. After ACL sectioning, sectioning was randomly performed for the ALL and the Kaplan fibers. An established robotic testing protocol was utilized to assess knee kinematics when the specimens were subjected to a 5-N.m internal rotation torque (0 degrees-90 degrees at 15 degrees increments), a simulated pivot shift with 10-N.m valgus and 5-N.m internal rotation torque (15 degrees and 30 degrees), and an 88-N anterior tibial load (30 degrees and 90 degrees). Results: Sectioning of the ACL led to significantly increased tibial internal rotation (from 0 degrees to 90 degrees) and anterior tibial translation (30 degrees and 90 degrees) as compared with the intact state. Significantly increased internal rotation occurred with further sectioning of the ALL (15 degrees-90 degrees) and Kaplan fibers (15 degrees, 60 degrees-90 degrees). At higher flexion angles (60 degrees-90 degrees), sectioning the Kaplan fibers led to significantly greater internal rotation when compared with ALL sectioning. On simulated pivot-shift testing, ALL sectioning led to significantly increased internal rotation and anterior translation at 15 degrees and 30 degrees; sectioning of the Kaplan fibers led to significantly increased tibial internal rotation at 15 degrees and 30 degrees and anterior translation at 15 degrees. No significant difference was found when anterior tibial translation was compared between the ACL/ALL- and ACL/Kaplan fiber-deficient states on simulated pivot-shift testing or isolated anterior tibial load. Conclusion: The ALL and Kaplan fibers restrain internal rotation in the ACL-deficient knee. Sectioning the Kaplan fibers led to greater tibial internal rotation at higher flexion angles (60 degrees-90 degrees) as compared with ALL sectioning. Additionally, the ALL and Kaplan fibers contribute to restraint of the pivot shift and anterior tibial translation in the ACL-deficient knee.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546518759053,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
569,WS-193,Jette et al. (2019),2019,Biomechanical comparison of anterolateral ligament anatomical reconstruction with a semi-anatomical lateral extra-articular tenodesis. A cadaveric study,"Background: To compare the biomechanical behavior of an anterolateral ligament (ALL) anatomical reconstruction and a semianatomical lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) in the context of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction combined with an anterolateral lesion. Methods: Twelve cadaveric knees were studied using a testing machine to assess the internal tibial rotation and anterior tibial translation across six surgical states: intact knee, ACL lesion, ACL + ALL lesion, ACL isolated reconstruction, ACL + ALL anatomical reconstruction and ACL + LET procedure. ALL and LET grafts were fixed at full knee extension and neutral rotation. Results: Presented with combined ACL and ALL lesions, isolated ACL reconstruction failed to restore the internal tibial rotation to intact-knee values (P> 0.05 for all angles). The addition of both an ALL reconstruction and LET procedure significantly reduced the internal rotation, restoring the rotation laxity to intact-knee values at 0 degrees and 30 degrees of flexion (P < 0.05) and with a certain level of overconstraint at 60 degrees and 90 degrees (mean 3 degrees +/- 2SD). A higher tendency to overconstraint was observed with the LET, but there was no significant difference when comparing the ALL reconstruction with the LET (P > 0.05 for all angles). Conclusions: Residual rotational laxity was found after isolated ACL reconstruction in the presence of an anterolateral lesion. The combination of ACL reconstruction with anatomical ALL reconstruction or the LET procedure resulted in restoration to intact-knee values but with a certain degree of overconstraint in higher flexion angles. Both techniques showed optimal biomechanical results with no data supporting the advantage of one over the other. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

570,WS-194,Goncharov et al. (2019),2019,Clinical experience with combined reconstruction of the anterior cruciate and anterolateral ligaments of the knee in sportsmen,"Background Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most common sports injuries of the knee joint. Today, we have a large number of approaches to arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament that lead to successful outcomes and allow the patients to return to a significant level of activity post-operatively. Nevertheless, the return to competitions rate stays relatively low. The functional state is thought to be dependent on rotational and anteroposterior stability of the knee. These data encourage search for methods of additional stabilization of the knee joint, one of them being extra-articular tenodesis, or reconstruction of anterolateral ligament of the knee. The aim of the study To evaluate medium-term results of combined simultaneous arthroscopic reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament and anterolateral ligament of the knee joint in sportsmen and to access the probability of return to competitions. Materials and methods The surgeries were performed in 2014-2015 in 50 patients who fulfilled the entry criteria: 20 patients (including 10 professional sportsmen) underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction together with reconstruction of anterolateral ligament-group 1 (main group), and 30 patients (including 10 professional sportsmen) underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction-group 2 (control group). Results Group 1: All patients of group 1 were able to return to the pre-operative sports level in two years after the surgery. The mean Tegner Lysholm score was 72.6 +/- 6.45 (hereinafter, SE-standard error) before the surgery and 97.4 +/- 1.18 after the surgery. The mean IKDC score was 63.1 +/- 4.8% before the surgery and 96.3 +/- 1.8% after the surgery. Group 2: 20 of 30 patients (66.7%) returned to the pre-operative level of activity and returned to competitions (if they were professional sportsmen) in a year after the surgery. Five of ten patients (50%) (professional sportsmen) returned to competitions. Fifteen of 20 patients (75%) (amateur sportsmen) also returned to competitions. The mean pre-operative Tegner Lysholm score was 69.6 +/- 3.5, and the mean post-operative score was 92.1 +/- 3.9. The mean pre-operative IKDC score was 73.4 +/- 3.2%, and the mean post-operative score was 90.3 +/- 3.7%. Conclusion The results of the study show that more patients with higher functional demands and more professional sportsmen returned to sports. Despite the results of our and other foreign studies, a need remains for studies that will compare outcomes of ALL reconstruction with the same surgical technique in homogenous groups of patients.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00264-019-04409-8,INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS
571,WS-195,Zens et al. (2015),2015,Length Changes of the Anterolateral Ligament During Passive Knee Motion: A Human Cadaveric Study,"Background: Persistent rotatory instability after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction may be a result of unaddressed insufficiency of the anterolateral structures. Recent publications about the anatomy of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) have led to a renewed interest in lateral extra-articular procedures, and several authors have proposed ALL reconstruction to supplement intra-articular ACL reconstruction. However, only limited knowledge about the biomechanical characteristics of the ALL exists. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to analyze length changes of the ALL during passive knee motion. The study hypothesis was that the ALL lengthens with knee flexion and internal tibial rotation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The ALL of 6 cadaveric knees was dissected. Specimens were mounted in a specifically designed test rig that allowed unconstrained passive flexion/extension movement between 0 degrees and 90 degrees as well as external/internal tibial rotation of 25 degrees at various flexion angles. Highly elastic, capacitive polydimethylsiloxane strain gauges were attached to the insertion sites of the ALL. Length changes were recorded continuously at flexion angles between 0 degrees and 90 degrees and during internal/external tibial rotation at 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees. All measurements were calculated as the relative length change (%) of the ALL compared with 0 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation. Results: The mean relative length of the ALL significantly increased with increasing knee flexion (P < .001), with an estimated mean length change of +0.15% per degree. Both internal and external tibial rotation were independent determinants for length change; internal rotation significantly increased the length of the ALL (P < .001), whereas external rotation significantly decreased its length (P < .001). The mean length change with internal rotation increased with knee flexion, with a significantly greater length change at 90 degrees compared with 0 degrees (P = .048), 15 degrees (P = .033), and 30 degrees (P = .015). The maximum mean length change was +33.77% 9.62%, which was observed at 25 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of flexion. Conclusion: The ALL is a nonisometric structure that tensions with knee flexion and internal tibial rotation. Length changes with internal rotation were greater at higher flexion angles, with the greatest length change of the ALL observed at 90 degrees of flexion. Clinical Relevance: The ALL can be considered a stabilizer against internal tibial rotation, especially at deep flexion angles. With regard to ALL reconstruction procedures, tensioning and fixation of the graft should be performed near 90 degrees of flexion because graft tensioning near extension may cause excessive ligament strain with increasing knee flexion.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546515594373,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
572,WS-196,Lording et al. (2017),2017,Rotational Laxity Control by the Anterolateral Ligament and the Lateral Meniscus Is Dependent on Knee Flexion Angle: A Cadaveric Biomechanical Study,"Background Injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) has been reported to contribute to high-grade anterolateral laxity after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Failure to address ALL injury has been suggested as a cause of persistent rotational laxity after ACL reconstruction. Lateral meniscus posterior root (LMPR) tears have also been shown to cause increased internal rotation of the knee. Qustions/purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the functional relationship between the ALL and LMPR in the control of internal rotation of the ACL-deficient knee. Specifically: (1) We asked if there was a difference in internal rotation among: the intact knee; the ACL-deficient knee; the ACL/ALL-deficient knee; the ACL/LMPR-deficient knee; and the ACL/ALL/LMPR-deficient knee. (2) We also asked if there was a difference in anterior translation among these conditions. Methods Sixteen fresh frozen cadaveric knee specimens (eight men, mean age 79 years) were potted into a hip simulator (femur) and a 6 degree-of-freedom load cell (tibia). Rigid optical trackers were inserted into the proximal femur and distal tibia, allowing for the motion of the tibia with respect to the femur to be tracked during biomechanical tests. A series of points on the femur and tibia were digitized to create bone coordinate systems that were used to calculate internal rotation and anterior translation. Biomechanical testing involved applying a 5-Nm internal rotation moment to the tibia from full extension to 90A degrees of flexion. Anterior translation was performed by applying a 90-N anterior load using a tensiometer. Both tests were performed in 15A degrees increments tested sequentially in the following conditions: (1) intact; and (2) ACL injury (ACL-). The specimens were then randomized to either have the ALL sectioned (3) first (M+/ALL-); or (4) the LMPR sectioned first (M-/ALL+) followed by the other structure (M-/ALL-). A one-way analysis of variance was performed for each sectioning condition at each angle of knee flexion (alpha = 0.05). Results At 0A degrees of flexion there was an effect of tissue sectioning such that internal rotation of the M-/ALL- condition was greater than ACL- by 1.24A degrees (p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-2.70) and the intact condition by 2.5A degrees (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.69-3.91). In addition, the mean (SD) internal rotations for the M+/ALL- (9.99A degrees [5.39A degrees]) and M-/ALL+ (12.05A degrees [5.34A degrees]) were greater by 0.87A degrees (p = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.13-3.83) and by 2.15A degrees, respectively, compared with the intact knee. At 45A degrees the internal rotation for the ACL- (19.15A degrees [9.49A degrees]), M+/ALL- (23.70A degrees [7.00A degrees]), and M-/ALL- (18.80A degrees [8.27A degrees]) conditions was different than the intact (12.78A degrees [9.23A degrees]) condition by 6.37A degrees (p = 0.02; 95% CI, 1.37-11.41), 8.47A degrees (p < 0.01; 95% CI, 3.94-13.00), and 6.02A degrees (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 1.73-10.31), respectively. At 75A degrees there was a 10.11A degrees difference (p < 0.01; 95% CI, 5.20-15.01) in internal rotation between the intact (13.96A degrees [5.34A degrees]) and the M+/ALL- (23.22A degrees [4.46A degrees]) conditions. There was also a 4.08A degrees difference (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 1.14-7.01) between the intact and M-/ALL- (18.05A degrees [7.31A degrees]) conditions. Internal rotation differences of 6.17A degrees and 5.43A degrees were observed between ACL- (16.28A degrees [6.44A degrees]) and M+/ALL- (p < 0.01; 95% CI, 2.45-9.89) as well as between M+/ALL- and M-/ALL- (p = 0.01; 95% CI, -8.17 to -1.63). Throughout the range of flexion, there was no difference in anterior translation with progressive section of the ACL, meniscus, or ALL. Conclusion The ALL and LMPR both play a role in aiding the ACL in controlling internal rotation laxity in vitro; however, these effects seem to be dependent on flexion angle. The ALL has a greater role in controlling internal rotation at flexion angles > 30(o). The LMPR appears to have more of an effect on controlling rotation closer to extension.",Web of Science,10.1007/s11999-017-5364-z,CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
573,WS-197,Moatshe et al. (2017),2017,Multiple Ligament Reconstruction Femoral Tunnels: Intertunnel Relationships and Guidelines to Avoid Convergence,"Background: Knee dislocations often require multiple concurrent ligament reconstructions, which involve creating several tunnels in the distal femur. Therefore, the risk of tunnel convergence is increased because of the limited bone volume within the distal aspect of the femur. Purpose: To assess the risk of tunnel convergence and determine the optimal reconstruction tunnel orientations for multiple ligament reconstructions in the femur. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Three-dimensional knee models were developed from computed tomography scans of 21 patients. Medical image processing software was used to create tunnels for each of the primary ligamentous structures, replicating a surgical approach that would be used in multiple ligament reconstructions. Thereafter, the tunnel orientation was varied in surgically relevant directions to determine orientations that minimized the risk of tunnel convergence. The orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tunnels was held constant throughout the study, while the orientation of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL) tunnels was varied to avoid convergence. Results: A high risk of tunnel convergence was observed between the FCL and ACL tunnels when the FCL tunnel was aimed at 0 degrees in the axial and coronal planes. Aiming the FCL tunnel 35 degrees anteriorly minimized convergence with the ACL tunnel. No tunnel convergence was observed for the PLT tunnel aimed 35 degrees anteriorly and parallel to the FCL tunnel. To avoid convergence between the sMCL and PCL tunnels, the sMCL tunnels should be aimed 40 degrees proximally in the coronal plane and 20 degrees to 40 degrees anteriorly. During concomitant POL reconstruction, the sMCL should be aimed 40 degrees proximally and anteriorly and the POL 20 degrees proximally and anteriorly. The PLT and POL tunnels aimed at 0 degrees in both the coronal and axial planes had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. Conclusion: Femoral tunnel orientations during multiple ligament reconstructions need to be adjusted to avoid tunnel convergence. On the lateral side, aiming the FCL and PLT tunnels 35 degrees anteriorly eliminated convergence with the ACL tunnel. On the medial side, tunnel convergence was avoided by orienting the sMCL tunnel 40 degrees proximally and anteriorly and the POL tunnel 20 degrees proximally and anteriorly. The POL and PLT tunnels aimed at 0 degrees in the axial plane had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. Clinical Relevance: The risk of tunnel convergence with the ACL and PCL femoral tunnels can be reduced by adjusting the orientation of the FCL and PLT tunnels and the sMCL and POL tunnels, respectively.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546516673616,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
574,WS-198,Mehl et al. (2019),2019,Posteromedial Ligament Repair of the Knee With Suture Tape Augmentation: A Biomechanical Study,"Background: In cases of acute combined posteromedial and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, primary repair of the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) and posterior oblique ligament (POL) with suture tape augmentation may be a reasonable alternative to standard tendon reconstruction techniques. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to examine the rotational and valgus laxity with ACL strain following sMCL and POL repair with suture tape augmentation at various degrees of knee flexion. It was hypothesized that this technique would restore knee laxity and kinematics comparable with those of the intact state. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten cadaveric knee specimens (mean +/- SD, 57.9 +/- 5.9 years) were obtained. Specimens were tested with the tibia fixed and the femur mobile on an X-Y table. Each specimen was tested in 4 conditions according to the state of the sMCL and POL: native, deficient, repaired with suture tape augmentation, and reconstructed with tendon allografts. Valgus laxity was tested with 40-N force applied in the lateral direction of the femur, and rotational motion was tested with 5-N torque applied to the tibia. ACL strain during valgus stress was also measured. Each condition was tested in 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees of knee flexion. Results: Dissection of the sMCL and POL led to significantly increased valgus laxity in all flexion angles, with a significant increase in ACL strain at 30 degrees (P < .001) and 45 degrees (P < .001). Ligament repair with suture tape augmentation demonstrated similar valgus and rotational laxity as compared with intact specimens, with the exception of increased internal rotation at 30 degrees (P = .005). Ligament reconstruction resulted in significantly increased valgus opening at 45 degrees (P = .048) and significantly increased internal rotation at 30 degrees (P < .001) as compared with the native state. Direct comparison between surgical techniques showed no significant differences. Conclusion: At time zero, ligament repair of the posteromedial knee with suture tape augmentation restored close-to-native valgus and rotatory laxity, as well as native ACL strain for cases of complete sMCL and POL avulsion.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546519868961,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
575,WS-199,KANNUS et al. (1991),1991,INJURIES TO THE POSTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT OF THE KNEE,"The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament about the knee and is approximately twice as strong as the anterior cruciate ligament. Its main function is to prevent the posterior dislocation of the tibia in relation to the femur, providing 95% of the strength to resist the tibial posterior displacement. Along with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) the PCL controls the passive 'screw home' mechanism of the knee in terminal knee extension. It also provides mechanical support for the collateral ligaments during valgus or varus stress of the knee. PCL ruptures are uncommon apparently due to its strong fibre structure. The most frequent injury mechanism in isolated PCL tears is a direct blow on the anterior tibia with the knee flexed thus driving the tibia posteriorly. Automobile accidents (in which the knee hits the dashboard) and soccer injuries (in which an athlete receives a blow to the anterior surface of the tibia during knee flexion) characteristically produce this type of injury. In other PCL injury mechanisms (hyperextension, hyperflexion or rotational injuries with associated valgum/varum stress), other knee structures are also often damaged. The most characteristic diagnostic finding in a knee with a PCL rupture is the 'posterior sag sign' meaning the apparent disappearance of the tibial tubercle in lateral inspection when the knee is flexed 90-degrees. This is due to gravity-assisted posterior displacement of the tibia in relation to the femur. A positive posterior drawer test performed at 90-degrees of flexion and a knee hyperextension sign are sensitive but nonspecific tests. False negative findings are frequent, especially in acute cases. If necessary, the clinical diagnosis of the PCL tear can be verified by magnetic resonance imaging, examination under anaesthesia, arthroscopy, or a combination of these modalities. If a PCL avulsion fragment has been dislocated, surgical treatment is recommended. In isolated, complete midsubstance tears of the PCL the majority of the recent studies recommend conservative treatment, since abnormal residual posterior laxity1 in most of these knees is consistent with functional stability and minimal symptoms. This has been the case even in athletes. In isolated PCL tears, the outcome seems to depend more on the muscular (quadriceps) status of the knee than on the amount of residual posterior laxity. Therefore, the conservative treatment protocol emphasises intensive quadriceps exercises, and only a short (under 2 weeks) immobilisation period followed by early controlled activities and early weightbearing. According to the current concept, acute phase surgery (primary PCL repair with augmentation, or primary PCL reconstruction) is indicated in fresh injuries of the PCL associated with disruptions of other major ligaments or capsular structures. Simultaneously with the PCL surgery, all the other damaged structures should also be repaired. Even with surgery, however, the prognosis is poorer than in isolated PCL tears. In chronic PCL insufficiency a reconstruction with bonepatella tendon-bone autograft or allograft can be considered, if the patient suffers from repeated giving way symptoms which are not resolved by rehabilitation.",Web of Science,10.2165/00007256-199112020-00004,SPORTS MEDICINE
576,WS-200,Weber et al. (2025),2025,Reconstruction of the sMCL for the surgical treatment of anteromedial instability of the knee joint,"Ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament are often associated with concomitant injuries to the medial capsule-ligamentous complex. An anteromedial rotational instability may result, leading to increased anterior translation of the medial tibial plateau. Biomechanical studies have shown that the sMCL and dMCL, in particular, play a significant role in the anteromedial rotational instability. In such cases, isolated treatment of the central pillar seems insufficient. Therefore, additional stabilization of the medial capsule-ligamentous complex should be considered to prevent, among other things, early graft failure.In the present case, anteromedial rotational instability was treated with a minimally invasive single-strand reconstruction of the sMCL.

577,WS-201,Ferrari et al. (2017),2017,Multiligament Reconstruction of the Knee in the Setting of Knee Dislocation With a Medial-Sided Injury,"Multiple ligament knee injuries are complex pathologies that often result from traumatic knee dislocations. Both a high level of suspicion and a thorough clinical and radiographic examination are mandatory to diagnose and identify all injured structures. Reconstruction of all injured ligaments is recommended to aid in early mobilization and to avoid joint stiffness or graft failure. For knee dislocations involving injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and medial-sided structures, a repair and augmentation of the medial collateral ligament, together with an anatomic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament and double-bundle posterior cruciate ligament, is recommended. In the setting of these complex reconstructions, there are several technical aspects that require consideration to ensure concise and efficient treatment of these injuries. Graft choice, sequence of reconstruction, tunnel position and orientation, and graft tensioning all pose surgical challenges, and require dedicated preoperative preparation and planning. The purpose of this Technical Note is to report a safe, effective, and reproducible surgical technique for treatment of multiligament injuries in the setting of a knee dislocation with a medial-sided component (classified as KD-III-M in the Schenck classification system).",Web of Science,10.1016/j.eats.2016.10.003,ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES

(2024),2024,Functional Outcomes of Anatomic Single Bundle Primary ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon (Without a Peroneal Tenodesis) Versus Hamstring Autografts,"Objectives: There is a paucity of comparative studies on the Peroneus longus tendon versus conventional hamstring autograft use in primary single -bundle ACL reconstruction. To date, there are no studies that reported donor ankle functional outcomes when a peroneus longus graft is harvested without performing a tenodesis to peroneus brevis. Methods: A single -center retrospective comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcomes (IKDC & Tegner-Lysholm scores) of primary isolated single bundle anatomic ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus tendon (PL group) versus Hamstring (HT group) autografts. Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. Results: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre -op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre -op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre -op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre -op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon appears to be a better autograft choice than hamstrings for primary ACL reconstruction. Further, without a peroneal tenodesis, the functional outcomes of the donor ankle remained excellent.

579,WS-203,Ali et al. (2024),2024,Prospective comparative study between peroneus longus tendon autograft and hamstring tendons autograft in single bundle ACL reconstruction,"BackgroundACL reconstruction is often regarded as the most effective approach of restoring knee stability. Several graft possibilities are available, including (BPTB), four-strand hamstring autografts, quadriceps tendon, and peroneus longus tendon. Each has both advantages and cons. This study compares the effectiveness of peroneus longus and hamstring tendon autografts for single bundle ACL restoration.Patients and MethodsThe study involved 60 patients. Thirty of them had their torn anterior cruciate ligaments reconstructed arthroscopically using hamstring tendons, while the other 30 had their ACLs managed arthroscopically with peroneus longus tendon. The follow-up period lasted at least 12 months. Patients were assessed using IKDC score and Lysholm score. Ankle function was assessed using AOFAS score.ResultsThere was a statistically significant difference in preoperative and postoperative range of motion improvement in each group as an IKDC score item. However, no statistically significant difference existed between both groups. A statistically significant change in Lysholm scores preoperatively and postoperatively in each group was detected, but there was no statistical difference between groups 1 and 2, either in terms of improvement or percentage improvement. The AOFAS score was used also to assess for any donor site morbidity. No significant difference was detected between both ankles range of motion and no ankle joint dysfunction or problems with sports activities.ConclusionThe current study found that the PL tendon autograft might be considered a safe, effective and a technically easy graft option for ACLR. The research shows no substantial difference in postoperative knee stability or graft failure rate between hamstring and peroneus tendons.",Web of Science,10.1080/20905068.2024.2413316,ALEXANDRIA JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

The aim of this study is to evaluate the biomechanical properties of the PLT to assess its usability in frequently performed reconstructions. Methods: Six fresh-frozen, below-knee cadavers with a mean age of 65 years, no previous surgical operation, and no history of chronic disease were used. PLTs were harvested, freed from muscle tissue, and prepared for tensile strength testing at a tensile force rate of 2 mm/min using a Shimadzu Autograph AG-IS 100 kN instrument (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Results: The maximum tensile force varied between 600.7 N and 1131.313 N, with a median of 758.185 N. All tendons had diameters of 8 mm or more. The elongation at maximum force ranged from 9.0 mm to 16.0 mm, with a median of 14.0 mm. Conclusion: According to this study, PLT is a viable choice for surgeries involving autograft reconstruction. However, further clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in reconstructive surgeries.",Web of Science,10.7759/cureus.66683,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
583,WS-207,Arora et al. (2024),2024,Lower Limb Length and Body Weight are Surrogate Predictors of Peroneus Longus Autograft Diameter,"Introduction Graft diameters are essential in any ACL surgery, with diameters less than 8mm associated with higher revision rates. Peroneus longus (PL) grafts have garnered much attention recently due to ease of harvest and more reliable graft diameters. The present study aimed to study various anthropometric parameters associated with PL-graft diameters. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of 50 patients undergoing PL harvest for ACL surgery at a tertiary referral hospital. Age, gender, height, weight, length of the lower leg (lateral tibial plateau to the tip of the fibula), circumference at the head of the fibula and girth at the lateral malleolus were measured pre-operatively. The length of the graft doubled and tripled graft diameters were assessed intra-operatively. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the association between the pre-operative anthropometric variables and the intra-operative graft diameters and length of graft harvested. Results The mean doubled and tripled PL-graft diameter in our study population was 7.7 +/- 0.9 mm and 8.7 +/- 0.8 mm, respectively. The mean length of the graft was 25.9 +/- 3.5 cm. We found no significant correlation between graft diameters and age, gender or height of the patient. We found that the patient's weight significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with graft diameter. We also found that the length of the lower leg (p < 0.0001), circumference at the head of the fibula (p = 0.001) and girth at the lateral malleolus (p = 0.029) showed significant correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter. Conclusion We found that weight, length of the lower leg and girth at the head of the fibula showed a strong correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter.",Web of Science,10.1007/s43465-024-01266-5,INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS
584,WS-208,Luo et al. (2023),2023,Preoperative ultrasound can accurately predict the diameter of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon autografts,"PurposeThis study aimed to determine the correlation between the intraoperative diameter of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon (2PLT) and length of the PLT autograft and preoperative ultrasound (US) measurements, as well as radiographic and anthropometric measurements. The hypothesis was that US can accurately predict the diameter of 2PLT autografts during operation.MethodsTwenty-six patients underwent ligament reconstruction with 2PLT autografts were included. Preoperative US was used to calculate the in situ PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) at seven levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 cm proximal to the harvest start point). Femoral width, notch width, notch height, maximum patellar length, and patellar tendon length were determined on preoperative radiographs. Intraoperative measurements of PLT were made, including all fiber lengths of PLT and diameters of 2PLT using sizing tubes calibrated to 0.5 mm.ResultsCSA at 1 cm proximal to the harvest site had the highest correlation with the diameter of 2PLT (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Calf length had the highest correlation with PLT length (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The diameter of the 2PLT autografts could be predicted by the following formula: 4.6 + 0.2 x [sonographic CSA of PLT at 1 cm level]; the length of PLT could be predicted by the following formula: 5.6 + 0.5 x Calf length.ConclusionThe diameter of 2PLT and length of PLT autografts can be accurately predicted by preoperative US and calf length measurements, respectively. Accurate preoperative prediction of the diameter and length of autologous grafts can provide the most suitable and individualized graft for patients.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00167-023-07406-y,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
585,WS-209,Rhatomy et al. (2019),2019,Peroneus longus autograft can be recommended as a superior graft to hamstring tendon in single-bundle ACL reconstruction,"Purpose A peroneus longus tendon autograft is used in many orthopaedic procedures and it is biomechanically comparable to a hamstring tendon autograft. Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity of ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts versus peroneus longus tendon autografts in patients with an isolated ACL injury. Methods Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. Results Fifty-two patients (hamstring n = 28, peroneus n = 24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8 +/- 0.7 mm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2 +/- 0.8 mm) (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3 +/- 4.2 and for the FADI 98 +/- 3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p = 0.002). Conclusion Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00167-019-05455-w,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY

Methods A total of 21 eligible patients (mean age 34.0 years (standard deviation (SD) 11.2); mean follow-up period 31.8 months (SD 7.7), and 12 healthy controls (mean age, 26.8 years (SD 5.9) were included. For patients, clinical evaluation of the donor ankle was performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Square hop test, ankle strength assessment, and MRI of distal calf were assessed bilaterally in the final follow-up. The morphological symmetry of peroneal tendons bilaterally was evaluated by MRI in healthy controls. Results Among the patients, the mean pre- and postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score and Karisson-Peterson score were 98.7 (SD 2.5; p = 0.480) and 98.5 (SD 2.4; p = 0.480), and 98.3 (SD 2.4; p = 0.162) and 97.9 (SD 2.5; p = 0.162), respectively. There was no significant difference between square hop test bilaterally (p = 0.109) and plantar flexion peak force bilaterally (p = 0.371). The harvested limb had significantly less eversion peak force compared to the contralateral limb (p < 0.001). Evidence of probable tendon regeneration was observed in all the patients by MRI and the total bilateral peroneal tendon index (mean ratio of harvested side cross-sectional area of peroneal tendon compared with the contralateral side) was 82.9% (SD 17.4). In 12 healthy controls, peroneal tendons (mean 99.4% (SD 4.3) were found to be morphologically symmetrical between the two sides.

587,WS-211,Lord et al. (2018),2018,ACL graft compression: a method to allow reduced tunnel sizes in ACL reconstruction,"A common problem during ACL reconstruction is asymmetry of proximal-distal graft diameter leading to tunnel upsizing and graft-tunnel mismatch. Compression downsizing provides a graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique and its effects on graft biomechanics and stability. It was hypothesised that compression downsizing would significantly reduce cross-sectional area (CSA); that no significant changes in graft biomechanics would occur; graft fixation stability would be improved. Sixty-eight non-irradiated peroneus longus (PL) tendons were investigated. Twenty were halved and paired into ten four-strand grafts, 20 strands were compressed by 0.5-1 mm diameter and changes in CSA recorded using an alginate mould technique. The following properties were compared with 20 control strands: cyclic strain when loaded 70-220 N for 1000 cycles; stiffness; ultimate tensile load and stress; Young's modulus. 24 PL tendons were quadrupled into grafts, 12 were compressed and all 24 were submerged in Ringer's solution at 37 A degrees C and the CSA recorded over 12 h. Twelve compressed and 12 control quadrupled grafts were mounted in porcine femurs, placed in Ringer's solution for 12 h at 37 A degrees C and graft displacement at the bone tunnel aperture recorded under cyclic loading. Mean decreases in CSA of 31% under a stress of 471 kPa and 21% under a stress of 447 kPa were observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19% over 12 h compared to 2% for controls. No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability; mean cyclic displacements were 0.3 mm for both groups. No detrimental biomechanical effects of graft compression on allograft PL tendons were observed. Following compression, the grafts significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability between groups. Graft compression did not cause adverse mechanical effects in vitro. Smaller tunnels for compressed grafts reduce bone loss and ease anatomical placement.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00167-018-4932-4,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY

In this study, we sought to evaluate the existence of a correlation between specific anthropometric parameters and the size of some ankle tendons measured on MRI, in particular those mostly used as graft in ankle surgery. Methods We recorded gender, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of 113 patients (57 females; mean age: 42 +/- 18) who underwent ankle MRI. MRI measurements performed by a radiologist were: axial shortest diameter of Achilles (AT), posterior tibialis (PTT), flexor digitorum longus (FDLT), flexor hallucis longus (FHLT), peroneus longus (PLT), and anterior tibialis (ATT) tendons, intermalleolar distance (ID) and talus width (TW). Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used. After applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, statistical significance was set at p < 0.002. Results The mean patient height, weight and BMI were 169 +/- 9.8 cm (range: 140-193), 72.4 +/- 16.4 kg (range: 44-142), and 25 +/- 5.7 (range: 16-50), respectively. The mean ankle measurements were: AT = 5.3 +/- 1.4 mm, PTT = 3.3 +/- 0.6 mm, FDLT = 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm, FHLT = 2.7 +/- 0.4 mm, PLT = 2.9 +/- 0.5 mm, ATT = 3 +/- 0.6 mm, ID = 62.9 +/- 4.5 mm, and TW = 28.8 +/- 2.5 mm. A statistical difference between male and female patients was observed regarding ID (z = -6.955, p < .001), TW (z = -6.692, p < .001), AT (z = -3.587, p < .001), PTT (z = -3.783, p < .001), and FDLT (z = -3.744, p < .001). Both PTT and FDLT showed a significant correlation with ID (p < .001) and TW (p < .001). ATT size was significantly correlated with weight, ID and TW (all with p < 0.001). PLT and AT showed a significant correlation only with ID and weight (p <= .001), respectively. Conclusion Our data might help orthopaedists in preoperative planning to identify the best graft for ankle surgical procedures including tendon transfers.",Web of Science,10.1007/s11547-020-01177-z,RADIOLOGIA MEDICA

(2024),2024,Evaluation of the peroneus longus tendon as an autologous graft in knee surgery,"Our hypothesis is that the peroneus longus (PL) is a great option for ligament reconstruction in the knee, and therefore the objective of the study is to determine if the use of this graft is safe and does not cause secondary damage to the harvested area. A prospective study was conducted between April 2019 and September 2022. Patients who underwent any type of knee ligament reconstruction using the PL or just the anterior half (AHPL) as grafts were followed up. These patients were evaluated according to the Tegner-Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) guidelines for functional evaluation of the knee and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) for the functional evaluation of the ankle. Most patients had an increase in the IKDC score, Tegner-Lysholm score, AOFAS and FADI regardless of the graft used in the surgical procedure, with mean values at the 24-month follow-up of, respectively, 99.02 +/- 0.02, 98.69 +/- 0.08, 99.92 +/- 0.07, and 99.92 +/- 0.07 for those with PL grafts and 99.31 +/- 0.54, 98.88 +/- 0.95, 100 +/- 0.00, and 100 +/- 0.00 for those with AHPL grafts. The differences in the scores between the two graft groups during each of the follow-up periods were significant (P = 0.001). The use of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft in knee surgeries was shown to be adequate for achieving good knee functional results.",Web of Science,10.1038/s41598-024-76779-y,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

An alternative that has received little attention in Europe but is very popular in Asia is harvesting of the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (split graft). The aim of this article is to describe the removal technique of a peroneus longus split graft. The surgical approach is via an approximately 1-2 cm long skin incision posterior to the fibula just above the lateral malleolus. After splitting the subcutaneous layers and the fascia, the peroneus tendons are located: The peroneus longus tendon lies posterior and lateral to the peroneus brevis tendon. This is circumvented with a clamp and incised centrally along the fibers. The anterior half is reinforced with baseball stitch sutures and then severed distally. The anterior half of the tendon is then separated by a tendon stripper and detached from the peroneus longus muscle. The mean graft length is ca. 29 cm. Previous reports on this transplant in the literature have been positive; however, there have been reports of donor site morbidity in the ankle joint.",Web of Science,10.1007/s00142-024-00700-y,ARTHROSKOPIE

However, clinical data on graft size are limited. Purpose: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. Results: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 +/- 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 +/- 0.7 cm for the ST (P < .05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 +/- 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 +/- 0.7 mm for the ST (P < .05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P < .01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P < .01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P > .05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P < .05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P > .05). Conclusion: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length. However, predicting graft diameter based on thigh or shank circumference was more challenging, with higher BMIs affecting the ability to predict ST more than AHPLT.",Web of Science,10.1177/03635465231165297,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
593,WS-217,Farag¢ et al.

Methods Two types of grafts were harvested from human cadavers: 165 tibialis anterior (TA) and 166 peroneus longus (PL) tendons. According to the two types of sterilization methods (gamma and electron beam irradiation) or the lack of one, and the six types of storage time (one to six months), 36 groups were created. In addition, we created a 1 to 1 native group, which was not sterilized and stored, tested within four hours of collection. Results In the results of tendon type TA compared to TA native group, we observed significant differences at the fifth month of storage for all measured parameters. Load at first break of the frozen values at the fifth month was significantly inferior to the native group (p = 0.034). For strain at first break and strain at maximum load, all sterilization methods were significantly inferior at the fifth month (p = 0.003 to p = 0.009). Maximum load values were significantly superior with E-beam irradiation at the fifth month (p = 0.003), and also significantly higher with gamma irradiation at the fifth month (p = 0.009). Young's modulus showed significantly inferior values in the frozen tendons at the fifth month (p = 0.001 to p = 0.003). In tendon type PL, no significant differences were found for any of the tested parameters compared to the native group. Conclusion Our results indicate that freezing alters mechanical properties via the decrease seen in the ultimate tensile strength. In addition, at the fifth and sixth months of storage, time could notably affect allografts rather than the sterilization procedures.",Web of Science,10.1302/2046-3758.143.BJR-2024-0129.R2,BONE & JOINT RESEARCH
594,WS-218,Zhu et al. (2018),2018,A prospective study of coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with autogenous peroneus longus tendon for acromioclavicular joint dislocations,"Background: Anatomic coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction (ACCR) provides good outcomes for Rockwood type III and VI acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations. Various grafts have been used, but complications from graft harvesting are not uncommon. This study examined the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with AC joint dislocations repaired with the autogenous anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) to achieve ACCR. Methods: Patients with a Rockwood type III to V AC joint dislocation and magnetic resonance imaging of the disruption of the CC ligaments, as well as the AC capsule, were prospectively recruited. Patients received ACCR using an autogenous AHPLT graft and were evaluated clinically and radiographically pre-operatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Results: A total of 18 patients (mean age, 51 years) were prospectively recruited and received an autogenous AHPLT graft ACCR. Fifteen patients completed clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations at 12 months. The mean Constant score (CS) was 51 preoperatively and 93 at 12 months (P < .005). No significant difference was noted at 12 months between the CS of the injured and contralateral shoulder. The mean American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score at 12 months was 99, and this was not different from the value at any other time point. Loss of reduction occurred in 10 patients (56%), and tunnel widening was observed in 9 (50%), but neither was significantly correlated with functional outcome. Conclusion: Autogenous AHPLT appears to be a reliable tendon graft source for CC ligament reconstruction. (C) 2017 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

The method of simultaneous reconstruction of anterior cruciate and lateral ligaments with a peroneus longus tendon autograft was described. The method of reconstruction of antero-lateral stability of knee joint we mean is simple and effective, because the tendon autograft is long and strong, and peroneus longus tendon is located out of knee joint proection.

Outcomes included morphology (tissue length, ultrasound-quantified cross-sectional area [CSAUS], and major and minor axes), biomechanics (failure load, ultimate tensile strength [UTS], failure strain, and elastic modulus), and biochemistry (sulfated glycosaminoglycan [sGAG] and hydroxyproline contents). Tissue differences were analyzed using mixed-model regression.Results: There was a range of similarities and differences between tendons and ligaments across outcomes. A key finding relating to potential graft tissue suitability was the comparable failure loads, UTS, CSAUS, sGAG, and hydroxyproline present between hamstring tendons (a standard graft source) and 5 tendons not typically used for grafting: fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus tendons.Conclusion: This study of lower limb tendons and ligaments has enabled direct comparison of morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical human tissue properties-key factors in the selection of suitable graft tissues. This analysis has identified 6 potential new donor tissues with properties comparable to currently used grafts.Clinical Relevance: This extensive data set reduces the need to utilize data from incompatible sources, which may aid surgical decisions (eg, evidence to expand the range of tendons considered suitable for use as grafts) and may provide congruent design inputs for new biomaterials and computational models. The complete data set has been provided to facilitate further investigations, with the capacity to expand the resource to include additional outcomes and tissues.",Web of Science,10.1177/03635465241260054,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
597,WS-221,Philippe et al. (2025),2025,Which tendon graft to choose for anatomical ligament reconstruction in chronic lateral ankle instability? A biomechanical study,"Background: The need for anatomic lateral ligament reconstruction of the ankle continues to grow. This procedure usually requires a gracilis autograft or in some cases an allograft. Siegler et al. reported the mechanical characteristics of the collateral lateral ligaments of the human ankle: 231 +/- 129 N for the ATFL and 307 +/- 142 N for the CFL. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanical properties of different tendon grafts available for ATFL and CFL reconstruction. We hypothesized that the properties of the tested grafts are not inferior to the published values of those of the original ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle. Methods: This was a comparative biomechanical study using 6 cadaver specimens (108 grafts): The biomechanical properties of nine types of grafts were determined using validated tensile testing methods: Gracilis, SemiT, EHL, FHL, Plantaris, Peroneus longus and brevis, TA and TP. The main outcome measure was the comparison of the mechanical properties of each single-stranded tendon with each other and with the known values for the ATFL and CFL, during a uniaxial static rupture test. Results: The mean load to failure for the gracilis was 257.5 +/- 52.9 N. The groups had similar mean values in terms of the maximum load that they could withstand before failing except for the plantaris (137.9 +/- 33.7 N) which was statistically lower than all other tested tendons (p < 0,01). The mean load to failure values of the grafts tested were equal or higher than that of the ATFL and CFL reported by Siegler et al. [14]: 231 +/- 129 N for the ATFL and 307 +/- 142 N for the CFL, while the grafts tested here had mean failure load between 258 +/- 53 N and 464 +/- 136 N. Conclusion: The gracilis, peroneus longus/brevis, EHL, FHL, TA, TP and semiT are legitimate grafts for combined ATFL and CFL reconstruction in the ankle. These tendons have mechanical properties (load to failure, maximum strain at failure and stiffness) that are equal to or higher than the native ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle, except the plantaris. Clinical relevance: This study validates the current use of the gracilis autograft for the anatomical reconstruction of the ATFL and CFL, and even provides proof that other tendons would be suitable for this anatomical reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligament by auto or even allograft under certain conditions.

598,WS-222,Yim et al. (2018),2018,Correlation between Mechanical Properties of the Ankle Muscles and Postural Sway during the Menstrual Cycle,"Ankle and foot injuries are common among athletes and physically active individuals. The most common residual disability, ankle sprain, is characterized by instability along with postural sway. If the supporting structures around a joint become lax, posture stability and balance are also affected. Previous studies have examined muscle stiffness and elasticity and postural sway separately; however, the relationship between these factors is yet unknown. It is well known that the levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen, change in women over the phase of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between the mechanical properties of tissue and balance activity using a non-invasive digital palpation device to determine if they undergo any changes over the menstrual cycle in young women. Sixteen young women with regular menstrual cycles completed the study. Tone, stiffness, and elasticity of the ankle muscles (lateral gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, and tibialis anterior) were measured using a non-invasive digital palpation device. Postural sway was recorded while the participants performed balance tasks during ovulation and menstruation. Significantly greater posture sway characteristics and ankle muscle elasticity were found during ovulation than during menstruation; lower tone and stiffness of the ankle muscles were observed at ovulation (p < 0.05). Additionally, weak-to-strong relationships between ankle muscle mechanical properties and postural sway characteristics were found (p < 0.05). These results suggest the effect of estrogen on human connective tissues. We therefore postulate that estrogen increases joint and muscle laxity and affects posture stability according to the phase of the menstrual cycle.",Web of Science,10.1620/tjem.244.201,TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
599,WS-223,Palmer et al. (2017),2017,A Biomechanical Comparison of Allograft Tendons for Ligament Reconstruction,"Background: Allograft tendons are frequently used for ligament reconstruction about the knee, but they entail availability and cost challenges. The identification of other tissues that demonstrate equivalent performance to preferred tendons would improve limitations. Hypothesis/Purpose: We compared the biomechanical properties of 4 soft tissue allograft tendons: tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), and semitendinosus (ST). We hypothesized that allograft properties would be similar when standardized by the looped diameter. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: This study consisted of 2 arms evaluating large and small looped-diameter grafts: experiment A consisted of TA, TP, and PL tendons (n = 47 each) with larger looped diameters of 9.0 to 9.5 mm, and experiment B consisted of TA, TP, PL, and ST tendons (n = 53 each) with smaller looped diameters of 7.0 to 7.5 mm. Each specimen underwent mechanical testing to measure the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile force (UTF), maximal elongation at failure, ultimate tensile stress (UTS), and ultimate tensile strain (UT epsilon). Results: Experiment A: No significant differences were noted among tendons for UTF, maximal elongation at failure, and UTE. UTS was significantly higher for the PL (54 MPa) compared with the TA (44 MPa) and TP (43 MPa) tendons. E was significantly higher for the PL (501 MPa) compared with the TP (416 MPa) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TP and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the TA tendons for all outcomes. Experiment B: All groups exhibited a similar E. UTF was again highest in the PL tendons (2294 N) but was significantly different from only the ST tendons (1915 N). UTE was significantly higher for the ST (0.22) compared with the TA (0.19) and TP (0.19) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TA, TP, and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the ST tendons. Conclusion: Compared with TA tendons, TP and PL tendons of a given looped diameter exhibited noninferior initial biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics. ST tendons were mostly similar to TA tendons but exhibited a significantly higher elongation/UTE and smaller cross-sectional area. For smaller looped-diameter grafts, all tissues were noninferior to ST tendons. In contrast to previous findings, PL tendons proved to be equally strong. Clinical Relevance: The results of this study should encourage surgeons to use these soft tissue allografts interchangeably, which is important as the number of ligament reconstructions performed with allografts continues to rise.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546516671944,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

(2016),2016,Increased Postural Sway and Changes in the Neuromuscular Activities of the Ankle Stabilizing Muscles at Ovulation in Healthy Young Women,"Lateral ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries among the physically active subjects. Ankle inversion-eversion laxity is greater and dynamic postural control is less in women compared with men. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in postural sway and its effects on the neuromuscular activities of the ankle stabilizing muscles during the menstrual cycle in young women. Fourteen young women with regular menstrual cycles participated in this experiment. Postural sway and electromyographic signals of the lateral gastrocnemius, peroneus longus (PL), and tibialis anterior (TA) were recorded while the participants performed eight different balance tasks at ovulation and early follicular phase during one full menstrual cycle. Significantly greater postural sway in the two most difficult balance tasks was observed at ovulation compared to that in the early follicular phase (p < 0.001). A similar pattern was also observed in terms of PL activity, while TA activity was significantly greater in the most difficult balance task at ovulation. In addition, TA-PL co-contraction (TA/PL ratio) was significantly higher at ovulation compared with that in the follicular phase in the two most difficult balance tasks (p < 0.01). Young women could benefit from increased understanding of the varying neuromuscular activation patterns throughout the menstrual cycle. The results of this study suggest that health professionals should be aware of the physiological effects and the shifts in neuromuscular strategies in each menstrual cycle phase in order to prevent increased risk of lower extremity injury.",Web of Science,10.1620/tjem.240.287,TOHOKU JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
601,WS-225,Delahunt et al. (2006),2006,Altered neuromuscular control and ankle joint kinematics during walking in subjects with functional instability of the ankle joint,"Background: The ankle joint requires very precise neuromuscular control during the transition from terminal swing to the early stance phase of the gait cycle. Altered ankle joint arthrokinematics and muscular activity have been cited as potential factors that may lead to an inversion sprain during the aforementioned time periods. However, to date, no study has investigated patterns of muscle activity and 3D joint kinematics simultaneously in a group of subjects with functional instability compared with a noninjured control group during these phases of the gait cycle. Purpose: To compare the patterns of lower limb 3D joint kinematics and electromyographic activity during treadmill walking in a group of subjects with functional instability with those observed in a control group. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Three-dimensional angular velocities and displacements of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, as well as surface electromyography of the rectus femoris, peroneus longus, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles, were recorded simultaneously while subjects walked on a treadmill at a velocity of 4 km/h. Results: Before heel strike, subjects with functional instability exhibited a decrease in vertical foot-floor clearance (12.62 vs 22.84 mm; P <.05), as well as exhibiting a more inverted position of the ankle joint before, at, and immediately after heel strike (1.69 degrees, 2.10 degrees, and -0.09 degrees vs -1.43 degrees, -1.43 degrees, and -2.78 degrees respectively [minus value = eversion]; P <.05) compared with controls. Subjects with functional instability were also observed to have an increase in peroneus longus integral electromyography during the post-heel strike time period (107.91% millisecond vs 64.53% millisecond ; P <.01). Conclusion: The altered kinematics observed in this study could explain the reason subjects with functional instability experience repeated episodes of ankle inversion injury in situations with only slight or no external provocation. It is hypothesized that the observed increase in peroneus longus activity may be the result of a change in preprogrammed feed-forward motor control.",Web of Science,10.1177/0363546506290989,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
602,WS-226,Arnout et al. (2013),2013,The influence of freezing on the tensile strength of tendon grafts : a biomechanical study,"We investigated the influence of freezing on the tensile strength of fresh frozen tendon grafts. The biomechanical characteristics of tendons that are less commonly used in knee surgery (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus and medial and lateral half of Achilles tendons) were compared to those of a semitendinosus and gracilis graft harvested from the same 10 multi-organ donors. All right side tendons constituted the study group and were frozen at -80 degrees C and thawed at room temperature 5 times. All left side tendons were frozen at -80 degrees C and thawed at room temperature once. There were 59 tendons in the control group and 56 in the study group. The looped grafts were clamped at one side using a custom-made freeze clamp and loaded until failure on an Instron 4505 testing machine. The average ultimate failure load was not significantly different between the control and the study group (p > 0.05). The failure load of the medial tendon Achilles was the lowest in both study and control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness between the control and study group (p > 0.05). From our study, we conclude that freezing tendons at -80 degrees C and thawing several times does not influence the maximum load, maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness. The medial half of the Achilles tendon is clearly the weakest tendon (p < 0.001). These findings show that tendon grafts can be frozen at -80 degrees C and thawed at room temperature several times without altering their biomechanical properties.",Web of Science,,ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA BELGICA

(2003),2003,A biomechanical comparison of three lower extremity tendons for ligamentous reconstruction about the knee,"Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate 3 previously unreported allograft tendons for use in knee surgery. These are the doubled tibialis anterior (TA), doubled tibialis posterior (TP), and doubled peroneus longus (PL) tendons. Type of Study: A biomechanical evaluation of the properties of the TA, TP, and PL. Methods: Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were used for testing. All specimens had the TA, TP, and PL tendons harvested. All specimens were tested in a custom-designed hydraulic testing machine using dry ice clamps. Each tendon was elongated at a rate of 1 mm/s. Load and displacement were recorded with an analog to digital interface board. Stiffness, modulus of elasticity, and stress and strain at failure were calculated. Results: The average tested lengths of the TA, TP, and PL were 37 cm (range, 13-68 cm), 33 cm (range, 7-74 cm), and 42 cm (range, 17-69 cm), respectively. The average cross-sectional areas of the doubled TA, TP, and PL were 38 mm(2) 48 mm(2), and 37 mm(2), respectively. The average failure loads for the doubled TA, TP, and PL tendons were 3,412 N, 3,391 N, and 2,483 N, respectively. The maximum stresses of the 3 tendons did not differ significantly (85-108 Mpa). The TA had the greatest stiffness (344 N/mm), followed by the TP (302 N/nim) and the PL (244 N/mm). Previous authors have documented the biomechanical strength of grafts for ACL reconstruction between 1,700 and 2,900 Newtons. The ultimate tensile strength and stiffness reported for the TA and TP grafts exceeded that for all previously reported grafts, including the doubled semitendinosus-gracilis. Conclusions: The TA, TP, and PL tendons showed excellent biomechanical properties when compared with historical data evaluating other graft sources. The biomechanical properties observed for the TA, TP, and PL were noted in specimens despite an average age of 78.3 years.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.arthro.2003.10.015,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY
604,WS-228,Kerkhoff et al. (2017),2017,Effects of two different foot orthoses on muscle activity in female during single-leg landing. A short-term and long-term study,"Foot orthoses are frequently used when treating knee pain, and their efficacy on pain reduction has been widely accepted. The effect of foot orthoses during gait has also been extensively investigated. However, their effect on neuromuscular control, especially during activities such as jumping, landing, or pivoting, is still unknown. This study investigated the effect of two different kinds of foot orthoses on lower limb's muscle activity during single-leg landings. In all, 28 female athletes were randomly assigned to either prefabricated soft bedding foot orthoses or custom-made sensorimotor foot orthoses and investigated immediately and again after 12 weeks of wearing the orthoses. The activity of each muscle was normalized to the overall activity of all analyzed muscles. This enables us to obtain the influence of the corresponding muscle on motor control. Muscle activity was analyzed during the flight and stabilization phases of landing. The sensorimotor foot orthoses increased the influence of peroneus longus and semitendinosus muscles and decreased the influence of tibialis anterior muscle, predominantly during the stabilization phase. Soft bedding foot orthoses, on the other hand, increased the influence of vastus medialis and decreased the influence of tibialis anterior muscle, mainly during the flight phase. Furthermore, motor control was altered during the flight and stabilization phases after long-term use, independently of the foot orthoses worn. In conclusion, sensorimotor foot orthoses may provide afferent feedback differently to soft bedding foot orthoses. Future clinical studies should investigate whether foot orthoses have positive effects on knee pain and the potential to reduce overload knee injuries during sports activities.",Web of Science,10.1007/s12662-017-0474-z,GERMAN JOURNAL OF EXERCISE AND SPORT RESEARCH
605,WS-229,Hashimoto et al. (2012),2012,Comparison of step-cut and Pulvertaft attachment for flexor tendon graft: a biomechanics evaluation in an in vitro canine model,"The purpose of this study was to compare two different methods of joining tendons of similar and dissimilar sizes between recipient and donor tendons for flexor tendon grafts. Flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and peroneus longus (PL) canine tendons were harvested and divided into four groups. The repair technique we compared was a step-cut (SC) suture and a Pulvertaft weave (PW). FDP tendons were significantly larger in diameter than PL tendons (p < 0.05). The volume of the SC repairs using either FDP or PL tendon as a graft was significantly smaller than PW repairs (p < 0.05). The ultimate load to failure and repair stiffness in FDP graft tendons significantly increased compared with the PL graft tendons (p < 0.05). The SC suture can be used as an alternative to the PW, with similar strength and less bulk for repairs using graft tendons of similar diameter. Surgeons should be aware of the effect of graft tendon size and repair method on strength and bulk when performing flexor tendon grafts.",Web of Science,10.1177/1753193412442460,JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-EUROPEAN VOLUME
606,WS-230,Eechaute et al. (2007),2007,Test-retest reliability of sudden ankle inversion measurements in subjects with healthy ankle joints,"Context. Sudden ankle inversion tests have been used to investigate whether the onset of peroneal muscle activity is delayed in patients with chronically unstable ankle joints. Before interpreting test results of latency times in patients with chronic ankle instability and healthy subjects, the reliability of these measures must be first demonstrated. Objective: To investigate the test-retest reliability of variables measured during a sudden ankle inversion movement in standing subjects with healthy ankle joints. Design: Validation study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: 15 subjects with healthy ankle joints (30 ankles). Intervention(s): Subjects stood on an ankle inversion platform with both feet tightly fixed to independently moveable trapdoors. An unexpected sudden ankle inversion of 50 degrees was imposed. Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured latency and motor response times and electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle, along with the time and angular position of the first and second decelerating moments, the mean and maximum inversion speed, and the total inversion time. Correlation coefficients and standard error of measurements were calculated. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.17 for the electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle (standard error of measurement = 2.7 milliseconds) to 0.89 for the maximum inversion speed (standard error of measurement = 34.8 milliseconds). Conclusions: The reliability of the latency and motor response times of the peroneus longus muscle, the time of the first and second decelerating moments, and the mean and maximum inversion speed was acceptable in subjects with healthy ankle joints and supports the investigation of the reliability of these measures in subjects with chronic ankle instability. The lower reliability of the electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle and the angular positions of both decelerating moments calls the use of these variables into question.",Web of Science,,JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING
607,WS-231,Su et al. (2016),2016,The association between MR T1? and T2 of cartilage and patient-reported outcomes after ACL injury and reconstruction,"Objective: To determine if cartilage T1 rho and T2 relaxation time measures after ACL injury and prior to reconstruction (baseline) are associated with patient-reported outcomes at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after surgery. Design: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1 rho and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1 rho or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1 rho or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. Results: Higher baseline SSD T1 rho posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1 rho pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year. Conclusion: T1 rho and T2 of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS after injury and both KOOS and Marx after reconstruction. Such associations may help clinicians stratify outcomes post-injury, and thus, improve patient management. (C) 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

(2023),2023,Reference intervals of complete blood count and coagulation tests in Vietnamese pregnant women,"BackgroundPregnancy has major effects that make hematology parameters outside of normal reference ranges. Therefore, we conducted this study to establish reference intervals for Vietnamese pregnant women.MethodsFrom June 2023 to Augst 2023, blood samples from 879 eligible pregnant women were run on DxH 900 hematology analyzer and ACL TOP 550 coagulation analyzer. The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference intervals.ResultsPT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count. The reference intervals for PT (seconds), APTT (seconds), fibrinogen (mg/dL), in the first trimester were 10.30-12.88, 25.40-35.46, 280.28-559.00, in the second trimester were 9.80-11.66, 24.05-33.23, 347.75-593.35, in the third trimester were 9.60-11.40, 23.40-31.80, 330.28-628.56, respectively. The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (x 109/L), RBC (x 1012/L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (x 109/L) in the first trimester were 6.33-15.24, 3.73-5.32, 10.33-13.95, 32.22-42.29, 169.66-413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99-15.55, 3.33-4.98, 9.71-13.17, 30.26-40.07, 172.34-372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22-14.14, 3.54-4.98, 9.80-13.97, 31.11-42.70, 151.30-417.14, respectively.ConclusionsMost established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.Trial registrationThis study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05929326.",Web of Science,10.1186/s12884-023-06106-2,BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH

(2025),2025,The correlation of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies with hematological parameters and clinical findings in sickle cell disease at steady state phase,"BackgroundCurrent therapeutic interventions for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) have improved patient survival; however, the clinical determinants of elevated autoantibody prevalence and related complications in patients with SCD remain insufficiently elucidated.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine the frequency of lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti- beta 2GPI) in patients with SCD at steady state phase to evaluate their possible correlations with hematological factors and clinical complications.MethodsThis cross-sectional study involving 92 SCD patients in a steady state phase was conducted. Blood specimens were obtained for complete blood count (CBC), in conjunction with the identification of IgG for aCL and anti-beta 2GPI utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the assessment of LA through the Diluted Russell Viper Venom Time (dRVVT).ResultsThe prevalence of LA, aCL, and anti-beta 2GPI (IgG) in SCD patients at steady state was 29.4%, 16.3%, and 5.4%, respectively. A correlation was found between LA and chronic leg ulcers, history of thrombosis, decreased platelet counts (PLT), and increased mean platelet volume (MPV) in SCD patients. Furthermore, aCL (IgG) exhibited a significant association with chronic leg ulcers, history of thrombosis, elevated Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, increased red blood cell count (RBC), and higher red cell distribution width (RDW) in SCD patients at steady state phase.ConclusionThis research elucidates the incidence of LA and aCL in SCD patients during steady state, linking these autoantibodies to hematological parameters and clinical complications; thus, prospective assessments of aPL in SCD patients are essential.",Web of Science,10.1186/s12959-025-00813-w,THROMBOSIS JOURNAL
610,WS-234,Farag¢ et al. (2020),2020,Evaluation of the Effect of Freezing and Gamma Irradiation on Different Types of Tendon Allografts by DIC Assisted Tensile Testing,"Featured Application The replacement of autografts with allografts from organ banks in ligament reconstruction is a hot topic in medicine. The demand for ACL allografts has increased in the last decade, and postoperative results are promising. This is visible in the increase in allograft use from 2% (between 1986 and 1996) to 14% (between 1996 and 2001), and it further increased around 2007 as its number reached 20-30% in the US. Orthopedic surgeons do not have to struggle with the problems of the donor site, size and the number of the grafts. In the case of multiple ligament reconstruction or ACL revision operations, the surgeons cannot remove enough tendons from the patients to replace the injured ligaments. Our work can help operating surgeons in the selection of proper allografts based on precise mechanical properties provided by our statistically evaluated measurements. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the endurance properties of four types of tendons caused by freezing and gamma irradiation. Four types of grafts were harvested: quadriceps, semitendinosus + gracilis, tibialis anterior, and peroneus longus. These were put into three groups: Group A was the control group, tested without freezing or irradiation. Grafts in Group B were frozen and irradiated (target dose: 21 kGy), while grafts in Group C were again frozen and irradiated (target dose: 42 kGy). Maximum load, tensile modulus, tensile strength, strain at maximum force and fracture strain were calculated from the force-elongation graphs of cyclic load tests. The higher gamma irradiation dose (Group C) significantly decreased the strains at tensile strength of the quadriceps tendons (p= 0.0004-0.0237), compared to the other two groups. In the case of the quadricep tendons (p= 0.0151), there is a significant decrease in Young's modulus after gamma irradiation with the dose of 42 kGy. According to the results of the study, the tibialis anterior and the peroneus longus are recommended in ACL reconstruction when gamma irradiation is required, while quadricep tendons, which are usually used for an autograph, are not suitable for allograft reconstruction after gamma irradiation from the viewpoint of mechanical properties.",Web of Science,10.3390/app10155369,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
611,WS-235,Martinek et al. (1998),1998,Combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament rupture - technique and results of arthroscopic assisted reconstruction,"Simultaneous ACL and PCL ruptures are rare but serious injuries resulting in distinct instability of the knee joint followed by an early degenerative arthritis. This combined trauma, which is often accompanied by additional ligament lesions, originates from a knee dislocation. While the conservative treatment of this complex instability is abandoned, the operative procedures are not yet standardised. The timing of the cruciate ligament reconstruction depends on the additional injuries, but generally the postprimary treatment is performed. Autografts and allografts, which can be also combined, are available for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments. The arthroscopic assisted operation starts with the drilling of all tibial and femoral tunnels using standard ACL and PCL arthroscopic instruments. The PCL is positioned after the graft has been transported into the joint through an anterolateral port, the ACL graft is positioned through the tibial drill hole and both are anchored first on the femoral and then on the tibial site i.e. with interference screws. In the postoperative rehabilitation neither immobilisation nor brace are used and progressive range of motion is allowed. The arthroscopic assisted reconstructions of the ACL and increasingly of the PCL are becoming standard procedures, but the technically difficult combined ACL/PCL reconstruction is restricted to a small number of arthroscopists. The first clinical results demonstrate, that the arthroscopic operation is comparable to the open reconstruction.",Web of Science,,ZENTRALBLATT FUR CHIRURGIE

(2023),2023,Different neuromuscular parameters are associated with knee abduction and hip adduction angles during functional tasks,"Knee abduction and hip adduction during functional tasks may indicate increased joint injury risk and discriminate between pathological and healthy people. Muscles' neuromuscular variables such as amplitude (EMGAMP) and onset (EMGONSET) have been used to explain kinematics. The study aimed to evaluate the correlation between two EMG variables of seven trunk and lower limb muscles and 3D kinematics during two tasks. Eighteen physically-active women participated in the study. The following variables were obtained during singleleg squat and anterior step-down: (i) EMGAMP and EMGONSET of fibularis longus (FL), tibialis anterior (TA), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), gluteus medius (GMED), ipsilateral (OB_IL) and contralateral (OB_CL) external obliques and (ii) knee abduction and hip adduction angular displacement (initial angle - angle at 60 degrees of knee flexion). Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between kinematic and EMG variables. Greater knee abduction was correlated with delayed TAONSET, GMEDONSET and OB_ILONSET during step-down. Greater hip adduction was correlated with lower VMAMP, BFAMP and delayed VMONSET during step-down. Although taskspecific, these results suggest that EMGONSET may influence knee abduction, while both EMGONSET and EMGAMP may affect hip adduction. The identification of muscle activation patterns in relation to kinematics may help the development of injury prevention and rehabilitation programs.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.jelekin.2023.102833,JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY
613,WS-237,Song et al. (2023),2023,Ant colony based fish crowding degree optimization algorithm for magnetic resonance imaging segmentation in sports knee joint injury assessment,"The aim was to analyse the application value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the injury evaluation of posterolateral corner (PLC) caused by sports, and the ant colony-based crowding degree of fish swarm optimization algorithm for image segmentation optimization of MRI images. The crowding degree of fish swarm was introduced to construct the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACOA), and the maximum and minimum ant system (MMAS) and ant colony algorithm based on variation features (VF-based ACA) were introduced to compare with ACOA. Besides, ACOA was applied to the MRI diagnosis of 98 patients with PLC injuries. Then the number of Degree I, Degree II, and Degree III in PLC patients were compared. The results showed that the iteration times and running time of the optimal solution were obtained by ACOA when the number of cities was 10, which were compared with those obtained by MMAS and VF-based ACA with no great differences (P > 0.05), and the iteration times and running time of ACOA were greater than those of MMAS and VF-based ACA when the number of cities was 50 (P < 0.05). There were 73 patients with PLC injuries involved 2 or more structures, 11 patients with PLC injuries only involved the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and 7 patients with PLC injuries only involved the popliteal tendon (PLT). The injury rates of LCL, medial collateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and PLT were 87.02%, 51.33%, 72.45%, 41.75%, and 84.06%, respectively. The number of patients with PLC injuries combined with Grade I of LCL, PCL, ACL, PCL, biceps femoris tendon, and PLT was higher than that of patients with Grade II and III (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ACOA was much better than MMAS and VF-based ACA in dealing with complex work, which effectively improved the ergodicity of search and reduced the running time. There were more common in PLC injuries combined with LCL, PCL, ACL, PCL, and PLT, MRI images based on ACOA could clearly show the degree of ligament and tendon injuries.",Web of Science,10.1111/exsy.12849,EXPERT SYSTEMS
614,WS-238,Picot et al. (2022),2022,Proprioceptive postural control strategies differ among non-injured athletes,"Postural control during complex tasks requires adequate sensory integration and somaesthetic reweighting: suboptimal postural strategies can lead to injury. We assessed the ability of healthy athletes to reweight somaesthetic signals during postural perturbations on different surfaces. Thirty-five young (16 +/- 1 years), healthy, elite handball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Proprioceptive reweighting was evaluated via vibration of the triceps surae and lumbar muscles on firm and foam surfaces. Postural variables and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius (GM), semitendinosus (ST) and fibularis longus (FL) were recorded during the PRE (10 s), VIBRATION (20 s) and POST (20 s) periods. Ankle proprioception was predominantly used on the firm compared to foam support. However, two opposing behaviours were observed: a rigid strategy in which reliance on ankle proprioception increased on the foam, and a plastic strategy that involved a proximal shift of proprioceptive reliance (p < 0.001). The plastic strategy was associated with a more effective recovery of balance after vibration cessation (p < 0.05). ST activation was higher during POST in the rigid strategy and did not return to the PRE level (p < 0.05) whereas it did in the plastic strategy. Proprioceptive strategies for postural control are highly variable and future studies should evaluate their contribution to injury.",Web of Science,10.1016/j.neulet.2021.136366,NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
615,WS-239,Sun et al. (2019),2019,Anti-GAPDH Autoantibody Is Associated with Increased Disease Activity and Intracranial Pressure in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"Objective. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune disease characterized by multiorgan involvement. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers. The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE. However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive. In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE. Methods. Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE. White blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (HB), platelet count (PLT), IgG, IgA, IgM, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), RF, anti-cardiolipin (Acl), ANA, AnuA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, 2-GPI, urinalysis, and 24h urine protein were measured by standard laboratory techniques. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index scores were evaluated accordingly. Results. The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (P=0.0011). Elevated serum anti-GAPDH was correlated with increased SLEDAI-2K (P=0.017), ESR, IgG, and IgM and associated with increased intracranial pressure and incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, but it was protective for seizure disorder incidence. Conclusions. Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity. It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice.",Web of Science,10.1155/2019/7430780,JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH
616,WS-240,Donath et al. (2015),2015,Does a Single Session of High-Intensity Interval Training Provoke a Transient Elevated Risk of Falling in Seniors and Adults?,"Background: Balance and strength training can reduce seniors' fall risk up to 50%. Available evidence suggests that acute bouts of neuromuscular and endurance exercise deteriorate postural control. High-intensity endurance training has been successfully applied in different populations. Thus, it seemed valuable to examine the acute effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on neuromuscular performance in seniors and young adults. Objective: The acute impact of a HIIT session on balance performance and muscle activity after exercise cessation and during post-exercise recovery was examined in young and old adults. We intended to investigate whether a transient exercise-induced fall-risk may occur in both groups. Methods: 20 healthy seniors (age 70 (SD 4) years) and young adults (age 27 (SD 3) years) were examined on 3 days. After exhaustive ramp-like treadmill testing in order to determine maximal heart rate (HR max) on the first day, either a 4 x 4 min HIIT at 90% of HR max or a control condition (CON) was randomly performed on the second and third day, respectively. Balance performance (postural sway) was assessed during single limb stance with open eyes (SLEO) and double limb stance with closed eyes (DLEC). EMG was recorded for the soleus (SOL), anterior tibialis (TIB), gastrocnemius (GM) and peroneus longus (PL) muscles at the dominant leg. All measures were collected before, immediately as well as 10, 30 and 45 min after HIIT and CON, respectively. Results: Compared to CON, HIIT induced significant increases of postural sway immediately after exercise cessation during SLEO in both groups (adults: p < 0.001, Delta = +25% sway; seniors: p = 0.007, Delta = +15% sway). Increased sway during DLEC was only found for seniors immediately and 10 min after HIIT (post: p = 0.003, Delta = +14% sway, 10 min post: p = 0.004, Delta = +18% sway). Muscle activity was increased during SLEO for TIB until 10 min post in seniors (0.008 < p < 0.03) and immediately after HIIT in adults (p < 0.001). Conclusion: HIIT training may cause an acute 'open-fall-window' with a transient impairment of balance performance for at least 10 min after exercise cessation in both groups. Occluded vision in seniors seems to prolong this period up to 30 min. Thus, the advantage of HIIT with regard to time efficiency seems debatable when considering transient HIIT-induced impairments of neuromuscular function. (C) 2014 S.

617,WS-241,Rosen et al. (2013),2013,Differences in Lateral Drop Jumps From an Unknown Height Among Individuals With Functional Ankle Instability,"Context: Functional ankle instability (FAI) is a debilitating condition that has been reported to occur after 20% to 50% of all ankle sprains. Landing from a jump is one common mechanism of ankle injury, yet few researchers have explored the role of visual cues and anticipatory muscle contractions, which may influence ankle stability, in lateral jumping maneuvers. Objective: To examine muscle-activation strategies between FAI and stable ankles under a lateral load and to evaluate the differences in muscle activation in participants with FAI and participants with stable ankles when they were unable to anticipate the onset of lateral loads during eyes-open versus eyes-closed conditions. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Controlled laboratory setting. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 40 people participated: 20 with FAI and 20 healthy, uninjured, sex-and age-matched persons (control group). Intervention(s): Participants performed a 2-legged lateral jump off a platform onto a force plate set to heights of 35 cm or 50 cm and then immediately jumped for maximal height. They performed jumps in 2 conditions (eyes open, eyes closed) and were unaware of the jump height when their eyes were closed. Main Outcome Measure(s): Amplitude normalized electromyographic (EMG) area (%), peak (%), and time to peak in the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles were measured. Results: Regardless of the eyes-open or eyes-closed condition, participants with FAI had less preparatory TA (t(158) = 2.22, P = .03) and PL (t(158) = 2.09, P = .04) EMG area and TA (t(158) = 2.45, P = .02) and PL (t(158) = 2.17, P = .03) peak EMG than control-group participants. Conclusions: By removing visual cues, unanticipated lateral joint loads occurred simultaneously with decreased muscle activity, which may reduce dynamic restraint capabilities in persons with FAI. Regardless of visual impairment and jump height, participants with FAI exhibited PL and TA inhibition, which may limit talonavicular stability and intensify lateral joint surface compression and pain.",Web of Science,10.4085/1062-6050-48.5.05,JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING

Design: Cross-sectional study Setting: Sports Performance and Research Center Participants: Twenty-two female soccer athletes from a Division III university (chronic ankle instability: n = 11; control: n = 11) Main outcome measures: Brain activity during a unilateral ankle movement functional magnetic resonance imaging task Results: Neuroimaging analyses revealed significant differences in sensorimotor brain activity, with greater activity in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex in the chronic ankle instability group compared to the control group (p = .039). Conclusions: Altered brain activity during unilateral ankle movements in athletes with chronic ankle instability could reflect disruptions in central nervous system processing. These preliminary findings offer a potential mechanistic target for rehabilitation strategies aimed at restoring central nervous system function and improving motor control in athletes with chronic ankle instability. ? 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2025.109988,Gait and Posture

(2026),2026,Platelet-derived exosomes delivering miR-25-3p inhibit ferroptosis by targeting P53 to attenuate osteoarthritis,"Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) ranks among the most prevalent degenerative joint disorders globally. However, current therapies primarily focus on symptom management, and their ability to effectively decelerate disease progression remains limited. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) in attenuating chondrocyte ferroptosis to delay OA progression. Methods: Plt-exos were isolated from human apheresis platelets and then characterized. The protective effects of Plt-exos on chondrocytes against IL-1?-induced ferroptosis were assessed through the detection of intracellular ferroptosis hallmarks and the expression levels of genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism and ferroptosis regulation in SW1353 cells. Key miRNAs in Plt-exos were identified, with miR-25-3p's role in chondrocyte ferroptosis and its interaction with P53 further investigated. Finally, the effect of Plt-exos-derived miR-25-3p on OA was validated in anterior cruciate ligament transection mice. Results: Plt-exos significantly reduced reactive oxygen species, Fe2+ and malonaldehyde levels, and downregulated ferroptosis drivers (P53, ALOX12), while enhancing glutathione and ferroptosis suppressors (SLC7A11, GPX4). Moreover, Plt-exos maintained ECM homeostasis by restoring COL2 and MMP13 expression. Notably, miR-25-3p was identified as a crucial mediator of these protective effects, as its inhibition reversed the benefits conferred by Plt-exos on ferroptosis. Furthermore, miR-25-3p directly targets the 3? UTR of P53, thereby suppressing its expression. In vivo studies revealed that Plt-exos administration improved cartilage preservation and subchondral bone remodeling in OA mice, with these effects being attenuated upon co-administration of antagomir-25-3p. Conclusion: Plt-exos effectively delay OA progression in vitro and in vivo though attenuating chondrocyte ferroptosis by targeting the miR-25-3p/P53 axis. Plt-exos may serve as innovative nanotherapeutics for OA management, offering significant prospects for clinical application. ? 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.cej.2025.171504,Chemical Engineering Journal

For the ankle, patellar tendon, calf medialis, calf lateralis, and tibialis anterior regions, the side-to-side temperature difference (?T) and the post-training change (?Post?Pre) were calculated. Results: On the first day, athletes with LAS injury history showed a marked increase in ?T at the ankle (+0.19ÿ?) and patellar tendon (+0.22ÿ?), whereas a decrease was observed in the control group. On the fourteenth day, ?T values were elevated from pre-training in the injury-history group and expanded toward the calf muscles (calf medialis +0.07ÿ?; calf lateralis +0.06ÿ?). Tibialis anterior exhibited a decrease in both groups. Conclusion: In football players with LAS injury history, thermal asymmetry that emerges acutely at the joint?tendon level with training load extends to the muscle level over two weeks. This pattern indicates lasting alterations in neuromuscular control and load distribution. AI-assisted thermography can sensitively reveal such asymmetries and may serve as a valuable tool for individualized load management and injury prevention strategies during return-to-play. ?

621,SC-4,Song et al. (2026),2026,Clinical efficacy of athletic taping-assisted physiotherapy for plantar fasciitis: A systematic evaluation and meta-analysis,"Background Plantar fasciitis is a common sports injury with long-term chronic pain in the heel as the main symptom, and athletic taping has achieved certain therapeutic effects to improve it, but the clinical efficacy of the problem is still controversial, which was evaluated by Meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the athletic taping technique on patients with plantar fasciitis. Methods The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and Vip databases were searched by computer for randomized controlled trial on the clinical efficacy of exercise taping in patients with PF from the time of construction to 1 September 2024, and the PRISMA 2020 checklist was strictly followed. Quality was assessed using the cochrane 2.0 randomized controlled trials scale by two independent reviewers. Endings were meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4.1 analysis software to analyse the data. Results Eleven randomized controlled trial with a total of 395 patients were included. On VAS scores, KT effectively reduced VAS pain scores (MD=-0.79,95 % CI ?1.10,-0.48, P < 0.00001); on AOFAS scores, KT improved AOFAS function scores (MD=6.58, 95 % CI 5.03,8.13, P < 0.00001) and the results remained consistent across intervention durations; on plantar fascia thickness measurements, KT significantly reduced plantar fascia thickness (MD=-0.33, 95 % CI ?0.56,-0.10, P = 0.005); on BBS scores, KT significantly improved BBS scores [MD= 4.75, 95 % CI (3.17, 6.32), P < 0.00001]; on FFI-FPS scores, KT effectively improved FFI-FPS scores [MD = -2.59, 95 % CI (-3.50, ?1.69), P < 0.00001]; on FFI-FDS scores, there was a significant improvement on FFI-FDS scores; on FFI-ALS scores, KT had a significant improvement on the FFI-ALS score had a significant effect [MD= -11.03, 95 % CI (-14.79, ?7.27), P < 0.00001]; and on VAS scores after follow-up, the pain relief effect was sustained (MD=-1.03, 95 % CI ?1.21, ?0.85, P < 0.00001). Conclusion Based on the available evidence, preliminary analyses suggest that KT combined with conventional rehabilitation may have some advantages in improving pain, ankle-hindfoot function, and plantar fascia thickness in patients with plantar fasciitis, and some of the efficacy is short-term sustained. However, due to the heterogeneity and sample size of the included studies, the above conclusions need to be further validated by more high-quality studies. ? 2025 European Foot and Ankle Society.",Scopus,10.1016/j.fas.2025.05.013,Foot and Ankle Surgery

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 60 patients with ACL rupture who met the inclusion criteria between August 2020 and July 2024. All patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using the autologous PLT grafts. Patients were assigned to group A [PLT stump sutured to peroneus brevis tendon (PBT), n=30] or group B (no stump intervention, n=30). The two groups showed no significant difference ( P>0.05) in baseline data, including gender, age, body mass index, injury mechanism, affected side, preoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, ankle muscle strength, ankle range of motion, and arch-related angles. Postoperative outcomes were assessed using the AOFAS score, ankle muscle strength (eversion and first-ray plantar flexion), arch-related angles (medial/lateral longitudinal and anterior/posterior arch), ankle range of motion (eversion, inversion, dorsiflexion, plantarflexion), and limb symmetry index (LSI). Change values in muscle strength, arch-related angles, and range of motion from preoperative to 12 months postoperatively were calculated for intergroup comparison. Results: Groups A and B had comparable PLT graft lengths and diameters ( P>0.05). All patients were followed up 13-16 months (mean, 14.5 months). Postoperative complications included 1 case of incision infection, 1 case of deep vein thrombosis, and 1 case of knee stiffness in group A, 1 case of knee stiffness in group B. There was no significant difference in the overall complication incidences between groups ( P>0.05). No significant difference was found in the AOFAS scores between different time points and between groups ( P>0.05). At 12 months after operation, neither group showed significant changes from preoperative baseline in ankle strength, range of motion, or arch-related angles, and there was no significant difference in these change values between groups ( P>0.05). There was no significant difference in LSI between the two groups at 6 or 12 months postoperatively ( P>0.05). Conclusion: Both suturing and leaving the PLT stump untreated during arthroscopic ACL reconstruction provided comparable ankle outcomes and well-preserved foot and ankle function.",Scopus,10.7507/1002-1892.202509008,Chinese Journal of Reparative and Reconstructive Surgery
623,SC-6,Soney et al. (2025),2025,Correlation between peroneus longus graft profile and anthropometric data in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ? An Indian scenario,"Aims and objectives: There are published literature regarding the correlation between Hamstring tendon (HT) graft profile and anthropometric data in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction from India; but not with Peroneus longus tendon (PLT). We hypothesise a positive correlation between the peroneus longus graft profile and few of patient's anthropometric variables. Materials and methods: Sixty eight patients who underwent Arthroscopic ACL Reconstruction using PLT graft were evaluated. Intraoperatively, tripled PLT graft length and diameter were correlated to the patient's age, height, weight, duration of injury, and BMI. Results: This study included 50 males and 18 females. Mean age was 29.2 ñ 8.3 years, mean height was 169.8 ñ 3.1 cm, mean weight was 78.4 ñ 4.5 kg, mean BMI was 26.4 ñ 0.1 kg/m2, mean duration of injury was 2.2 ñ 4.9 months, mean graft diameter was 8.9 ñ 0.6 mm and mean graft length was 8.5 ñ 0.8. Positive correlation with graft length and diameter was found only with height and weight (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Patient's height and weight, have a significant direct correlation with tripled PLT graft length and diameter. ? 2024 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.jorep.2024.100480,Journal of Orthopaedic Reports
624,SC-7,Lee et al. (2025),2025,Impact of tunnel enlargement on patient-reported outcomes following isolated posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Background: Tunnel enlargement (TE) might jeopardize knee function and ligament stability after revision surgery of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. To date, only few studies concern TE following posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR). This study aims to determine TE after isolated PCLR and its relationship with patient-reported outcomes. Methods: Patients who received primary isolated PCLR were screened. Femoral and tibial tunnel size was measured using an anteroposterior and lateral view of radiographs at least 6 months after surgery. TE is considered significant if the width of the bone tunnel increases by 25% over the drilled size. Patient-reported outcomes were determined using the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and the Lysholm score. The association between patient baseline characteristics, patient-reported scores, and the severity of TE was investigated. Results: Fifty-four patients were enrolled. TE was observed in 15 femoral tunnels and in 14 tibial tunnels. The average TE rate is 17.9% for femur and 7.9% for tibia. No correlation between the level of TE and patient-reported outcomes is noted. However, when patients are classified into TE and non-TE group on the basis of 25% of enlargement, those who exhibit femoral TE have a lower postoperative Lysholm score (81.1 ñ 13.0 vs. 90.5 ñ 12.3, P = 0.031) and those with tibial TE have a lower postoperative IKDC score (76.0 ñ 17.4 vs. 87.1 ñ 12.1, P = 0.031). Conclusions: The overall incidence of femoral and tibial TE after isolated PCLR is low. However, femoral and tibial TE are correlated with worse patient-reported outcomes in terms of the lower postoperative Lysholm and IKDC scores. ?

625,SC-8,Apaydin et al. (2025),2025,The vascular supply to the lateral compartment of the leg with emphasis on fibular flap harvesting,"Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the exact locations of vascular pedicles that supply the fibularis longus and brevis, to identify the morphometric features of those vessels in the lateral compartment of the leg, and to indicate the branching points of the pedicles from the main arteries. Methods: The popliteal arteries of 40 lower limbs from 20 adult cadavers (12 males, 8 females) were bilaterally injected with colored latex. After dissection, the branches of the arteries were identified and counted. The distances between the apex of the head of the fibula and the branching points of the anterior tibial, fibular, and posterior tibial arteries supplying the fibularis longus and brevis muscles were measured. Results: In all cases, a single artery coursing in the lateral compartment of the leg was identified; it was a branch of the anterior tibial artery and it supplied the proximal and middle thirds of the fibular muscles anteriorly. The mean distance between the origin of this artery and the apex of the fibular head was 8.65ÿcm. Its mean length was 10.9ÿcm and the mean number of its branches was 5.1. In all specimens, the fibular artery supplied the proximal and distal portions of the fibular muscles posteriorly. Conclusions: This study provides a detailed description of the morphometric properties and branching patterns of the axial pedicle of the anterior tibial artery, which runs longitudinally in the lateral compartment and supplies the fibularis longus and fibularis brevis muscles. We propose naming the pedicle of anterior tibial artery the lateral fibular artery. If this nomenclature is accepted, the fibular artery could be renamed the ?posterior fibular artery?. ?

626,SC-9,Luo et al. (2025),2025,Effects of modified reverse sural neurocutaneous flap repair on wound healing in patients with soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle,"Objective: The surgical team in this study examined the efficacy of a modified reverse sural neurocutaneous flap repair in treating soft tissue defects of the ankle and foot caused by accidents. Methods: This study enrolled 89 patients treated for soft tissue defects of the ankle or foot between January 2007 and December 2023. The patients were divided into two groups: 44 patients underwent a modified reverse sural neurocutaneous flap repair, while 45 received traditional treatment. The modified technique involved repairing various anatomical structures, including fascia, the saphenous nerve, the great saphenous vein, subcutaneous tissue, and skin, with flap sizes ranging from 14 to 152ÿcmý. In the traditional treatment group, the distal perforator of the peroneal artery was identified 5ÿcm above the lateral malleolus. Island fasciocutaneous flaps were designed along the sural nerve and lesser saphenous vein, elevated subfascially, rotated 180 degrees, and inset without tension. Donor sites were closed with grafts or direct sutures. Results: Of the 44 patients, who underwent the modified technique, 35 were male and 9 were female. Follow-up periods ranged from 2 to 24 weeks to monitor outcomes and recovery. The average size of the affected soft tissue was 71 cm2. Thirty-nine flaps survived completely, while three experienced partial necrosis and two had marginal necrosis. No cases of severe venous congestion were reported. The complication rate was lower with the modified method compared to the traditional repair (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The modified reverse neurocutaneous flap repair is a reliable and structured approach to treating soft tissue defects of the ankle and foot. This method has demonstrated favorable patient outcomes and presents a promising avenue for future studies and clinical practice. ?

627,SC-10,Butt et al. (2025),2025,5-years outcomes following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction comparing quadruple hamstring and peroneus longus tendon autografts: a randomized control trial,"Aims: This study presents clinical outcomes, functional results, and return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using quadruple hamstring tendon autograft or peroneus longus tendon autograft in a randomized controlled trial. Patients and methods: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6ÿmonths, 1, 2, and 5ÿyears after the surgery. At the 5ÿyear follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 ñ 0.4ÿmm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 ñ 0.2ÿmm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 ñ 3.9 (range = 85?100). Conclusion: Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.

628,SC-11,Almorish et al. (2025),2025,The correlation of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies with hematological parameters and clinical findings in sickle cell disease at steady state phase,"Background: Current therapeutic interventions for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) have improved patient survival; however, the clinical determinants of elevated autoantibody prevalence and related complications in patients with SCD remain insufficiently elucidated. Objective: This study aimed to examine the frequency of lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti- ?2GPI) in patients with SCD at steady state phase to evaluate their possible correlations with hematological factors and clinical complications. Methods: This cross-sectional study involving 92 SCD patients in a steady state phase was conducted. Blood specimens were obtained for complete blood count (CBC), in conjunction with the identification of IgG for aCL and anti-?2GPI utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the assessment of LA through the Diluted Russell Viper Venom Time (dRVVT). Results: The prevalence of LA, aCL, and anti-?2GPI (IgG) in SCD patients at steady state was 29.4%, 16.3%, and 5.4%, respectively. A correlation was found between LA and chronic leg ulcers, history of thrombosis, decreased platelet counts (PLT), and increased mean platelet volume (MPV) in SCD patients. Furthermore, aCL (IgG) exhibited a significant association with chronic leg ulcers, history of thrombosis, elevated Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, increased red blood cell count (RBC), and higher red cell distribution width (RDW) in SCD patients at steady state phase. Conclusion: This research elucidates the incidence of LA and aCL in SCD patients during steady state, linking these autoantibodies to hematological parameters and clinical complications; thus, prospective assessments of aPL in SCD patients are essential. ?

629,SC-12,Han et al. (2025),2025,Simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with valgus high tibial osteotomy improves mid- to long-term clinical outcomes without increasing the complication rates in young anterior cruciate ligament deficient patients with varus malalignment: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to systematically review and quantitatively analyze the mid- to long-term clinical outcomes of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and valgus high tibial osteotomy (HTO) in the treatment of ACL injury with varus malalignment of the knee. Methods: This study was performed in line with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) Guidelines. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies reporting clinical outcomes of simultaneous ACLR and valgus HTO surgery. Data on follow-up duration, patient-reported outcome measures, clinical stability assessment, radiological outcomes, return to sports level evaluation, and complication rate were extracted. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Study scores was used for quality assessment. Review Manager and R statistical software were used to perform the statistical analysis. Results: Fifteen studies with a total of 463 knees in 461 patients were included. Patients were predominantly male (75%). After mid- to long-term follow-up, the weighted mean of mechanical femoral tibial angle (mFTA) increased from 174.6ø to 182.0ø (weighted mean difference = ?7.4; p < 0.00001) after the simultaneous HTO and ACLR procedure. Significant improvements (p < 0.00001) were identified in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score (weighted mean: 51.8 vs. 69.7), Lysholm score (weighted mean: 59.8 vs. 87.3), and Tegner activity score (weighted mean: 3.5 vs. 4.8). The proportion of patients returned to pre-injury sports level ranged from 31.43% to 50% with an overall pooled rate of 31.8%. The incidence of complications ranged from 0% to 75% with an overall pooled risk of 13.4% (95% CI = 4.9%?25.2%). Two patients (0.46%) required revision surgery due to graft failure. Five studies compared the clinical outcomes of simultaneous valgus-producing HTO with ACLR and HTO alone procedures. The pooled analysis showed that the combined procedure group had a significantly higher Lysholm score (weighted mean: 72.4 vs. 78.7; WMD = ?6.3; p = 0.02). As for the radiological anterior tibial translation (ATT) measurement (weighted mean: 3.50 vs. 2.26, p = 0.19), the Kellgren-Lawrence OA grading score (weighted mean: 0.47 vs. 0.32, p = 0.12) and the incidence of complications (10/49 [20.4%] vs. 9/47 [19.1%]; OR = 0.71; P = 0.75), no significant difference between combined procedure group and HTO alone group were found. Conclusion: This review showed that the simultaneous ACLR with valgus HTO could achieve improvement of clinical outcomes in terms of PROMs, knee stability, and return to pre-injury level. The indication of this procedure is physically active ACL-D patients with knee varus resulting from medial compartment OA and/or medial meniscus insufficiency, rather than ACL injury with constitutional knee varus. Compared with HTO alone, the combined procedure improved knee function, but did not reduce the incidence of radiological OA progression or complication risk. Level of evidence: Level IV. ?

630,SC-13,Terada et al. (2025),2025,Prospective evaluation of spinal reflex excitability and perceived ankle instability following acute lateral ankle sprain in collegiate basketball players,"Background: The retrospective studies have reported altered spinal reflex excitability of the lower leg muscles in patients with acute lateral ankle sprain (LAS); however, these authors relied on data without a pre-injury assessment. Prospective examination of the longitudinal changes in neural excitability from pre-injury characteristics would provide a more comprehensive view of the underlying neuromuscular impairments. This study aimed to prospectively examine spinal reflex excitability of the fibularis longus and perceived ankle instability following acute LAS in collegiate basketball players. Methods: Using a prospective cohort study design, this study included 9 collegiate male basketball players who sprained their ankle during a competitive season and 26 those who were free from LAS during the season. All athletic patients were tested to assess spinal reflex excitability bilaterally of the fibularis longus and completed the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) prior to the beginning of the season (pre-injury), as well as at 24-hour, one-week, and one-month post-injury. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed by eliciting Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) and motor responses. The H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratio was calculated using the averaged values of maximum H-reflex and motor responses from the three recordings. Results: There were no significantly differences in the pre-injury H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratio of the fibularis longus between athletes who sustained LAS and those who did not (P > 0.05). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed poor diagnostic utility of the H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratio for predicting LAS (area under curve = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.33?0.70, P = 0.88). Additionally, no significant changes were observed in H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratios between baseline and post-injury time points (P > 0.05). However, a trend toward decreased spinal reflex excitability was observed on the injured side at 24ÿh post-injury compared to pre-injury levels. While this overall trend change did not reach statistical significance, the decreases observed in some individuals exceeded the established minimal detectable change (MDC) (0.03) for the H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratio of the fibularis longus. A significant time main effect was found for the CAIT scores (P = 0.03). Post-hoc analyses revealed significantly lower CAIT scores at 24ÿh (P = 0.03) and one week (P = 0.02) post-injury compared to baseline. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the pre-injury H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratio of the fibularis longus may be not a reliable predictor for LAS in collegiate basketball players and is not consistently altered following acute injury. However, some individuals demonstrated a decrease in the post-injury H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratio of the fibularis longus exceeding the MDC, suggesting clinically meaningful changes. Additionally, basketball players reported significantly lower CAIT scores within the first week post-injury, indicating early perceived ankle instability. These findings highlight the importance of considering both group and individual-level responses in the assessment of LAS. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to explore longitudinal changes in spinal reflex excitability and their potential role in injury recovery and prevention. ?

631,SC-14,Wen et al. (2025),2025,Effects of foot rotation on ankle control and injury risk during badminton lunge landings,"Background: The badminton lunge is a decisive yet injury-prone action that places substantial loads on the ankle, and toe-in, neutral, or toe-out orientations may alter joint mechanics and influence injury risk; however, evidence in sport-specific lunge contexts is scarce. This study quantified the biomechanical effects of different toe-orientations in badminton lunge landings using integrated motion capture, force measurement, electromyography, and finite element modeling. By uniquely combining EMG and FEA, the study provides evidence-based guidance for performance optimization and injury prevention. Methods: Thirty male amateur badminton players performed right-lunge landings under three toe-orientations. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using motion capture and force platforms. Muscle activation was assessed through surface electromyography and musculoskeletal modeling. A three-dimensional finite element model of the foot simulated Von Mises stress distribution. Statistical analyses included repeated measures ANOVA and statistical parametric mapping. Results: Toe-out landings significantly reduced ankle eversion angles, eversion moments, anterior-posterior shear forces, and joint impulse (p < 0.001, p = 0.025, p = 0.047, p = 0.038). They also promoted smoother power output and greater anteroposterior center-of-mass displacement. Stress shifted from the rearfoot to the forefoot, accompanied by increased activation of the peroneal muscles and triceps surae. In contrast, toe-in landings produced higher eversion loading, stress concentration in the rearfoot, greater tibialis anterior activation, and restricted center-of-mass displacement. Conclusion: Toe-out positioning lowered ankle load and rearfoot stress, improved stabilizing muscle activation and shock absorption, and facilitated center-of-mass control. Toe-in positioning elevated stress concentration and injury risk. Moderate toe-out angles were recommended to optimize footwork efficiency and protect joint health. ?

632,SC-15,Hsueh et al. (2025),2025,Comparative outcomes of different achilles stump management after flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer,"Various surgical techniques for reconstruction of chronic Achilles tendinosis have been developed, including free semitendinosus tendon autograft and allograft for larger Achilles tendon defects. Flexor hallucis longus (FHL) transfer has emerged as an effective treatment option for patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy (IAT). During FHL transfer, FHL tendon is harvested at its distal part and rerouted to augment or replace the diseased portion of the Achilles tendon, providing improved structural integrity and function, but the necessity of reattachment of the Achilles stump in FHL transfer remains controversial. Patients who underwent FHL transfer surgery for IAT between 2013 and 2022 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Evaluating parameters included clinical evaluations, complications, a satisfaction questionnaire, preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) as well as outcomes scores including American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS), Foot Function Index (FFI). Furthermore, active range of motion (AROM) and torque of strength in both plantarflexion(PF) and dorsiflexion(DF) for both healthy and operated ankles of all patients were measured. The follow-up time was more than 12 months for all patients. A total of twenty-nine patients, with a median age of 63.0 years old and an average follow-up time of 28.1 months were enrolled. Thirteen patients were assigned to the Non-attached group and sixteen patients were assigned to the Reattached group. The functional outcomes such as AOFAS, ATRS, FFI, and VAS scores, as well as ankle strength in both groups were significantly improved after surgeries. However, no significant differences between groups in preoperative and postoperative VAS scores and functional outcomes were found. AROM and ankle torque were comparable, except for less plantarflexion torque loss at 30ø/sec in the reattached group (p = 0.046). All evaluating parameters significantly improved without notable complications in patients after FHL transfer surgery whether with or without reattachment. There were no significant differences in the improvement of most parameters among subgroups. While reattachment of the Achilles tendon stump to the FHL transfer for IAT may not be crucial for superior outcomes, the torque improvement seen in the reattached group indicates possible advantages that require additional investigation. ?

Method and materials: Forty-three New Zealand rabbit knee joints were used in the study. Rabbits were divided into five groups: Tendon autograft-microfracture, Tendon autograft, Microfracture, Empty defect (Sham) group, and Intact group. After creating a full-thickness cartilage defect in the right knee medial femoral condyle of the rabbits, the treatment methods belonging to the groups were applied. At the end of the six-week follow-up period, macroscopic and microscopic evaluations were made. Regenerative processes were evaluated by means of stereological, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic techniques on the sections obtained from paraffin and resin blocks. Newly formed cartilage and connective tissue volumes were analyzed with volume fraction. Results: In rabbits that received a tendon autograft, a smooth surface and a cartilage surface compatible with the surrounding tissue were observed, while a fibrous and defective healing was observed in the microfracture group. In the empty defect (Sham) group, healing was minimal. In immunohistochemical analyses, higher cartilage matrix formation and type II collagen structure were detected in the tendon autograft groups. In scanning electron microscopic evaluation, healthy isogenous groups were observed in the group that received tendon autograft and microfracture treatment. Conclusion: The use of tendon autograft allows chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation as a cytoskeleton, providing a better regeneration more like healthy cartilage tissue. ?

634,SC-17,Wang et al. (2025),2025,"Can isokinetic muscle strength training with hip abduction and adduction improve muscle strength, balance, and gait in patients with functional ankle instability? A randomized controlled trial","Background: Previous studies have confirmed that patients with functional ankle instability (FAI) have inadequate hip abductor muscle strength. Muscle strength training is a commonly used intervention in people with FAI. The effects investigated by previous studies have shown conflicting results. However, whether hip adduction and abduction isokinetic muscle strength training can improve muscle strength, balance, and gait in patients with FAI remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to observe whether muscle strength, balance, Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) score, plantar pressure, and gait can be improved in patients with FAI via isokinetic muscle strength training of the peri-ankle muscle groups combined with hip abduction and adductor muscle groups. Participants: FAI (n=70). Interventions: The 70 FAI patients were randomly divided into an ankle isokinetic strength training (AIT) group and a hip isokinetic strength training (HIT) group. The AIT group underwent inversion/eversion and dorsiflexion/plantar flexion isokinetic concentric strength training; the HIT group underwent hip abduction and abduction isokinetic strength training based on ankle isokinetic strength training for six weeks. Main outcome measures: Before and after training, isokinetic concentric force tests around the ankle and hip adduction and abduction, the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and plantar pressure and gait assessments were performed. Results: After 6 weeks of training, significant changes in muscle strength were observed in ankle inversion, eversion, dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and abduction for both the AIT and HIT groups (Group*Time, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the HIT group exhibited greater increases in muscle strength compared to the AIT group (Group, P < 0.05). Additionally, both groups showed varying degrees of improvement in dynamic balance, CAIT scores, and gait patterns (Time, P < 0.05), with the HIT group demonstrating superior improvement compared to the AIT group (Group, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Isokinetic strength training through the peri-ankle muscles combined with the hip adductor and abductor muscles was more effective than peri-ankle strength training alone in improving muscle strength, balance, plantar pressure, gait, and self-reported scores in FAI patients. Trial registration: This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial and has been registered in the China Clinical Trial Registry on 07/04/2022 with registration number ChiCTR2200058341. ?

635,SC-18,Zhu et al. (2025),2025,Toe-out landing reduces anterior talofibular ligament strain while maintains calcaneofibular ligament strain in people with chronic ankle instability,"Background: The anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) and the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) are vulnerable to be torn or ruptured during lateral ankle sprain (LAS), especially in people with chronic ankle instability (CAI). This study aims to determine whether landing with a larger toe-out angle would influence ATFL and CFL strains in people with CAI, aiming to contribute to the development of effective landing strategies to reduce LAS risk. Methods: Thirty participants with CAI (22 males and 8 females, age: 21.2 ñ 1.2 years, height: 176.9 ñ 9.0 cm, body mass: 70.6 ñ 12.1 kg, mean ñ SD) were recruited. Each participant landed on a specialized trap-door device with their unaffected limbs on a support platform and their affected limbs on a movable platform, which could be flipped 24ø inward and 15ø forward to mimic LAS conditions. Two landing conditions were tested?i.e., natural landing (NL, with natural toe-out angle at landing) and toe-out landing (TL, with toe-out angle increased to over 150% of that under the NL conditions). Kinematic data were captured using a 12-camera motion analysis system, and ATFL and CFL strains were calculated using a 3D rigid-body foot model. Paired sample t tests and Pearson's correlations were used to analyze data. Results: Compared to NL conditions, ATFL strain decreased (p < 0.001, d = 2.42) while CFL strain remained unchanged (p = 0.229, d = 0.09) under TL conditions. The toe-out angle was negatively and strongly correlated with ATFL strain (r = ?0.743, p < 0.001) but not with CFL strain (r = 0.153, p = 0.251). Compared to NL conditions, participants exhibit a lower ankle inversion angle (p < 0.001, d = 0.494), a higher plantarflexion angle (p < 0.001, d = 1.101), and no significant difference in external rotation angle (p = 0.571, d = 0.133) under TL conditions. Conclusion: Toe-out landing may reduce ATFL strain while maintaining CFL strain in people with CAI, thereby reducing the risk of LAS. ? 2025",Scopus,10.1016/j.jshs.2025.101035,Journal of Sport and Health Science
636,SC-19,Sung et al. (2025),2025,Impact of ankle injuries on joint range of motion and muscle viscoelasticity in female amateur volleyball athletes,"Introduction: This study aimed to compare ankle joint range of motion (ROM) and muscle viscoelastic properties in female amateur volleyball players with a history of ankle sprain (AS group) and without (non-AS group). Methods: Forty-one female participants were included in the study: 25 in the AS group and 16 in the non-AS group. Ankle ROM was measured for inversion (IV), eversion (EV), plantar flexion (PF), and dorsiflexion (DF). Viscoelastic properties were assessed in the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and peroneus longus (PL) muscles. Results: A significant difference in DF ROM was observed between the AS and non-AS groups (p = 0.030). Muscle frequency was significantly higher for TA (p = 0.010), MG (p = 0.008), and LG (p = 0.008) in the AS group. Additionally, muscle stiffness in TA (p = 0.010), MG (p = 0.014), LG (p = 0.021), and PL (p = 0.049) was significantly greater in the AS group. Significant differences in relaxation were found in TA (p = 0.010) and PL (p = 0.032), while creep differences were noted in TA (p = 0.007). Conclusions: These findings suggest that ankle sprain may lead to persistent alterations in muscle mechanical properties and joint mobility, highlighting the importance of comprehensive assessment and targeted rehabilitation of all related muscles to prevent recurrent injuries and optimize recovery in female volleyball players. ?

637,SC-20,Clarrybel et al. (2025),2025,Morphometric study of fibularis muscles and its motor entry points with its clinical significance: a cadaveric study,"Background: The fibularis longus and fibularis brevis muscle flap are commonly used to repair small- to medium-sized soft-tissue defects of the lower leg and foot. So, this study was conducted to study the morphometry of fibularis muscles and to examine the motor entry points and the branching points of the superficial peroneal nerve which innervate these muscles. Methods: In this study 55 lower limbs were dissected to expose fibularis longus, and fibularis brevis muscles and various measurements were taken. Additionally, the motor entry point along with the branching points of the superficial peroneal nerve was also noted down. Results: On comparing parameters of right leg fibularis longus between male and female it was seen that leg length and main tendon length was significant as their p values were 0.020 and 0.049. On comparing parameters of left leg fibularis longus between male and female it was seen that only muscle length was significant as its p values was 0.004. There were 2 and 3 motor entry points noted in fibularis longus and brevis. Conclusions: The findings of this study will help the surgeons in grafting and reconstruction in foot and ankle surgery, in surgeries to maintain the arches of the foot. The location of motor entry point is also very important because it will help the surgeons where to inject phenol or other agents for blocking the nerve in cases of a spastic lower extremity.

638,SC-21,Peng et al. (2025),2025,Superior fulcrum reconstruction improve tendon-to-bone healing in irreparable massive rotator cuff tears compared with superior capsule reconstruction,"Recently, superior capsule reconstruction (SCR) has achieved some results in the treatment of irreparable massive rotator cuff tears (IMRCT), but the incidence of various postoperative complications is high. The study aims to establish a model of IMRCT in rabbits, and compare the histomorphology and molecular biology differences between superior fulcrum reconstruction (SFR) and SCR, so as to provide a new and effective treatment method for the clinical treatment of IMRCT. Thirty-six mature New Zealand white rabbits were required for the experiment to build the model of IMRCT. The supraspinatus and subscapular muscle of the thirty-six rabbits were cut off and randomly divided into two groups of eighteen rabbits in each group, with SFR and SCR. Six rabbits in each group were sacrificed at 4, 8, and 12ÿweeks after surgery for histological and molecular assessment. Macroscopically, no retear occurred in SFR group and SCR group after surgery. The results of molecular biological showed that the expression levels of COL1, BMP2, SCX and SOX9 in the SFR group were significantly higher than those in the SCR group at 4 and 8ÿweeks (P < 0.05), while the expression of COL3 was lower than that in the SCR group. There was no significant difference in the expression of Aggrecan between the two groups at 4ÿweeks (P > 0.05). At 12ÿweeks after surgery, the expression levels of COL1, BMP2 and Aggrecan in the SFR group were significantly higher than those in the SCR group (P < 0.05), while COL3, SCX and SOX9 were not significantly difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Histologically, collagen fiber maturity and fibrocartilage regeneration in the SFR group were superior to those in the SCR group at 8 and 12ÿweeks (P < 0.05). However, at 4ÿweeks, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). In an IMRCT rabbit model, healing processes of SFR and SCR are different, but both repair techniques were effective. SFR outperformed SCR in collagen fiber maturity, fibrocartilage regeneration, and tendon regeneration. ? The Author(s) 2025.",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-025-09329-9,Scientific Reports
639,SC-22,Kazemi Pakdel et al. (2025),2025,Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the short version of anterior cruciate ligament return to sport after injury scale to Persian Language,"Background: Many athletes who have anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) surgery strive to resume their sport at the level they played before the injury. The purpose of this study was to analyze the short Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury scale (ACL-RSI) version?s cultural adaptation and validity to Persian language. Methods: To evaluate test?retest reliability, 140 participants completed the Persian short version of the ACL-RSI twice, with a 7- to 10-day interval between assessments. Also, Internal consistency, and construct validity were assessed. Results: The findings indicate that the measure demonstrates excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.92 [0.86 ? 0.95]) and strong internal consistency (Cronbach?s alpha = 0.91). Also, the standard error of measurement and minimum detectable change were determined to be 5.11 and 10.69, respectively. The Persian short version of the ACL-RSI exhibited a strong correlation with the ACL-RSI (P <.001, r =.77), a moderate correlation with the Injury Psychological Readiness to Return to Sport Questionnaire (I-PRRS) (P =.03, r =.51) and a strong negative correlation with the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TKS) (P <.001, r = ?.73). Additionally, this short version of the ACL-RSI demonstrated a strong correlation with the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) (P <.001, r =.68) and with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales (P <.001, r =.61?0.69). Conclusion: The Persian short version of the ACL-RSI is recommended as a reliable and valid tool for assessing psychological readiness for athletes returning to sport following ACL-R.

(2025),2025,"Single-Bundle Autografts Outperform Single-Bundle Achilles Allograft in Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Terms of Posterior Tibial Translation and Clinical Outcomes, but No Differences Exist Between Double-Bundle Grafts: A Network Meta-analysis","Background: The optimal graft choice for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) remains controversial. Purpose: To evaluate and compare the biomechanical and clinical outcomes, as well as the complication and failure rates, associated with the use of Achilles allografts; hamstring tendon (HST), quadriceps tendon (QT), and bone?patellar tendon?bone (BTB) autografts; and hybrid (HY) grafts in PCLR. Study Design: Network meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to evaluate the use of various graft types in isolation for PCLR. Outcomes assessed included posterior tibial translation (PTT) at 90ø, side-to-side PTT differences, Lysholm and Tegner scores, complication rates, and failure rates. Separate analyses compared single-bundle (SB) and double-bundle (DB) techniques within the Achilles, HST, and HY grafts, including different combinations for DB reconstruction. Results: A total of 53 studies involving 1861 patients met the inclusion criteria. Graft distribution was as follows: SB Achilles allograft (n = 328), DB Achilles allograft (n = 234), SB HST autograft (n = 646), DB HST autograft (n = 153), SB BTB autograft (n = 111), SB QT autograft (n = 122), and HY grafts (n = 267). Among SB grafts, SB HST exhibited the lowest PTT and highest Lysholm scores, whereas SB Achilles had the highest PTT and lowest clinical scores (P < .001). No significant differences were found between SB autografts (P = .08) or among the DB Achilles, HST, and HY grafts (P = .72). No significant difference in failure rates was observed between the DB graft groups (P = .16). Logistic regression demonstrated that relative to SB BTB, SB Achilles had the highest odds of failure (7.92), followed by SB HST (2.89) and SB QT (1.72). Combined multiligament reconstructions exhibited less PTT than isolated PCLR. Conclusion: SB autografts outperformed SB Achilles allograft in terms of PTT, and SB BTB had the lowest failure rates, while SB HST had the highest Lysholm scores. DB PCLR demonstrated superior biomechanical outcomes compared with SB reconstruction, regardless of the type of grafts used. All graft groups demonstrated a clinically significant improvement, exceeding the previously established minimal clinically important difference in the Lysholm and Tegner scores. ? 2025 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1177/03635465251327675,American Journal of Sports Medicine
641,SC-24,Lee et al. (2025),2025,"Comparison of clinical, radiological, and second-look arthroscopic outcomes between hamstring autograft and tibialis allograft following remnant-tensioning anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","Background: The remnant-tensioning (RT) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has been reported to have excellent postoperative outcomes. However, the influence of graft selection on postoperative outcomes of autografts and allografts after RT-ACLR has been poorly investigated. The purpose of our study was to compare the clinical, radiological, and second-look arthroscopic outcomes of autografts and allografts following RT-ACLR. Methods: Between January 2013 and May 2020, 94 and 64 patients were enrolled in auto (hamstring tendon) and allo (tibialis tendon) groups, respectively. For subgroup analysis, patients were divided into two age categories: ó34 and > 34 years of age. Stability tests, including the Lachman and Pivot shift tests, side-to-side differences on Telos stress radiographs and KT-2000 arthrometer, patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs), and graft status on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and second-look arthroscopy, were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Results: The two groups showed no statistically significant differences in stability outcomes or PROMs for patients aged ó 34 and > 34 years. Furthermore, both groups demonstrated comparable postoperative graft status on postoperative MRI and second-look arthroscopy analyses in patients aged ó 34 and > 34 years. Conclusion: RT-ACLR using allografts yielded similar postoperative clinical outcomes, MRI findings, and second-look results compared to autografts, irrespective of patients? age. Therefore, allografts may serve as a viable option for patients scheduled for RT-ACLR. ?

642,SC-25,Tian et al. (2025),2025,Biomechanical comparison of three tibial tunnel positions for PCL reconstruction: a 3D finite element analysis,"Purpose: To compare the biomechanical properties of the graft during PCL reconstruction by three-dimensional finite element analysis of the PCL trans-tibial reconstruction technique with three different tibial bony channel exit positioning points, to determine which method of positioning is better able to avoid wear and tear between the graft and bony channel, and to reduce the failure rate of the PCL reconstruction. Methods: This is a study limited to computational simulation and based on data from a single anatomical model. Thirty-year-old male volunteers were selected. A three-dimensional knee joint model consisting of the distal femur, the proximal tibiofibula and the posterior cruciate ligament was established based on CT scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction of the left knee joint. According to the different positioning points of the tibial tunnel exit, the PCL model of tibial side PCL anatomical region center point reconstruction, the PCL model of Fanelli suggested point (i.e., 10ÿmm below and 5ÿmm lateral to the PCL anatomical point) reconstruction, and the PCL model of tibial side posterior posterior joint capsule distal anticompromise and posterior mediastinum reference positioning point (i.e., 5ÿmm above the posterior capsule distal retropubic, 5ÿmm medial to the posterior mediastinum) reconstruction were established (respectively designated as Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3). The diameter of the entire graft was set uniformly at 7ÿmm. With the knee flexed at 90ø and the midpoint of the line connecting the medial and lateral apexes of the tibial intercondylar ridge as the reference point, a standardized backward thrust displacement of 5ÿmm was applied to simulate a posterior knee drawer test with all proximal femoral degrees of freedom constrained. The model overall Mises stress, tibial plateau Mises stress, PCL Mises stress, PCL contact Cpress stress, PCL contact stress and PCL contact effective area were measured. Results: Simulated posterior drawer tests demonstrated that Model 3 exhibited a substantial reduction in PCL contact Cpress stress (22.57ÿMPa) compared to Model 1 (32.93ÿMPa) and Model 2 (29.86ÿMPa). Additionally, the ratio of contact force (277.48ÿN) to effective graft-tibial contact area (50.19ÿmmý), representing the contact force per unit area, was also the lowest in Model 3 compared to Model 1 (213.88ÿN/17.65ÿmmý) and Model 2 (470.77ÿN/63.75ÿmmý). These findings indicate that Model 3 significantly reduced frictional loads between the graft and tibia, highlighting its biomechanical optimization potential. Further analysis revealed that Model 3 also displayed the lowest tibial plateau Mises stress (48.80ÿMPa). However, its PCL tensile stress (69.71ÿMPa) was significantly higher than that of Model 1 (41.03ÿMPa) and Model 2 (40.90ÿMPa), suggesting that while Model 3 minimizes friction dependency, it primarily transfers loads through graft tension. Conclusion: Compared with the anatomic regional center point and Fanelli point reconstruction PCL, the grafts of the soft tissue reference tibial localization reconstruction PCL method were subjected to greater tensile forces, but they had significantly lower friction with the tibia and were able to reduce contact wear with the tibia. This can enhance long-term patient outcomes. Our study offers crucial biomechanical evidence for optimizing tunnel positioning in PCL reconstruction, propelling the advancement of surgical techniques. ?

643,SC-26,Chia et al. (2025),2025,A cross-sectional study on peroneal muscle echogenicity changes and their effects on balance functions in individuals with chronic ankle instability,"This study investigated the relationship between peroneal muscle echogenicity and balance function in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). While prior research has examined peroneal muscle activity, reaction time, and balance, the impact of echogenicity?an indicator of myosteatosis/fibrosis?remained underexplored. Cross-sectional study. Sixty-two adults with CAI were included. Peroneal muscle size, echogenicity, and stiffness were assessed using ultrasound. Dynamic balance was evaluated via the Y balance test (YBT), and static postural control was evaluated during lateral step-down (LSDT) and single-leg stance test (SLST). Eversion strength was assessed with a dynamometer. The relationship between muscle characteristics and balance was assessed using canonical correlation and stepwise linear regression. Individuals with increased peroneal muscle echogenicity had reduced muscle size, poorer eversion strength, and poorer balance. Eversion strength is positively associated with YBT scores across all echogenicity levels and negatively associated with posture parameters during the LSDT in moderate echogenicity. Peroneal longus stiffness was positively associated with YBT in severe echogenicity and posture parameters during the SLST. Increased peroneal muscle echogenicity is associated with poorer eversion strength and stiffness, resulting in poorer balance performance. Improving the peroneal muscle quality may enhance functions in the CAI condition. ? The Author(s) 2025.",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-025-00175-3,Scientific Reports
644,SC-27,Chen et al. (2025),2025,Comparative efficacy of different lengths of anterior cruciate ligament stump during reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury affects individuals, and successful ACL helps patients return to an active lifestyle. This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length ò 1/2 and < 1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). Methods: A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump ò 1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump < 1/2) groups (n = 17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. Results: In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p < 0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p > 0.05). Conclusion: During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length ò 1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length < 1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint. ?

645,SC-28,Zhang et al. (2025),2025,Association between lower extremity movement patterns and ACL loading in CAI patients across varied ankle sprain frequencies within a year,"Purpose: To investigate the relationship between the biomechanical characteristics of lower extremity and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) loading during single-leg landing in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI) who have different ankle sprain frequencies within a year. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The incidence of ankle sprains among 74 male participants was meticulously documented over a one-year period. The participants had an average age of 21.78 years, a height of 176.37ÿcm, and a weight of 72.61ÿkg. Subsequently, a one-year monitoring period was implemented to assess the incidence of ankle sprains among the participants. The participants were classified into five groups according to their documented frequency of ankle sprains. The categories were as follows: The 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 or more ankle sprain groups. Kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic data were collected while participants performed a single-leg landing task. Lower extremity muscle force and ACL loading were modeled using OpenSim software. Results: CAI patients with more than four ankle sprains had higher peak ACL loading during single-leg landing than those with only two or three ankle sprains (P < 0.05). Additionally, CAI patients with more than four ankle sprains exhibited a limited range of ankle dorsiflexion and biceps femoris muscle force, which was significantly correlated with ACL loading (P < 0.05). CAI patients with more than 5 ankle sprains had greater ankle inversion angle, inversion angular velocity, vertical ground reaction force (GRF), rectus femoris muscle strength, and lower gastrocnemius, soleus muscle force during single-leg landing, and these biomechanical indices were significantly correlated with ACL strain (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Based on these findings, it appears that experiencing four ankle sprains within a year might be a threshold for the development of knee compensation in CAI patients. This compensation could result in a significant increase in ACL loading. The study also found that CAI patients with more than four ankle sprains commonly exhibited altered motor characteristics such as limited ankle dorsiflexion angle, increased ankle inversion angle, excessive vertical GRF, and insufficient gastrocnemius and soleus muscle force during the landing phase. These characteristics might be responsible for the observed increase in ACL loading. In the future, clinical practice and scientific research may benefit from targeted interventions to prevent ACL injuries in CAI patients with different sprain histories, in accordance with the findings of this study. ?

646,SC-29,Yu et al. (2025),2025,Knotted single lasso loop has a lower stiffness and comparable ultimate failure strength compared with knotless whipstitch fixation in onlay tenodesis,"Background: Suture and knotless anchor onlay tenodesis are two common treatments for biceps lesions; however, there is a paucity of biomechanical studies evaluating the efficacy and structural integrity of these techniques. Methods: Tendons were harvested from four lower extremity fresh cadaver specimens, including the extensor digitorum longus, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, and anterior tibialis tendons. Each tendon diameter was recorded using a digital Vernier caliper. Sixteen 3D printed proximal humeri models were allocated to either the single lasso loop with suture anchor (SLL) group or the whipstitch with knotless suture anchor (WSA) group. Each tenodesis model was initially tested on an electrodynamic material testing instrument under a cyclic load ranging from 5 to 70ÿN at a speed of 1.25ÿmm/s. The force on the tendon was then returned to 5ÿN, which was pulled until the ultimate failure of the construct. Displacement during cyclic loading, ultimate failure load, stiffness, and failure modes were assessed. Results: Fourteen tenodesis models were validated, and two models were discarded due to technical errors. No significant differences between the two groups were observed regarding tendon diameter, ultimate failure load, and displacement at ultimate failure load. However, the construct stiffness for the SLL group was lower than that of the WSA group (58.02 ñ 5.62ÿN/mm vs. 72.24 ñ 15.63ÿN/mm, P = 0.043). Conclusion: The SLL group had a lower construct stiffness than the WSA group, whereas construct displacement and ultimate failure load were similar in both groups. Therefore, SLL biceps tenodesis may offer a convenient alternative, with lower tendon migration fixation, while performing an arthroscopic biceps tenodesis. Level of evidence: Basic Science Study. ?

The Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner activity score, and postoperative imaging findings of all patients were collected. The final follow-up data were used to compare the differences among the three groups. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the general information of the three groups of patients. Among the 104 patients, the mean postoperative Lysholm score was 92.9 (CI, 91.0-94.8) in Group A, 93.4 (CI, 92.3?94.6) in Group B, and 93.5 (CI, 92.6?94.4) in Group C. Postoperative IKDC subjective assessment of knee function was considered normal or near normal in more than 95% of the patients in all three groups. More than 93% of the patients in all three groups did not have severe abnormalities in knee range of motion. The mean postoperative Tegner activity score was 6.7 (CI, 6.3?7.1) in Group A, 7.0 (CI, 6.7?7.3) in Group B, and 6.9 (CI, 6.6?7.1) in Group C. Imaging at 3 months after surgery revealed bone healing, and no serious postoperative complications were found in any of the three groups. Conclusion: All three treatments yielded good clinical results and imaging healing. In particular, arthroscopic suspension fixation with EndoButton is recommended as the preferred treatment because of its low invasiveness, good mechanical properties and low complication rate. ?

(2025),2025,Assessment of chronic ankle instability: Are functional scores relevant enough?; valuation de l'instabilit‚ chronique de la cheville : les scores fonctionnels sont-ils assez pertinents ?,"Introduction: A poorly treated acute ankle sprain can rapidly progress to chronic instability, with varying degrees of disability secondary to weakness of the ankle stabilizers. The aim of our study was to evaluate functional scores and physical tests in the assessment of eversion and proprioception deficits after non-surgical treatment of chronic ankle instability. Our hypothesis was that these functional scores and physical tests are suitable and sufficient for assessing the functional aspect of an unstable ankle. Material and method: This was a prospective, single-center study of patients managed for chronic ankle instability between November 2020 and November 2021. An ankle assessment was performed using two functional scores, the Foot Ankle Ability Measurement (FAAM) and the Ankle Ligament Reconstruction - Return to Sport after Injury (ALR-RSI), as well as two validated physical tests (Y-Balance Test and Side Hope Test). An objective (quantified) assessment of stabilizer muscle strength and proprioception was carried out using a connected device (Myolux? Medik E-volution). Results: At last recoil, twenty-eight unstable ankles were included. Only the ALR-RSI score correlated strongly with Myolux? assessment of eversion strength (Rho [?] = 0.7; P < 0.001), and proprioception (Rho [?] = 0.8; P < 0.001). FAAM and physical tests were not or only very moderately correlated with Myolux? assessments. Discussion: In the absence of the Myolux? test, the ALR-RSI score seemed the most suitable functional assessment of an unstable ankle in contrast to the FAAM score and the physical examinations Y-Balance Test and Side Hope Test.

649,SC-32,Badalamenti et al. (2025),2025,Kenyan Orthosiphon schimperi Benth. Essential Oil: Chemical Composition and Cytotoxic Activity on HeLa Cells,"The genus Orthosiphon Benth., is a relatively small genus of the Lamiaceae family that includes forty-four accepted species distributed mainly in tropical and sub-tropical areas of Asia, Southern Africa, and Madagascar. The species usually occurs in woodland, grassland, or forest margins. Due to their curative properties, species of this genus have been largely utilized in the popular medicine of several countries. Essential oil from fresh post-flowering aerial parts of Orthosiphon schimperi Benth. (OS), a taxon not previously studied, was collected in Kenyan territory, and it was obtained by hydrodistillation (yield 0.15%); its chemical profile was investigated by GC?MS analysis, using a DB-5ms low-polarity GC column. Oxygenated monoterpenes dominated the OS composition, and eugenol methyl ether (79.5%) was, by far, the main constituent of the sample. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the second most abundant class (8.8%), mainly constituted by caryophyllene oxide (8.2%). The biological activity of OS was assessed by using cytotoxicity assays on HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cell line) and HaCaT cells (non-tumorigenic human keratinocytes). OS exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells (IC<inf>50</inf> = 29.44 æg/mL after 24 h of treatment), while having minimal or no impact on HaCaT cell viability. Western blot analysis indicates that, indeed, the EO induces selective apoptosis in HeLa cells, thereby suggesting a potential anticancer activity exhibited by O. schimperi EO. ? 2025 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/plants14223513,Plants
650,SC-33,Oh et al. (2025),2025,Radiofrequency-Induced Thermal Modulation Reduces Senescence-Induced Collagen Fiber Degradation in Facial Ligaments of Animal Models,"Highlights: What are the main findings? Radiofrequency (RF) increased HSP70 expression and enhanced HSP70-IKK? binding, thereby reducing I?Bà phosphorylation and NF-?B activation in senescent fibroblasts and facial ligaments. RF restored the collagen type I/III ratio and collagen fiber density in senescent facial ligaments, with more favorable molecular responses observed at 42 W than at 73 W. What are the implications of the main findings? These findings suggest that HSP70 plays a central role in mediating RF-induced molecular remodeling during ligament senescence. RF provides preclinical evidence of a temperature-dependent mechanism that mitigates collagen degradation and supports extracellular matrix homeostasis in aging connective tissues. Age-related changes in facial ligaments contribute to altered facial shape and soft tissue descent. Radiofrequency (RF) has been utilized for skin rejuvenation by promoting collagen fiber contraction and synthesis through increased expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). The primary component of ligamentous collagen fibers undergoes structural modifications with age, exhibiting increased fragmentation and a reduced collagen type I/III ratio. This study aimed to investigate whether RF irradiation alleviates senescence-related changes in facial ligaments through HSP70-mediated molecular remodeling using a UV-induced photoaging rat model. In senescent fibroblasts, RF enhanced the interaction between HSP70 and I?Bà kinase (IKK)? while reducing I?Bà phosphorylation, which was associated with decreased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) activation. These RF-mediated changes were attenuated by an HSP70 inhibitor, suggesting that RF reduces NF-?B activity via HSP70 modulation. RF also suppressed expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases and SMAD7 in senescent fibroblasts. Consistent with in vitro findings, RF increased the interaction between HSP70 and IKK? while decreasing I?Bà phosphorylation and NF-?B activity in the UV-induced photoaging (senescent) facial ligaments of rat models. Furthermore, RF enhanced the collagen type I/III ratio and increased collagen fiber density within the ligaments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that RF irradiation increased collagen fiber bundle diameter and enhanced the helical structure of those fibers. Overall, RF mitigates senescence-related changes in facial ligaments through HSP70 modulation. Considering that facial ligament laxity contributes to soft tissue descent, facial ligament-targeting approaches may promote a more youthful facial structure. RF demonstrates the possibility in reducing senescence-associated changes within facial ligaments. ? 2025 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/cells14221757,Cells
651,SC-34,Bartkoski et al. (2025),2025,Current Trends and Indications for Extra-Articular Reconstruction in Revision ACL Reconstruction: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Background: The management of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) presents unique challenges that require careful consideration of graft selection and the role of anterolateral complex (ALC) augmentation. Although surgical techniques continue to evolve, there is variability in clinical practice patterns for revision ACLR. Purpose: To assess current trends in revision ACLR, including ALC augmentation indications, preferred augmentation techniques, and choice of graft type. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A survey was distributed by email to all members of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM). The survey included a demographics section (5 questions) and a revision ACLR section (12 questions). Descriptive statistics were performed. Results: There were 469 responses (response rate, 14%), with respondents more commonly being male (90%), fellowship-trained (95%), and in private practice (42%). The revision ACLR volume rose with the number of years in practice (P = .008). The autograft patellar tendon (47%) was the most frequently selected revision graft, followed by the quadriceps tendon (22%). The graft choice was associated with fellowship training (P = .006), years of experience (P < .001), and type of practice (P = .015). ALC augmentation was used by 70% of respondents, mostly for multiple (52%) or single (37%) previous ACLR failures and contact athlete status (17%). Its use was more common among early-career (88%; P = .006) and academic (87%; P < .001) surgeons. Practice setting correlated with the choice between lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALL) (P = .03), with academic surgeons utilizing LET at the highest rate. ALL was favored in patients with a body mass index of >35 kg/m2(P = .003) and LET in contact sport athletes (P = .006). Altogether, 80% of the surgeons preferred LET over ALL as their primary choice for augmentation. Conclusion: Revision ACLR practices vary widely, with no uniform consensus on graft choice and indications for ALC augmentation. ALC augmentation is most frequently indicated for patients with multiple previous failures. LET is the preferred augmentation technique, and the autograft patellar tendon is the most utilized graft in revision ACLR. Long-term outcomes of revision ACLR should be further studied to define ideal indications for augmentation and graft selection to address the relatively poor outcomes observed in patients undergoing revision ACLR. ?

652,SC-35,Wikstrom et al. (2025),2025,Impact of Plantar Massage and Ankle Mobilization on Visual Reliance in Those With Chronic Ankle Instability: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Context: Those with chronic ankle instability (CAI) rely more on visual information to maintain postural control. Plantar massage and ankle joint mobilization are moderately successful at improving CAI-associated postural control impairments. Manual therapies may have a larger influence on the underlying sensory strategy used to maintain postural control, but their effect on these strategies remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the effects of separate 2-week plantar massage and ankle joint mobilization interventions on estimates of visual reliance during single-limb stance in those with CAI and determine whether changes in visual reliance estimates were driven by concurrent changes in peripheral-or spinal-level sensorimotor function. Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients: Sixty participants with CAI. Interventions: Participants were equally randomized into plantar massage, ankle joint mobilization, and control (no intervention) groups. The manual therapy groups received six 5-minute treatments of their respective interventions over a 2-week period. Main Outcome Measure: A percentage modulation outcome quantified an individual?s reliance on visual information by estimating the weight given to visual information during eyes-open stance based on the magnitude of postural instability that occurs with vision removed. Secondary measures included joint position sense, plantar light-touch thresholds, and the H-reflex. Outcomes were captured before (baseline), immediately after (post), and 1-month (follow-up) after the 2-week intervention. Results: Plantar massage resulted in significant percentage modulation changes in sagittal (P ó .046) but not frontal plane outcomes (P ò .069) relative to the control group. Joint mobilization did not alter percentage modulation changes (P ò .413). Significant correlations between percentage modulation changes and peripheral sensorimotor function were noted primarily at the 1-month followup. Conclusions: A 2-week plantar massage but not an ankle joint mobilization intervention alters sagittal plane percentage modulation values during single-limb stance in those with CAI. These changes may be driven by changes in peripheral sensorimotor function. ? 2025 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2024-0299,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

654,SC-37,Perelli et al. (2025),2025,Augmented Over-The-Top Technique for Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is technically demanding, particularly in cases with femoral tunnel malposition or tibial tunnel enlargement. The over-the-top (OTT) technique offers a single-stage solution by avoiding femoral tunnel drilling. However, its main limitation is the reduced graft diameter, typically between 5.5 and 7 mm, which may be insufficient in revision settings. This Technical Note describes an augmentation of the classic OTT technique using a peroneus longus tendon allograft wrapped around preserved-insertion hamstring tendons, achieving graft diameters exceeding 8 mm. Standard arthroscopic portals are used to prepare a standard tibial tunnel, whereas a lateral femoral approach is performed to prepare the OTT point. Femoral fixation is secured with staples, and a lateral extra-articular tenodesis is performed to enhance rotational stability. This combined intra- and extra-articular reconstruction allows single-stage revision even in the presence of tunnel enlargement, improving biomechanical strength and potentially accelerating biological integration through preservation of the tibial insertion. The described technique offers a reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective option for complex anterior cruciate ligament revisions. ? 2025 The Authors.",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2025.103856,Arthroscopy Techniques
655,SC-38,Baek et al. (2025),2025,Comparative outcomes of middle trapezius tendon transfer using Achilles tendon allograft vs. fascia lata autograft for isolated supraspinatus tendon tears,"Background: Irreparable supraspinatus tendon tears pose significant challenges in surgical management, particularly when conventional arthroscopic repair methods are inadequate. Middle trapezius tendon (MTT) transfer has emerged as a potential salvage procedure, but the comparative efficacy of different interpositional grafts?such as Achilles tendon allografts and fascia lata autografts?remains unclear. Methods: This retrospective case series evaluated patients who underwent MTT transfer with either an Achilles tendon allograft (group A) or fascia lata autograft (group F) from December 2019 to March 2022. Included patients had persistent pain after conservative treatment, minimal glenohumeral arthritis, and severe supraspinatus retraction with high fatty infiltration. Clinical outcomes were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using visual analog scale for pain, along with patient-reported outcome measures including the Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, University of California, Los Angeles, and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation scores. Radiological assessments evaluated the integrity of the transferred tendon and glenohumeral arthritis progression. Results: A total of 33 patients (20 in group A and 13 in group F) were included. Both groups showed significant improvements in visual analog scale scores and patient-reported outcomes (P < .001) with no notable differences between them. Shoulder range of motion and strength also improved significantly in both groups. There was no significant progression of glenohumeral arthritis and no significant difference in rate of complications between the groups. Conclusions: MTT transfer is an effective surgical option for patients with irreparable supraspinatus tendon tears, yielding substantial improvements in pain and shoulder function regardless of the interpositional graft used. Both Achilles tendon allografts and fascia lata autografts demonstrated similar outcomes, offering flexibility in surgical approach based on individual patient considerations. ? 2025",Scopus,10.1016/j.jse.2025.02.021,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery
656,SC-39,Zych et al. (2025),2025,Height and weight predict cross-sectional area of the peroneus brevis and longus tendons: Magnetic resonance imaging-based analysis of 164 adults,"Purpose: To determine whether height, weight and body mass index (BMI) are associated with the cross-sectional area of the peroneus brevis and longus tendons on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Understanding these associations may assist in autograft selection and evaluation of residual tendon function after graft harvest. Methods: This retrospective study included 164 adult patients (mean age 41.6 ñ 15.7 years; 52% female) who underwent 3T ankle MRI between 2018 and 2024. Patients with peroneal tendon pathology (e.g., split tears, tendinosis), prior surgery or artefacts (e.g., motion or metal-related signal loss) were excluded. Cross-sectional areas were measured 1 cm above the lateral malleolus on axial proton density-weighted images. Height and weight were obtained from pre-MRI exam documentation. Associations with tendon cross-sectional area were evaluated using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for age and side. Results: Mean cross-sectional areas were 14.0 ñ 4.2 mmý for the peroneus brevis and 19.3 ñ 4.7 mmý for the peroneus longus. Peroneus brevis area was significantly associated with height (? = 12.9 mmý/m, p < 0.001) and age (? = 0.06 mmý/year, p < 0.001). Peroneus longus area was associated with weight (? = 0.07 mmý/kg, p = 0.01). No significant associations were found with BMI. All findings were robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Height and weight are reliable predictors of peroneal tendon size; BMI is not. MRI is a standardised, noninvasive tool for individualised graft planning and assessment of postoperative tendon integrity. These findings may assist in autograft planning and in evaluating residual tendon function after graft harvest. Level of Evidence: Level III. ? 2025 The Author(s).

(2025),2025,Peroneus Longus Versus Hamstring Tendon Graft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Retrospective Matched Comparison,"Background/Objectives: This study aimed to compare clinical and functional outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using peroneus longus tendon (PLT) versus hamstring tendon (HT) autografts in matched cohorts. Materials and Methods: A retrospective matched cohort study with 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching without replacement on sex (exact), age (ñ3 years), and time to last follow-up (closest match) was performed on consecutive primary single-bundle ACLR cases. After exclusions and follow-up completion, 77 PLT patients were matched 1:1 with 82 HT patients based on age, sex, and follow-up. Outcomes included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form, Lysholm Knee Score, Tegner Activity Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, knee range of motion, manual strength testing, stability tests, limb circumferences, and the Single-Leg Hop test. Additionally, ankle-specific function in the PLT group was assessed using the AOFAS and FADI scores. Results: Graft diameter was larger with PLT (8.5 ñ 0.6 mm) than with HT (8.1 ñ 0.7 mm; p = 0.003). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement from the preoperative to the postoperative period on the IKDC, Lysholm, and Tegner scores (all p < 0.001). Between groups, postoperative IKDC and Lysholm scores were comparable (both p > 0.05), and Tegner scores did not differ significantly (p > 0.05). Knee flexion loss was less frequent (9.1% vs. 68.3%; p = 0.001), and knee flexion strength was higher (4.7 ñ 0.5 vs. 4.0 ñ 0.8; p = 0.001) in PLT. Stability tests, LSI, extension strength, and limb circumferences were similar (all p > 0.05). Saphenous nerve symptoms were less frequent with PLT (13.0% vs. 29.3%; p = 0.010). Ankle function in PLT was preserved (AOFAS 96.9 ñ 7.9; FADI 97.4 ñ 8.5) with mild eversion limitation in 3 patients (3.9%). Re-rupture rates were low and did not differ significantly between groups (p > 0.05). Infections occurred only after HT, yielding a between-group difference (p = 0.030). Conclusions: PLT autografts provide clinical and functional outcomes comparable to those of HT, with advantages including a larger graft diameter, better preservation of knee flexion function, fewer symptoms related to the saphenous nerve, and excellent ankle outcomes. PLT is a safe and effective alternative for primary ACLR. ? 2025 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/jcm14207319,Journal of Clinical Medicine

(2025),2025,Platelet-derived mitochondria attenuate muscle atrophy following rotator cuff tears in a rat model,"Background: Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) often result in muscle atrophy, compromising surgical outcomes and recovery. Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in this process, suggesting potential for mitochondria-based therapies. This study aimed to investigate the effects of platelet-derived mitochondria (Plt-Mito) administration into the supraspinatus muscle (SSP) following RCTs. Methods: Seventy-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated into 3 distinct groups: (1) a sham surgery group, (2) a group with RCTs treated with Plt-Mito, and (3) a group with RCTs treated with phosphate-buffered saline. Treatments were administered every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, the SSPs were analyzed for wet muscle weight ratio, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, fibrosis, antioxidant activity, mitochondrial markers, capillary density, and mitochondrial structure. Results: Plt-Mito successfully incorporated into SSP, maintaining functional integrity. Compared to the phosphate-buffered saline group, Plt-Mito treatment significantly preserved wet muscle weight, increased mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area, promoted muscle regeneration, reduced fibrosis, enhanced antioxidant activity (increased superoxide dismutase activity and decreased malondialdehyde activity), improved muscle vascularity (increased platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and à-smooth muscle actin), increased expression of mitochondrial markers (C oxidase subunit IV and uncoupling protein 1) and maintained mitochondrial density and structure. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated Plt-Mito administration effectively halted muscle atrophy and fibrosis, while attenuating mitochondrial damage and dysfunction following RCTs. ? 2025 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Scopus,10.1016/j.jse.2025.01.031,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery

(2025),2025,Superior fulcrum reconstruction using autologous peroneus longus tendon for irreparable massive rotator cuff tears in rabbits: A comparative study,"Background: The autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT), which is a common graft in sports medicine. However, superior fulcrum reconstruction (SFR) using autologous PLT for irreparable massive rotator cuff tears (IMRCT) have not been reported. The objective of this study is to histologically evaluate the effect of the SFR using autologous PLT on tendon-to-bone healing. Methods: 30 mature New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study, and were used to build the model of irreparable massive rotator cuff tears, which were randomly divided into two groups of 15 rabbits in each group, with superior fulcrum reconstruction (SFR group) and superior capsule reconstruction (SCR group). Five rabbits in each group were sacrificed at 4, 8 and 12ÿweeks postoperatively for histological assessment. Results: In the histological analysis, there was no significant difference in the modified tendon maturation scoring system and semiquantitative evaluation of the cartilage staining area at 4ÿweeks. For 8ÿweeks and 12ÿweeks, SFR group confirmed a higher scoring level than SCR group. In the Immunohistochemical evaluation, the SFR group showed better angiogenesis and higher expression of collagen I compared to the SCR group at 8ÿweeks and 12ÿweeks. Conclusion: The superior fulcrum reconstruction using autologous PLT can promote a better biological healing process. It could be used as a clinical option for irreparable massive rotator cuff tears. ? The Author(s) 2025.

Methods: 235 patients who underwent hip joint surgery between January 2021 and January 2022 were enrolled as regular group (RG, routine care plan), and 268 patients who underwent hip joint surgery between February 2022 and February 2023 were enrolled as joint group (JG, IPC combined with ENS care plan). The RG only received routine nursing, and the JG received IPC plus ENS nursing. The subjects? coagulation indicators, DVT incidence, postoperative recovery, and other indicators were sorted out. Results: After IPC plus ENS nursing, hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet (PLT) in the JG were visibly lower as against the RG (p &lt; .05); As against the RG, the diameter of bilateral common femoral vein (CFV) did not decrease, and the maximum blood flow velocity (BFV) and average BFV of bilateral CFV were visibly higher in the JG (p &lt; .05). In the JG, fibrinogen (FIB), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were visibly increased, while D-dimer (D-D) and thrombin time (TT) were visibly decreased; the incidence of DVT was visibly lower; the immobile time in bed and hospital stay was visibly shortened, and the nursing satisfaction of patients was visibly increased (all p &lt; .05). Conclusion: IPC plus ENS in the nursing of patients after OS can effectively reduce the incidence of DVT and promote postoperative recovery. ? The Author(s) 2025.

Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are frequently observed in sports injuries. The peroneus longus tendon graft has rapidly gained a place in the literature; however, very few studies have been conducted on the foot-ankle region stability of this tendon. Purpose: To investigate the effect on this region of the peroneus longus tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Study Design: Case series, Level of evidence 4. Methods: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023. The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded. Results: The dynamometer measurements of the donor side and the contralateral side were compared. No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the ankle eversion and plantar flexion strength measurements (P = .096, P = .835, respectively). A significant result was obtained in the flamingo test (P = .049). No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the anterior, posterior, and lateral distances of the Y test (78.8 vs 78.6 cm, P = .973; 96.6 vs 80.4 cm, P = .053; 89.5 vs 95.0 cm, P = .357, respectively). In the examination of ankle functionality, no statistically significant difference was determined in the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score of the 2 sides (P = .798, P = .206, respectively). Conclusion: The peroneus longus tendon can be safely used as an alternative autograft in ACLR without causing donor site morbidity. There may be a deficit in balance test performance. ?

663,SC-46,Liang et al. (2025),2025,Harvesting of Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"Autografts are always used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Traditional sources, such as hamstring tendons, bone-patellar tendon-bone, and quadriceps tendon, are popular choices but may result in muscle imbalances and dynamic differences in knee kinematics. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as an alternative autograft for ACL reconstruction, offering comparable functional outcomes and avoiding interference with the flexor-extensor complexes of the knee. However, concerns about donor site paresthesia and ankle dysfunction have been raised in PLT harvesting. This article presents a detailed protocol for safely and effectively obtaining this autograft. The protocol emphasizes critical steps, modifications, and potential troubleshooting methods. In this study, we assessed functional scores, donor paresthesia, and other complications in 20 patients six months after PLT harvesting. Our findings indicate that this protocol for PLT acquisition did not result in significant complications. Therefore, we confirm the effectiveness of this protocol and offer guidance on essential preoperative preparations and surgical techniques. ? 2025 JoVE Journal of Visualized Experiments.",Scopus,10.3791/66390,Journal of Visualized Experiments

(2025),2025,Percussion Massage Therapy Reduced EMG Activity During Standing Heel Raise,"Objectives: This study examined the acute impact of percussion massage therapy (PMT) on calf muscle activation during heel raises in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI). Methods: Thirty-nine university students, 20 with CAI and 19 controls, were randomized to 30 seconds of PMT or no intervention (NOPMT). Surface EMG measured medial gastrocnemius activity during heel raise before and after. Results: Pre-intervention, CAI limbs displayed significantly lower peak muscle activation than limbs without CAI (26%, p = 0.012). Post-intervention, both PMT groups showed significant reductions in peak EMG (CAI: 10%, controls: 12%, p < 0.05), while NOPMT groups remained unchanged. Conclusion: These results indicate CAI is associated with reduced calf muscle activation, and PMT further decreases it. However, PMT?s activation-reducing effect may be counterproductive when increased muscle activation is desired, necessitating further research on PMT?s interaction with activation exercises. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects and optimal timing of PMT in rehabilitation and athletic settings. ? 2025, International Society of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions.

(2025),2025,Editorial Commentary: Lateral Extra-articular Augmentations in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Reduce Anterior Cruciate Ligament Graft Failure and Secondary Meniscectomy and Are Indicated for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Primary and Revision Reconstruction,"In the past decade, increasing evidence supports knee lateral extra-articular tenodesis or anterolateral ligament reconstruction for anterolateral rotational instability in patients requiring anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Extra-articular augmentation reduces the risk of ACL graft failure, particularly in high-risk populations. Recent research shows a 3-fold lower risk of failure and a lower rate of secondary meniscectomy. Indications include revision ACL reconstruction, pivoting sports participation, high-grade pivot shift, hyperlaxity or knee hyperextension, anterolateral complex injury on imaging evaluation, chronic ACL tear, meniscus repair, increased anterior translation (>7 mm), and posterior tibial slope >12ø. We perform extra-articular procedures for every patient at high risk for rerupture, which currently accounts for more than 90% of our primary ACL reconstruction cases. Lateral extra-articular procedures may also be a viable option for treating patients who have undergone isolated ACL reconstruction and have symptomatic minor instabilities and an intact ACL graft. ? 2025 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.arthro.2025.04.018,Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery

Methods A total of 32 patients who underwent revision ACL reconstruction from January 2020 to March 2023 were included. The ipsilateral semitendinosus tendon, gracilis tendons, and the anterior half of the ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon, were harvested to constitute the autograft. In patients in whom the ipsilateral semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were unavailable, the bilateral anterior halves of the peroneus longus tendons were utilised. The ACL+ALS group, with bigger transplant graft (diameter >8 mm, n=17; males 13, females 4; mean age 28.29ñ7.90 years), ACL combined with ALS reconstruction were performed. The three-in-one group (n=15; males 8, females 7; mean age 29.53ñ6.73 years) underwent additional iliotibial band (ITB) transposition for grafts with diameter <8 mm (excluding ITB). Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and graft dimensions were compared. Graft healing was evaluated via postoperative MRI. Knee stability was evaluated via the Lachman test. Lysholm knee score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and Tegner activity scale were compared preoperatively, 6-months postoperatively, and 12-months postoperatively, to assess knee function recovery. Results Surgical parameters revealed that the ACL+ALS group had an operative time of 47.82ñ9.32 min, blood loss of 29.00ñ6.99 ml, graft diameter of 8.77ñ0.69 mm; three-in-one group had an operative time of 57.47ñ10.06 min, blood loss of 36.33ñ6.99 ml, graft diameter of 8.53ñ0.52 mm. Although graft diameter showed no significant intergroup difference (t=1.065, P>0.05), the three-in-one group showed significantly longer operative times and greater blood loss (t=2.815, P=0.009; t=2.746, P=0.010). The average follow-up time of the ACL+ALS group was 19.47ñ5.25 months (range, 12-28 months), whereas the three-in-one group was 20.40ñ6.50 months (range, 12-32 months). Postoperative MRI showed continuous and homogeneous graft signals in both groups at 6 and 12 months. Lachman test showed negative in 15 cases, grade I in 2 cases in the ACL+ALS group; and negative in 14 cases, grade I in 1 case in the three-in-one group. Both groups exhibited significant improvement from preoperative status (P<0.001), with no intergroup difference (P=1.000). Functional scores revealed that both groups showed significant improvement in Lysholm, IKDC, and Tegner scores at 6 and 12 months (P<0.05 vs. preoperative), with no intergroup differences (P>0.05). In KOOS subscales, the three-in-one group had significantly lower scores than the ACL+ALS group in pain (88.89ñ5.75 vs. 94.77ñ3.79 at 6 months; 89.26ñ5.93 vs. 96.41ñ3.22 at 12 months) and sports/recreation (71.33ñ12.32 vs. 83.53ñ9.31 at 6 months; 73.67ñ13.43 vs. 88.24ñ8.65 at 12 months; P<0.05). Conclusions When the graft diameter is greater than or equal to 8 mm, both the three-in-one procedure and ACL combined with ALS reconstruction are effective for revision ACL reconstruction. However, patients who underwent three-in-one procedure experienced higher postoperative pain levels. ? 2025 Chinese Medical Association.",Scopus,10.3760/cma.j.cn121113-20250103-00010,Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics

With the increasing number of primary and revision arthroscopic surgeries on large joints performed annually, the incidence of infectious complications has also grown. The aim of this study is to present the outcome of a successful two-stage treatment of a female patient with knee joint infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Materials and Methods A 22-year-old female patient diagnosed with chronic posttraumatic osteomyelitis of the right femur and tibia, arthritis of the right knee following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the right knee. Her medical records stated several failures of debridement surgeries. The first stage involved joint debridement, removal of the infected ACL graft, and filling of the bone defects with bone cement containing antibacterial agents. In the second stage, the bone cement was removed, the bone defects were filled with allograft bone chips, and ACL reconstruction was performed using the peroneus longus tendon. Clinical, instrumental, and functional evaluations of treatment effectiveness were performed. Results The treatment managed to control the infection. Remission of the infection was achieved, and function of the affected limb was restored. The follow-up period was two years. Discussion There are few publications in the Russian medical literature on the treatment of infection after arthroscopic surgery on large joints. This clinical case demonstrates a positive outcome in infection resolution after ACL reconstruction with forced ligament removal following failures of debridement procedures. Conclusion The choice of treatment strategy was based on the patient's medical history and desired needs. The management of knee infection that developed after ACL reconstruction included appropriately selected and administered antibiotic therapy and the necessary number of timely surgical interventions. This optimally chosen approach ultimately resulted in good outcome. ? Davletova E.G., Triapichnikov A.S., Ermakov A.M., Kaminsky A.V., 2025 ? Translator Tatyana A.

669,SC-52,Wang et al. (2025),2025,Ligament reconstruction combined with osteotomy: Case report,"Rationale: Valgus deformity of the knee joint is caused by congenital anatomical abnormalities. The occurrence of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear in conjunction with a medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), alongside knee valgus deformity, is exceedingly rare in clinical practice. Patient concerns: A 30-year-old female presented with congenital valgus knee. The left knee joint was immobile due to pain and swelling after trauma. The patient had a history of hypertension. Diagnoses: The patient underwent an MRI of the left knee joint at a local hospital, and was diagnosed with ACL injury of the left knee, medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) injury of the patella, and congenital valva deformity. Interventions: The patient underwent simultaneous reconstruction of the ACL and MPFL, as well as a distal femoral osteotomy. Outcomes: The patient experienced significant postoperative improvement, with marked pain relief. The knee remained stable, and functional recovery was observed. Lessons: Failure to adequately address the stability of the patella following the rupture of the MPFL may result in increased stress on the ACL graft, thereby heightening the risk of graft failure. Additionally, valgus deformity can impose abnormal mechanical loads on the ACL graft, substantially elevating the likelihood of complications such as articular cartilage degeneration and meniscal injury. Usually, we need accurate guidance on imaging and evaluation of surgical options to successfully complete the surgery. ? 2025 the Author(s).",Scopus,10.1097/MD.0000000000043419,Medicine (United States)
670,SC-53,Calvo Rodr¡guez et al. (2025),2025,Effect of diameter reduction by compression on peroneus longus allograft integrity: A biomechanical analysis,"Background: There is broad consensus regarding the minimum required graft diameter in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery; a diameter of at least 8 mm is recommended when using hamstring tendon grafts. However, it remains unclear what happens when a larger-diameter graft is compressed to a smaller diameter, and how this alteration may affect the biomechanical properties of the graft. The objectives is determine whether the biomechanical strength of compressed allografts is preserved after reducing their diameter, and whether compression techniques could be considered a viable option for smaller patients such as women and children. Our hypothesis is that a compressed graft may retain similar strength to the original, despite having a reduced diameter. Methods: This was a cadaveric biomechanical case-control study using 30 peroneus longus (PL) tendon allografts. The grafts were divided into three groups: Group 0 (8 mm uncompressed grafts), Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts), and Group 2 (10 mm with a graft tube, compression to 9 mm). Each graft was tested using a Zwick/Roell Z005 tensile testing machine, undergoing cyclic loading between 50 and 250 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles, followed by continuous tensile loading to failure. The maximum failure force (Fmax) was recorded for each graft. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.18.5. Results: Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts) showed a mean maximum failure force of 1902 N (SD: 432.12; 95 % CI). Group 2 (compressed grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1608 N (SD: 233.12; 95 % CI), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.037). Group 0 (native 8 mm grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1341 N (SD: 936.67; 95 % CI). No statistically significant difference was found between Group 0 and Group 2 (p = 0.196). Conclusions: The results indicate that the compressed group had lower resistance compared to the original 9 mm grafts. However, when compared to the smaller-diameter grafts, no significant difference in strength was observed. Nonetheless, the compressed grafts showed a tendency to withstand higher loads than the native 8 mm grafts. ? 2025 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation",Scopus,10.1016/j.jor.2025.06.036,Journal of Orthopaedics

Among the various treatment options for irreparable massive RCTs, rotator cuff reconstruction is considered a reasonable approach, yet there is no consensus on the optimal reconstruction technique. In this article, we introduce a suture anchor onlay technique for rotator cuff reconstruction. In our technique, the peroneus longus tendon is harvested and prepared as an autograft, and on the lateral side, a suture anchor is implanted to fix the autograft on the greater tuberosity surface. The key steps of our technique are performing anchor implantation to ensure that the autografts are fixed tightly on the greater tuberosity surface, knotting the sutures from the medial-row anchors that we pre-implanted at the midsubstance of the autograft to provide additional fixation, and finally, achieving ?onlay? fixation of the autografts. Our technique can effectively reduce surgical time, simplify the reconstruction procedure, and has good clinical application value. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2025.103700,Arthroscopy Techniques

(2025),2025,Regional muscle fiber conduction velocity of the fibularis longus in individuals with chronic ankle instability,"The fibularis longus muscle, divided into anterior and posterior neuromuscular regions, plays a significant role in eversion strength deficits in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). However, it is unknown whether the muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) of these neuromuscular regions is different between individuals with CAI and those without a history of ankle sprain. This study aimed to compare the MFCV of the anterior and posterior neuromuscular regions of the fibularis longus between individuals with CAI and healthy individuals. A case?control study was conducted. Thirty-five male volunteers were included in the analysis (CAI group: n = 18; No-CAI group: n = 17). High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) was used to record the sEMG amplitude and to calculate the MFCV of the fibularis longus neuromuscular regions (anterior and posterior) during eversion at different contraction intensities. The findings revealed that individuals with CAI exhibited significantly lower MFCV in the posterior region at moderate (30% and 50% maximum voluntary isometric contraction [MVC]) and high (70% and 100% MVC) contraction intensities compared with healthy individuals. Within the CAI group, the posterior neuromuscular region also demonstrated a lower MFCV than the anterior neuromuscular region. These findings indicate that CAI is associated with specific regional electrophysiological changes in the fibularis longus muscle, particularly in the posterior region. Understanding these alterations can inform targeted rehabilitation strategies aimed at improving muscle function and stability in CAI patients. Future research should explore the mechanisms underlying these changes to develop more effective therapeutic interventions. ? 2025 Anatomical Society.",Scopus,10.1111/joa.14244,Journal of Anatomy

Although ACL reconstruction is the first choice of treatment, which can significantly improve the stability and movement function of the knee joint, there are still some patients who have poor recovery or re-rupture after surgery, and require ACL revision surgery. Compared with primary ACL reconstruction, revision surgery is technically more demanding. Among them, graft selection is crucial for knee function recovery and reducing the risk of re-rupture after ACL revision. Currently, there is a lack of uniform norms and guidelines for graft selection in ACL revision reconstruction. Therefore, the Knee Group of Chinese Society of Sports Medicine and Sports Medicine Doctor Society of Chinese Medical Doctor Association jointly initiated the formulation of an expert consensus. The modified Delphi method is adopted to address ten key issues in graft selection in ACL reconstruction revision, and ten recommendations are finally formed. The purpose of this consensus is to help doctors scientifically and reasonably select grafts for revision ACL reconstruction and improve clinical outcomes. ? 2025 Chinese Medical Association.",Scopus,10.3760/cma.j.cn121113-20241104-00621,Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics
676,SC-59,Zhang et al. (2025),2025,Gait Characteristics and Deviation Factors of Backward Walking in Patients With Chronic Ankle Instability,"Background: Despite growing applications of backward walking (BW) in assessing and rehabilitating neuromuscular conditions, its effects on gait in chronic ankle instability (CAI) remain unclear. Moreover, linking patient-reported and clinically generated measures is imperative for understanding CAI. Hypotheses: Patients with CAI will exhibit worse and compensatory spatio-temporal and kinetic gait parameters during BW, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) will be correlated significantly with gait parameters. Study Design: Case-control study. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Methods: A total of 46 volunteers participated (23 per group). Patients filled out scales for pain, functions, and fear-avoidance beliefs before testing. All participants walked 6 times each in both forward and backward conditions, and gait was recorded using the Win-Track system. A 2-way mixed analysis of variance was performed to compare gait parameters. The relationship between PRO and gait outcomes was assessed through the Pearson product correlation coefficient. Results: The CAI group demonstrated prolonged support and swing phases, increased walk-off angle, and plantar pressure area, but decreased step length and plantar pressure versus controls (P < 0.05). The CAI group had a smaller right walk-off angle during BW than FW; the control group showed the opposite (P < 0.05). The left single stance duration was greater in the CAI group, while the right was not (P < 0.05). PRO correlated significantly with gait parameters, particularly spatial parameters (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The CAI group exhibited worse gait parameters during BW. The CAI group exhibited a characteristic compensatory gait pattern. Linking the self-reported scores provides a better representation of gait changes in CAI. Clinical Relevance: These results suggest that BW may be an effective strategy for identifying and evaluating CAI. It may be feasible to apply BW to the rehabilitation of CAI. ? 2024 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1177/19417381241277804,Sports Health
677,SC-60,Kiedrowski et al. (2025),2025,Minimum 5-Year Outcomes After Minimally Invasive Achilles Tendon Reconstruction Using Autologous Hamstring Grafts,"Background: The Achilles tendon is prone to rupture, particularly in middle-aged men, and chronic injuries are often due to missed diagnoses or inadequate treatment. While acute ruptures can be managed with primary repair, chronic cases with tendon gaps >3?cm require reconstruction. A minimally invasive technique using autologous semitendinosus and gracilis tendon grafts has previously shown favorable short-term outcomes. This study evaluates longer-term outcomes with a minimum 5-year follow-up. Methods: This study analyzed 21 patients undergoing minimally invasive Achilles tendon reconstruction with autologous hamstring grafts, compared with 21 healthy controls. magnetic resonance imaging confirmed diagnoses, and surgeries (2016?2019) used the EndoButton system for graft stabilization. Assessments included Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) for patient-reported outcomes, EuroQoL?5 Dimensions, 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) for overall health, and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and satisfaction. Functional tests measured dorsiflexion (lunge test), calf endurance (heel rise test), and muscle strength (single-leg hop test), comparing operated vs unoperated legs. Results: ATRS and EQ-5D-5L Index improved from 2 to 5?years (P?=?.0136, P?=?.0396), although significance was lost after Bonferroni correction. Functional test results remained stable. The operated limb achieved >90% of the nonoperated side across tests. Compared with controls, patients reported lower EQ-5D-5L scores and greater pain (P?<?.05), but satisfaction remained high (VAS score 9/10). One retear occurred due to infection. Conclusion: Minimally invasive Achilles tendon reconstruction using hamstring autografts results in sustained functional and subjective improvements at a minimum of 5?years postoperatively. Despite modest residual deficits compared with uninjured controls, high satisfaction and strong limb symmetry support the long-term efficacy of this approach. This study demonstrates that the functional and subjective results of patients after Achilles tendon reconstruction with hamstring graft remain stable and satisfactory at a minimum of 5?years postoperatively.

(2025),2025,Comparison of Motor Planning in the Cerebral Cortex During Gait Initiation Between Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability and Healthy Individuals,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate motor cortex activity during gait initiation in athletes with CAI compared to healthy individuals. Methods and Materials: Twenty-six participants were enrolled, divided into two groups: CAI and control (CON). After informed consent, participants completed the FAAM and Cumberland questionnaires. Following a warm-up, they stood on a force plate while wearing an EEG cap. Gait initiation was triggered by an auditory cue, and EEG data were collected using EEGLAB and analyzed with MATLAB. Findings: Analysis of motor planning parameters, including theta (4?8 Hz), alpha (8?12 Hz), beta (14?25 Hz), and gamma (35?50 Hz) frequency bands, revealed significant differences between the CAI and CON groups (p < 0.05). Theta activity, associated with attention and focus, showed significant differences at channels Fcz, Cz, and Cp4. Alpha band activity, linked to the activation and inhibition of sensorimotor functions, also showed significant differences at F4, Fz, Fc3, and Cp4. Conclusion: These findings indicate that athletes with CAI exhibit altered motor planning strategies, as demonstrated by changes in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands, particularly in the frontal and parietal regions of the brain. These changes were characterized by reduced power in all examined frequency bands in the CAI group, suggesting disruptions in cortical motor planning compared to healthy individuals. ? 2025 the authors.

679,SC-62,Wang et al. (2025),2025,Superior Fulcrum Reconstruction for Massive Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears Using the Peroneus Longus Tendon in 2 Variations: A Cadaveric Static Biomechanical Study,"Background: Massive and irreparable rotator cuff tears (MIRCTs) pose unique challenges, and clinicians have explored a variety of surgical approaches to manage them. However, the optimal treatment strategies for MIRCT remain widely debated. Purpose: To investigate the biomechanical effects of 2 superior fulcrum reconstruction (SFR) techniques?using either 2 halved autologous peroneus longus tendons (SFR-H) in a sutured bridge configuration or a single entire autologous peroneus longus tendon (SFR-E) in an ?X? configuration?on MIRCT in a static biomechanical setup. This study explores the biomechanical implications of these methods, aiming to address MIRCTs affecting the entire supraspinatus tendon and 50% of the infraspinatus tendon. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Eight cadaveric shoulders were subjected to biomechanical testing under 4 different conditions: Intact, MIRCT, SFR-E, and SFR-H. These tests were conducted at 0ø, 30ø, and 60ø of glenohumeral abduction. The parameters measured included the rotational range of motion, superior translation of the humeral head, and subacromial contact pressure. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc tests, with significance set at P < .05. Results: The MIRCT condition led to a significant increase in the superior translation of the humeral head at all tested abduction angles (P < .05 for all). By contrast, SFR-E significantly reduced this translation across all angles (P < .05 for all), while SFR-H effectively reduced it at 0ø and 30ø (P < .05 for both). After MIRCT, subacromial contact pressure significantly increased at all tested abduction angles compared with the Intact state (P < .05 for all). Following SFR-E, significant pressure reductions were observed at 0ø and 30ø abduction angles (P < .05 for both). Similarly, SFR-H led to significant pressure reductions at all abduction angles (P < .05 for all). Conclusion: Compared with MIRCT, both SFR-H and SFR-E techniques significantly reduce superior translation of the humeral head and subacromial contact pressure, without limiting the range of motion of the humerus. In cadaveric biomechanical experiments, the use of peroneus longus tendon for SFR via bone tunnels has been proven to be a reliable method. Additionally, peroneus longus tendon is a viable source for autografting. Clinical Relevance: The results of this study are significant for patients suffering from MIRCTs, as they demonstrate that both surgical techniques may be used to treat these tears, potentially improving shoulder function and alleviating associated symptoms. The success of the cadaveric experiments lays the groundwork for further clinical trials. ? The Author(s) 2025.

680,SC-63,Chia et al. (2025),2025,Investigating peroneus muscle quality in ankle stability: A comparative analysis between chronic ankle instability patients and healthy controls,"Objectives: To compare peroneal muscle quality between individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and healthy controls, and to examine their relationship with ankle stability. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Sports Medicine research laboratory. Methods: Sixty-five participants (35 with unilateral CAI, 30 healthy controls) were assessed. Peroneal muscle size, echogenicity, and passive stiffness were measured using ultrasound imaging and eversion strength was assessed with a hand-held dynamometer. Ankle stability was evaluated using the Y Balance Test (YBT), lateral step-down, and single-leg stance tests. Results: Compared to controls, individuals with CAI showed significantly lower eversion strength, higher muscle echogenicity, and increased passive stiffness. In the CAI group, greater stiffness and reduced strength were associated with higher centre of pressure displacement during single-leg stance. Higher eversion strength was associated with increased YBT scores across all participants. Echogenicity was not directly associated with stability functions. Conclusion: Deficits in peroneal muscle quality, involving echogenicity, strength and stiffness, are demonstrated in the CAI population. These factors are associated with impaired instability among CAI individuals. Interventions targeting peroneal muscle quality may improve balance and reduce the risk of recurrent ankle injuries in this population. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2025.06.001,Physical Therapy in Sport

A hamstring graft with a diameter of less than 8 mm is associated with nearly a 7-fold increase in the risk of failure. The technique proposed here introduces a hamstring braid graft configuration for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, offering a viable solution in cases where a larger graft diameter is needed. Mastering various hamstring graft preparation techniques is crucial to achieve an appropriate graft diameter and length that aligns with the patient's anatomy, height, and physical demands. In summary, the present technique, known as the Brazilian Braid, is a 4-strand hamstring braid graft that represents a reliable, easy-to-prepare, and reproducible graft preparation technique. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2025.103623,Arthroscopy Techniques
683,SC-66,Karaismailoglu et al. (2025),2025,"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Comparing Open FHL Tendon Transfer, Hamstring Transfer, and Turndown Flaps to Treat Chronic Achilles Tendon Ruptures","Background:Chronic Achilles tendon ruptures (CATRs) present significant challenges because of delayed diagnosis and more complicated salvage treatments that can result in unfavorable outcomes and increased rates of adverse events. Various reconstructive surgical options have been described, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Comprehensive comparison of these techniques, however, is lacking. This meta-analysis aimed to compare clinical outcomes following 3 of the most commonly used salvage techniques including flexor hallucis longus (FHL) transfer, hamstring transfer, and gastric-soleal turndown flap.Methods:This systematic review adhered to PRISMA guidelines and included studies registered on PROSPERO. Searches were conducted across multiple databases, and eligibility criteria encompassed studies reporting on clinical scores and complications following surgical treatment of CATRs with FHL transfer, hamstring tendon transfer, or turndown flaps. Data extraction, quality assessment, and statistical analyses were performed following standardized protocols.Results:Among 1910 identified studies, 25 met inclusion criteria with 11 focusing on FHL transfer, 9 on hamstring tendon transfer, and 6 on turndown flap management. A meta-analysis revealed variations in patient demographics, surgical techniques, and rehabilitation protocols across the 3 intervention groups. Although the mean improvement in American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scores was comparable (38.9 for turndown flap, 31.8 for FHL transfer, and 26.0 for hamstring transfer), complication rates differed significantly. The turndown flap group exhibited the highest overall complication rate, particularly because of wound-related complications, with a wound complication rate of 12.5%, compared with 5.7% for FHL transfer and 3.5% for hamstring transfer.Conclusion:This study underscores the challenge of evidence-based decision making in the surgical management of CATRs. Despite apparently similar functional outcomes, the choice of open surgical technique affects complication rates. Turndown flaps, although effective in restoring musculotendinous continuity, carry higher risks of wound complications compared with the other techniques evaluated. ?

684,SC-67,Capella et al. (2025),2025,Arthroscopic surgical technique for trans-septal reconstruction of posterior cruciate ligament and popliteus tendon bypass for posterolateral rotatory instability of the knee,"Posterolateral rotatory knee instability is a complex condition that requires careful evaluation and management. A significant proportion of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries involves concomitant injuries to the posterolateral corner (PLC), including the popliteal complex (popliteal tendon, arcuate ligament, and popliteal-fibular ligament) and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). Posterolateral rotatory instability, classified as type 2 according to Weiss classification, is commonly caused by a lesion of the PCL in combination with damage to the popliteal complex and in the absence of a LCL lesion. PCL and popliteus tendon (PLT) reconstruction showed promising results in restoring posterolateral knee stability. Several open reconstructions techniques of the PLC have been described, such as those proposed by LaPrade and Arciero, both of which are supported by extensive literature and widely used in clinical practice. In recent years, arthroscopic reconstruction techniques have been developed to improve surgical accuracy and clinical outcome. This work aims to present a detailed description of the arthroscopic PLT and all-inside trans-septal PCL reconstruction technique based on a four-stranded semitendinosus (ST) for the PCL reconstruction and a double-strand gracilis (G) graft for the PLT reconstruction. The technique involves the trans-septal visualization. The tibial and femoral sockets for PCL reconstruction are prepared with an all-inside retrograde drilling. Similarly, the tibial socket for PLT reconstruction is achieved with an all-inside retrograde drill, while a mini-open approach is used for the popliteus femoral socket preparation. The grafts are fixed with adjustable cortical suspension loop devices at both tibial and femoral sites. Pearls, pitfalls, and tips to avoid complications are thoroughly described. This technique can be applied to isolated Weiss 2 posterolateral rotatory instabilities and in the context of multiligament knee injuries with other major ligaments to repair or reconstruct. ?

(2025),2025,Comparative study of Peroneus longus tendon autograft versus Hamstring tendon autograft in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare the functional outcomes and donor site morbidities after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using peroneus longus (PL) tendon versus hamstring (HST) tendon autografts. Methods: The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. Results: A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18?20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group. Conclusions: PL tendon autograft can be used as a safe and effective autograft choice for ACLR with excellent functional outcomes comparable to HST tendon autograft and minimal donor site morbidity.

687,SC-70,Caubere et al. (2025),2025,Assessment of chronic ankle instability: are functional scores relevant enough?,"Introduction: A poorly treated acute ankle sprain can rapidly progress to chronic instability, with varying degrees of disability secondary to weakness of the ankle stabilizers. The aim of our study was to evaluate functional scores and physical tests in the assessment of eversion and proprioception deficits after non-surgical treatment of chronic ankle instability. Our hypothesis was that these functional scores and physical tests are suitable and sufficient for assessing the functional aspect of an unstable ankle. Material and method: This was a prospective, single-center study of patients managed for chronic ankle instability between November 2020 and November 2021. An ankle assessment was performed using two functional scores, the Foot Ankle Ability Measurement (FAAM) and the Ankle Ligament Reconstruction - Return to Sport after Injury (ALR-RSI), as well as two validated physical tests (Y-Balance Test and Side Hope Test). An objective (quantified) assessment of stabilizer muscle strength and proprioception was carried out using a connected device (Myolux? Medik e-volution). Results: At last recoil, twenty-eight unstable ankles were included. Only the ALR-RSI score correlated strongly with Myolux? assessment of eversion strength (Rho ()? = 0.7; p < 0.001), and proprioception (Rho ()? = 0.8; p < 0.001). FAAM and physical tests were not or only very moderately correlated with Myolux? assessments. Discussion: In the absence of the Myolux? test, the ALR-RSI score seemed the most suitable functional assessment of an unstable ankle in contrast to the FAAM score and the physical examinations Y-Balance Test and Side Hope Test.

688,SC-71,Rougereau et al. (2025),2025,Biomechanical assessment of ligament maturation after arthroscopic ligament reconstruction of the anterior talofibular ligament,"Background: Many techniques have been described for lateral ankle ligament reconstruction. Although the biomechanical properties of gracilis tendons are different from those of ligaments, the use of a gracilis tendon autograft is a popular option for anatomical reconstruction. Graft maturation and the biomechanical processes over time remain unclear. This study describes changes in graft stiffness following anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) reconstruction and graft reaction to varus stress. Hypothesis: The reconstruction would be stiffer than the native ATFL, but would decrease during follow-up. Methods: Twenty patients were prospectively included after arthroscopic reconstruction of the ATFL and calcaneofibular ligament for ankle stabilization. All patients were followed up 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery to assess graft stiffness by shear wave elastography (SWE) at different angles of varus in the ankle. At one year the EFAS and AOFAS functional scores were obtained. A control group of twenty healthy subjects were included to compare graft stiffness to that of a native ATFL. Results: The stiffness of the native ATFL in the control group was 12.8 +/? 2.4 kPa in neutral position, 18.4 +/? 4.8 kPa at 15 ø of varus, 31.9 +/? 6.6 kPa at 30 ø of varus. One year after surgery, graft stiffness was statistically higher and averaged 56 +/? 9 kPa, 70.2 +/? 11.6 kPa and 84.9 +/? 10.5 kPa, respectively. Postoperative graft stiffness at three, six, and twelve months was not correlated with any of these scores, reflecting patient satisfaction and good function at one year. Conclusion: Graft stiffness decreases over time but remains four times stiffer than that of a native ATFL at one year in the neutral position. ATFL graft stiffness at one year during varus stress appears to be different from that of a native ATFL.

(2025),2025,"Medial Collateral Ligament Repair, Isolated Suture-Tape-Bracing and No Repair for Grade III Medial Collateral Ligament Tears During Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Have Similar Outcome for Combined Anterior Cruciate Ligament With Medial Collateral Ligament Injury: A 3-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial","Purpose: To compare various medial collateral ligament (MCL) management strategies (repair vs isolated suture-tape bracing vs no repair) combined with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and analyze the results of MCL subtypes (femoral-sided, mid-substance, and tibial-sided tears) that occur at distinct levels. Methods: This study was a double-blind, prospective 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Ninety-six consecutive patients with combined ACL and grade III MCL acute & subacute injuries between 2020 and 2022 with minimum 24-month follow-up were included in the study. Chronic MCL injuries and other ligament injuries were excluded, and computer-generated randomization was performed for allotment into 3 MCL management groups. ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft was performed and the MCL underwent repair in group 1 (n = 33), isolated suture-tape-bracing in group 2 (n = 32), and no repair in group 3 (n = 31). At follow-up, stress radiographs were used to analyze anterior and medial laxity. The International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, duration of surgery, and cost of surgery were compared. In addition, subgroup analysis was performed to assess outcomes based on location of MCL injury. Results: Demographic data, duration of injury, mode of injury, and distinct level of MCL injury were similar across groups. Overall, the incidence rates of MCL tears on the femoral side, at the midsubstance, and on the tibial side were 58.3%, 18.7%, and 23.0%, respectively. Postoperatively, significant improvements in range of motion (ROM) and functional scores were observed in all 3 groups (P ó .05); however, there were no statistically significant differences among the 3 groups at final follow-up in anterior tibial translation (P = .94), medial opening at 0ø of flexion (P = .8) and 30ø of flexion (P = .64), ROM (P = .39), International Knee Documentation Committee score (P = .17), Lysholm score (P = .14), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (P = .68). Three patients in group 2 had stiffness at 3 months: 2 were treated with continuous passive motion and physiotherapy, and 1 needed arthrolysis. Medial opening (at 0ø and at 30ø) was greater in group 3 patients with mid-substance MCL tears (P = .042 and P = .043, respectively). On minimal clinically important difference analysis, more than 80% of patients had improvement in ROM and functional scores, as well as medial opening of less than 5 mm, suggestive of successful outcomes in all 3 groups. The duration of surgery was longer in the repair group (P = .001), whereas cost was higher in the suture-tape bracing group (P = .003). Conclusions: MCL treatment with repair, isolated suture-tape-bracing, and no repair results in good radiologic outcomes (medial stress laxity) and functional outcomes when combined with ACL reconstruction. MCL repair or isolated suture-tape-bracing more effectively restores medial-sided stability. Mid-substance MCL tears may need an additional procedure (repair or bracing) to restore medial stability.

690,SC-73,Hinz et al. (2025),2025,MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft satisfactorily restores knee stability with no impairment in foot function and with a low failure rate for concurrent ACL reconstruction,"Purpose: Addressing grade 2 and 3 medial-sided instabilities during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is crucial to reduce the risk of ACL graft failure. This study introduced a minimally invasive, medial collateral ligament (MCL) augmentation technique using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft, which was fixed to the femoral deep MCL insertion and tibial superficial MCL insertion. Methods: This prospective, longitudinal, single-centre case series included patients who underwent MCL augmentation concurrent with primary or revision ACL reconstruction due to anteromedial instability. Preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up, clinical examinations, such as rolimeter test of anterior tibial translation and medial instability, knee (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], Lsyholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and foot function scores (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score [AOFAS]) and complications, were analyzed. Results: Thirty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 13.5 ñ 2.6 months and a mean age of 27.8 ñ 9.6 years were included. The side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation significantly improved from preoperative to 1-year follow-up with an ACL reconstruction failure rate of 6.5%. No patient retained a grade 2 or 3 medial instability on valgus stress testing with 30ø flexion. Significant improvements from preoperative to 1-year postoperative follow-up were observed in knee function scores: IKDC (48.9 ñ 26.9? 71.3 ñ 11.5, p < 0.001) and Lysholm (59.9 ñ 28.5?80.5 ñ 11.2, p = 0.002) as well as KOOS pain, ADL, sport and QoL, each reaching the respective minimal clinically important difference values. The foot function score AOFAS showed no significant impairment (100 ñ 0?99.3 ñ 2.5, p = 0.250). Complications included cyclops lesions of ACL reconstruction in three patients. Conclusion: At 1-year follow-up, MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft for patients simultaneously undergoing ACL reconstruction satisfactorily restores knee stability, has a low ACL reconstruction failure rate and does not significantly impair foot function.

691,SC-74,Philippe et al. (2025),2025,Which tendon graft to choose for anatomical ligament reconstruction in chronic lateral ankle instability? A biomechanical study,"Background: The need for anatomic lateral ligament reconstruction of the ankle continues to grow. This procedure usually requires a gracilis autograft or in some cases an allograft. Siegler et al. reported the mechanical characteristics of the collateral lateral ligaments of the human ankle: 231 ñ 129 N for the ATFL and 307 ñ 142 N for the CFL. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanical properties of different tendon grafts available for ATFL and CFL reconstruction. We hypothesized that the properties of the tested grafts are not inferior to the published values of those of the original ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle. Methods: This was a comparative biomechanical study using 6 cadaver specimens (108 grafts): The biomechanical properties of nine types of grafts were determined using validated tensile testing methods: Gracilis, SemiT, EHL, FHL, Plantaris, Peroneus longus and brevis, TA and TP. The main outcome measure was the comparison of the mechanical properties of each single-stranded tendon with each other and with the known values ??for the ATFL and CFL, during a uniaxial static rupture test. Results: The mean load to failure for the gracilis was 257.5 ñ 52.9 N. The groups had similar mean values in terms of the maximum load that they could withstand before failing except for the plantaris (137.9 ñ 33.7 N) which was statistically lower than all other tested tendons (p < 0,01). The mean load to failure values of the grafts tested were equal or higher than that of the ATFL and CFL reported by Siegler et al. [14]: 231 ñ 129 N for the ATFL and 307 ñ 142 N for the CFL, while the grafts tested here had mean failure load between 258 ñ 53 N and 464 ñ 136 N. Conclusion: The gracilis, peroneus longus/brevis, EHL, FHL, TA, TP and semiT are legitimate grafts for combined ATFL and CFL reconstruction in the ankle. These tendons have mechanical properties (load to failure, maximum strain at failure and stiffness) that are equal to or higher than the native ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle, except the plantaris. Clinical relevance: This study validates the current use of the gracilis autograft for the anatomical reconstruction of the ATFL and CFL, and even provides proof that other tendons would be suitable for this anatomical reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligament by auto or even allograft under certain conditions.

Study Design: Prospective longitudinal study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Combined Military Hospital, Lahore Pakistan from Jul 2020 to Jun 2023. Methodology: We included all the young athletes who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were followed for three months. The anterior drawer test and Pivot shift test were used to assess the study participants for ligamentization of the reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament. Relevant socio-demographic and clinical factors were associated with non-return to sports in patients at the end of three months. Results: A total of 121 patients with ACL repair were recruited for this study. The mean age of the study participants was 28.20ñ6.73 years. After three months, 49(40.4%) patients did not return to sports, while 72(59.5%) did. Statistical analysis revealed that high body mass index, psychiatric morbidity, and not undergoing regular physiotherapy were statistically significantly associated with non-return to sports (p-value <0.005). Conclusion: Non-return to sports was not an uncommon finding in our study participants at the end of three months. The presence of high body mass index, psychiatric morbidity, and not undergoing regular physiotherapy were the factors associated with non-return to sports in young athletes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the end of three months. ? 2025, Army Medical College.

693,SC-76,TrofŠ et al. (2025),2025,Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) Stimulation Increases Muscle Activity During Exercise in Sedentary People,"Objectives: A pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) induces electric currents in biological tissue, enhancing muscle energy expenditure during heavy constant-load exercises. In this paper, we investigate the PEMF effect on muscular activation in male sedentary people. Methods: The surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of the right leg?s vastus medialis (RVM) and biceps femoris (RBF) muscles was recorded and analyzed. The root mean square values were normalized to the peak amplitude observed during maximal voluntary contraction. Measurements were taken at baseline (stationary seated position), during warm-up (unloaded cycling), and throughout 15 min of constant-load exercise performed at moderate intensity. Subjects performed two experimental conditions, when PEMF was turned ON versus OFF. Results: No significant difference was found during the baseline. The analysis during warm-up showed significant differences between conditions (ON vs. OFF) for both muscles (RVM p = 0.019; RBF p < 0.001). The analysis during constant-load exercise showed significant differences between conditions (ON vs. OFF) for RVM only (p = 0.002). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that PEMF stimulation acutely enhances muscle activation, primarily in the vastus medialis, with a comparatively smaller effect on the biceps femoris during moderate-intensity cycling in sedentary young men. The observed increase in EMG activity suggests that PEMF may facilitate neuromuscular excitability and muscle recruitment, potentially through mechanisms related to calcium signaling and enhanced muscle perfusion. ? 2025 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/jfmk10020232,Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology

This study aimed to compare the effects of low-dye and anti-pronation taping (elastic and inelastic) on ankle strength, gait parameters, and balance control in women with flexible flat feet. Thirty women were evaluated under four conditions: no taping, low-dye taping, elastic anti-pronation taping, and inelastic anti-pronation taping. Each condition was tested at 3-day intervals. Outcome measures included ankle muscle strength, step length, stride length, balance control ability assessed using the Romberg and limits of stability tests. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc least significant difference analyses were used to determine statistical significance. Additionally, effect sizes (?2) were calculated for the primary outcomes. Dorsiflexion strength significantly improved with elastic taping (p < 0.05). Step length increased with both elastic and inelastic taping, whereas stride length improved only with elastic taping. All taping methods significantly reduced the limits of stability compared with the no-taping condition (p < 0.05). Athletic Tape interventions, especially elastic anti-pronation taping, may reduce excessive foot pronation and improve ankle strength and gait performance in women with flexible flat feet. ? 2025 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/app15126858,Applied Sciences (Switzerland)

Methods This was a single-center study conducted from June 19 through August 14, 2022, using 6 healthy donkeys. Whole blood (WB) was collected into sodium citrate vacutainer tubes for single-centrifugation processing and an acid-citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine blood bag for double-centrifugation processing to produce, respectively, PRP1 and PRP2. Platelet, WBC, and RBC concentrations and PDGF-BB and TGF-?1 activities were assessed in WB, PRP1, and PRP2. Results Both protocols concentrated platelets (PLTs) 1.8-to 5.2-fold, reduced WBCs 1.1-to 50.4-fold, and decreased RBCs at least 829-fold compared to WB. Platelet-rich plasma-2 yielded a higher PLT concentration and PLT enrichment factor than PRP1 but required resuspension of the pellet post second spin to maximize PLT concentration. Platelet-rich plasma-1 possessed a lower WBC concentration and greater WBC reduction factor than PRP2. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB and TGF-?1 activities were highest in PRP2 and not significantly different between PRP1 and WB. There was a weak and moderate correlation of baseline PLT concentration to that of PRP2 (r = 0.4) and PRP1 (r = 0.62), respectively; neither was statistically significant. Platelet-rich plasma-2 yielded higher PLT enrichment and growth factor activities despite greater WBC and RBC contamination than PRP1. Conclusions In donkeys, double centrifugation results in leukocyte-rich PRP with a higher PLT concentration compared to leukocyte-poor PRP with a lower PLT concentration yielded from single centrifugation. Clinical Relevance Asinine PRP can be manually prepared. While this improves cost-efficient field management of donkeys often treated under resource limitations, the optimal cellular composition, in vivo efficacy, and safety of asinine PRP warrant further investigation. ? 2025 THE AUTHORS.",Scopus,10.2460/ajvr.25.01.0022,American Journal of Veterinary Research

Discussion: The tibial inlay technique effectively addresses residual laxity associated with the ?killer turn? phenomenon and the autologous patella-quadriceps tendon not only maintains the integrity of the quadriceps femoris, but also mitigates the risks of quadriceps tendon rupture and patellar fracture. Conclusion: The use of modified bone-tendon tibial inlay technique can conduct the acceleration of knee joint rehabilitation post-surgery, guarantees the stability of the rebuilt ligament and have fewer complications. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111426,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports

However, the role of the ankle strategy during uneven surface walking is currently unknown, and elucidating this role could help us understand the evolution of the hominin AJC and its potential adaptive function in bipedal walking on natural terrains. Here, we collected three-dimensional kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic data from 17 human participants who walked barefoot on a flat, even surface and on an uneven surface consisting of tiered blocks of ethylene-vinyl acetate foam, with a repeating 0.8?2.4 cm height variation. We developed linear mixed-effect models, incorporating participant identity as a random effect and walking surface condition as a fixed effect. Type 3 analyses of variance were employed to evaluate differences across surface conditions. On the uneven surface, participants averaged 38% and 28% greater AJC frontal plane ranges of motion and joint moments, respectively, during the first half of the stance phase (p < 0.001) and had greater coactivation between the fibularis longus and tibialis anterior muscles during single-limb support (p < 0.02). These results suggest that AJC mobility is critical for balance on uneven surfaces, and therefore, hominins may have experienced selective pressure to maintain some of the joint compliance of more arboreally adapted ancestors. However, this retained mobility comes with the trade-off of susceptibility to joint injury, meaning that hominins must rely on muscles like the fibularis longus to stabilize the ankle when walking on natural terrains. ? 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jhevol.2025.103678,Journal of Human Evolution

(2025),2025,Comparison of all-inside and conventional tunnel reconstructions for posterior cruciate ligament injuries; ?????????????????????????,"Objective To compare the clinical outcomes between all-inside and conventional transtibial tunnel reconstructions for posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. Methods A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the clinical data of the 108 patients who had been treated for PCL injuries at Department of Arthrosis Surgery, Xuzhou Renci Hospital, from March 2021 to March 2023. There were 48 females and 60 males, with an age of (30.3ñ10.8) years and an injury-to-surgery interval of (25.7ñ6.4) days. Of them, 49 left and 59 right knees were affected. By the difference in the tunnel reconstruction, the patients were divided into 2 groups: an all-inside group (n=52) in which the PCL was reconstructed using the all-inside techniques and a conventional group in which the PCL was reconstructed using the conventional techniques. The following were observed and compared: operation time and postoperative hospital stay; visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores and Lysholm knee function scores at preoperation, postoperative 3 months and the last follow-up; posterior drawer test, posterior sag sign, reverse Lachman test and the diameter and morphology of the PCL shown by the knee joint MRI at the last follow-up. Results The baseline characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups (P>0.05). All patients were followed up for (12.3ñ1.2) months. The all-inside group incurred significantly longer operation time [(128.3ñ7.6) min] than the conventional group [(103.5ñ6.9) min] (P<0.05), but no significant difference was observed in postoperative hospital stay between the 2 groups (P> 0.05). There was no significant difference in VAS pain score, IKDC subjective score, or Lysholm score between the 2 groups at preoperation, postoperative 3 months or the last follow-up (P>0.05). In both groups, the VAS pain scores, IKDC subjective scores and Lysholm scores at postoperative 3 months and the last follow-up were significantly improved compared with those at preoperation (P<0.05). At the last follow-up, the posterior drawer test, posterior sag sign, reverse Lachman test were negative in both groups, and the knee joint MRI showed good diameter and morphology of the PCL reconstructed. Conclusions Both conventional and all-inside reconstructions yield satisfactory clinical outcomes for PCL injuries, demonstrating comparable functional recovery and complication incidence. However, the all-inside technique requires longer operation time than the conventional approach. ? 2025 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

699,SC-82,Liu et al. (2025),2025,Effects of external ankle braces on kinematics and kinetics of the lower limb during the cutting maneuver in healthy females,"Background: To explore if lace-up ankle brace and hinged ankle brace affect the kinematics and kinetics of the lower limbs during a cutting maneuver. Methods: Twenty healthy females performed a 45ø cutting maneuver with different ankle braces. Ground reaction force, lower-limb joint angles and moments were compared among different ankle braces. Results: Wearing hinged ankle brace significantly increased maximal knee valgus angle than lace-up and no brace conditions (0.7ø [p = 0.011] and 0.6ø [p = 0.029], respectively). Wearing hinged and lace-up ankle braces significantly increased maximal knee internal rotation angle (1.58ø [p ó 0.001] and 1.30ø [p = 0.020], respectively) and decreased maximal ankle inversion angle (3.04ø [p ó 0.001] and 1.76ø [p = 0.013], respectively). A considerable difference in kinetics was observed only in the maximal ankle eversion moment, which was higher in the hinged condition than the lace-up (p = 0.010) or no brace (p = 0.023) condition. Conclusion: Wearing an hinged or lace-up ankle brace may reduce the risk of ankle sprain in females during cutting maneuvers. Ankle brace appears to have upstream effects on the knee, which may have injury implication. ? 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2025.02.008,Gait and Posture

The technique involves using 2 reinforcements: one for anterolateral stabilization and the other for anteromedial stabilization. The procedure follows a detailed algorithm for diagnosing rotational instability through physical examination under anesthesia. This approach offers a solution for complex ACL injuries involving bidirectional rotational instability, aiming to optimize knee stability and reduce failure rates in ACL reconstruction. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2025.103456,Arthroscopy Techniques

Methods: Twenty participants, who play football at a university level or higher, with a history of ankle injuries were recruited. All participants performed three maximal effort 505 agility COD tests. Three-dimensional ankle range of motion (ROM, measured using inertial measurement units) and the average ankle muscle co-activation (tibialis anterior, soleus, and peroneus longus muscles of the affected limb, measured using bipolar surface electromyography) were extracted from the stance phase of the final cutting step. Fear of movement was assessed using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia 11-item (TSK-11) questionnaire. Results: TSK-11 significantly correlated with ankle transverse plane ROM: r = -0.53 (95 %CI ?0.79 to ?0.11), t = -2.63, P = 0.017. There was no significant association between the COD timed performance and the four ankle biomechanical indices. Conclusions: Greater fear of movement may result in a stiffer turning strategy, which may reduce the risk of injury to the ankle. However, fear of movement is less likely to moderate ankle kinematic and muscle activation strategies that give rise to a performance-injury conflict. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2025.01.029,Gait and Posture

(2025),2025,Concomitant osteochondral lesion of the talus in ankle instability: Utilizing clinical presentation to guide imaging decision,"Low ankle sprains are a prevalent issue, often involving the anterior talofibular ligament. While there is increased attention placed on ligamentous injuries in ankle sprains, concomitant cartilaginous injuries are frequently overlooked. This article aims to (Park et al., 2021) evaluate the significance of magnetic resonance imaging in anterior talofibular ligament injuries to detect concurrent osteochondral lesions of the talus as well as other associated ligamentous injuries; (H?lmer et al., 1994) determine the importance of clinical presentation and its association with the risk of concomitant osteochondral lesions in anterior talofibular ligament injuries. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 129 patients who underwent anterior talofibular ligament reconstruction, reviewing patient data to assess the incidence of osteochondral lesions of the talus and associated ligamentous injuries. Clinical presentations were then reviewed to identify signs and symptoms associated with the occurrence of osteochondral lesions of the talus. The results indicated that calcaneofibular ligament was most injured in association with anterior talofibular ligament injuries (69.52 %; n = 73). Furthermore. 31.78 % (n = 41) of patients with anterior talofibular ligament injuries had concurrent osteochondral lesion of the talus. Analysis on clinical presentation revealed statistical significance (p < .001) between patients that had ankle joint line tenderness lasting for more than 6 weeks and the occurrence of osteochondral lesions of the talus. This study concludes that magnetic resonance imaging could be beneficial in anterior talofibular ligament injuries with patients exhibiting persistent joint line tenderness to evaluate for osteochondral lesions to ensure a comprehensive pre-operative assessment. ? 2024",Scopus,10.1053/j.jfas.2024.10.011,Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery
705,SC-88,Kazemi et al. (2025),2025,The Effect of Additional Neuromuscular Training on Peri-Ankle Muscle Morphology and Function in Chronic Ankle Instability Subjects: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Lateral ankle sprain is one of the most common musculoskeletal issues during sports and activities of daily living. This study investigated the effect of combined neuromuscular training and conventional training (including strengthening, range of motion, and balance exercises) on muscle morphology, dynamic balance, perceived ankle instability, and functional capacity in persons with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Hypothesis: The combination of neuromuscular and conventional training programs might result in additional benefits on the morphology of muscle, dynamic balance, and functional capacity in subjects with CAI. Study Design: A single-blind parallel-arm randomized controlled trial. Level of Evidence: Level 2. Methods: A total of 34 participants with CAI were divided randomly into experimental (EG) and control groups (CG). The EG received conventional and neuromuscular training, while the CG underwent conventional training. Cross-sectional areas of the peroneus longus and tibialis anterior muscles were measured using ultrasonography. Measurements included reaching direction distance, ankle instability, and the foot and ankle outcome score, all evaluated before and immediately after 12 intervention sessions and 4 weeks later in the follow-up phase. Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant improvement in the EG, particularly in the cross-sectional area of the tibialis anterior muscle on the injured side and the posteromedial reaching direction displacement of the Y balance test. Moreover, the EG?s foot and ankle outcome scores increased significantly compared with the CG (P < 0.05). However, the group effect size ranged from minor to moderate (Hedges g, 0.40-0.73). Conclusion: Combining neuromuscular and conventional training programs yields greater benefits than conventional training alone regarding tibialis anterior muscle morphology, posteromedial dynamic balance, and functional capacity in persons with CAI. Clinical Relevance: The combination of neuromuscular and conventional training programs could enhance muscle morphology, dynamic balance, perceived ankle instability, and functional capacity in persons with CAI. ? 2024 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/19417381241258467,Sports Health
706,SC-89,Dreher et al. (2025),2025,Reinforced lengthening Achilles tendon Z-plasty ? ex vivo assessment of biomechanical augmentation with surgical-fiberlock technology,"Purpose: Tendon lengthening is a common lower limb surgical procedure in paediatric orthopaedics and deformity correction. Healing of a lengthened tendon is typically supported by casting and unloading of the operated limb. Although tendon rupture or overcorrection may adversely affect surgical outcomes, few studies have examined surgical means of improving post-operative stability of the tendon. We aim to evaluate a novel method for augmenting Z-Plasty tendon lengthening as a first step to clinical translation. Methods: In this experimental ex vivo study, we employed a bovine flexor tendon model (n = 18) to examine a novel mechanical augmentation method after tendon lengthening by Z-plasty. Conventional surgical suturing of the imposed Z-plasty (n = 6) and an experimental group (n = 6), in which additional augmentation was performed by interlocking fibres of a biomaterial scaffold to the underlying tendon using a novel micro-needling technique, were compared to native tendons (n = 6). Results: The needle interlocked scaffold successfully augmented the suture repair, showing more than doubled ultimate failure force compared to controls (482 ñ 107 N vs. 206 ñ 37 N, p < 0.01), and more than 1.5-fold repair stiffness (41 ñ 7 N/mm vs. 26 ñ 9 N/mm, p < 0.01). Conclusion: We conclude that the use of an interpenetrating biomaterial scaffold represents a promising new approach for improving biomechanical tendon properties, which may have an implication on the stability of tendon suture, lengthening and tendon transfer procedures as well as on post-operative management and earlier mobilization. ?

707,SC-90,da Silva et al. (2025),2025,Inframalleolar harvest of the peroneus longus tendon graft: Surgical technique,"Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft has recently gained visibility in the literature as a promising option for knee ligament reconstructions. The most used harvesting technique is performed with a single incision posterior to the lateral malleolus, with large series reporting tendon lengths enough to prepare a double or triple anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, resulting in mean diameters greater than 8.0 mm. However, as happens with the hamstrings, some patients may present PLT grafts with a 7-mm diameter, which is associated with higher failure rates and is the minimum acceptable diameter for ACL reconstructions. In turn, the 2-incision technique has longer graft lengths reported, enough to prepare 4-folded grafts, with mean diameters above 9.0 mm, ranging from 8.5 to 10 mm. Once the PLT graft diameter has a direct correlation with anthropometric measurements, as well as larger ACL graft diameters are associated with lower failure rates and revision surgeries, the inframalleolar harvesting seems to be a reasonable option, especially for short-stature patients with a greater risk of insufficient grafts. Additionally, patients who benefit from an extra-articular procedure can have a combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament using the PLT graft with the two-incision technique, with no need for another graft. Therefore, this article aims to describe the step-by-step technique for the inframalleolar PLT harvesting. ? 2025 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.jisako.2025.100384,Journal of ISAKOS

Purpose: To unveil the efficacy of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) with modern rehabilitation techniques in AIS patients with post-motor dysfunction. Material and Methods: A total of 200 AIS patients with post-motor dysfunction were divided into groups A, B, C, and D (n = 50). Patients in the four groups were routinely treated with medicine, on this basis: group B received NMES treatment; group C received modern rehabilitation technology treatment; and group D was treated with NMES and modern rehabilitation technology. Rehabilitation effect, cerebral hemodynamic indices, neurological function recovery, Fugl?Meyer Assessment (FMA) and Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) scores, self-care, and quality of life were compared. Results: After treatment, the total effective rate of group D was 96% higher than that of group A (64%), group B (82%), and group C (84%). Bilateral middle cerebral artery Vm and Vs and scores of FMA, MAS, functional independence measure, and modified Barthel index increased; RI and NHISS scores decreased; and all group D improved significantly versus groups A, B, and C, and both groups B and C improved significantly versus group A. Conclusion: NMES with modern rehabilitation technologies synergistically treat motor dysfunction after AIS with ideal rehabilitation effect, improving cerebral hemodynamics, neurological and limb motor function recovery, and self-care ability and quality of life. ?

(2025),2025,Utility of preoperative ultrasound in assessing the adequacy of autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using tendon autograft requires imaging to evaluate graft adequacy. Ultrasound (US) offers an efficient adjunct to MRI; however, the utility of US is variable in prior literature and should be investigated. The primary aim of this study is to provide a statistical appraisal of literature assessing correlation of preoperative US measurements with intraoperative size of autografts during ACL reconstruction. Materials and methods: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried for studies comparing preoperative US-based measurements to intraoperative measurements of autografts to assess graft adequacy (defined as > 8ÿmm diameter). Correlation coefficients from studies comparing combined cross-sectional area (CCSA) of autograft tendons on US to intraoperative autograft tendon diameters were collected and pooled. Random-effects models were generated to compare sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the identification of adequate graft sizes. Results: Eleven studies compared preoperative measurements of autograft size to intraoperative measurements. Meta-analysis of studies assessing hamstring tendon CCSA on US in comparison to intraoperative tendon diameters revealed a pooled correlation coefficient of 0.54 (CI 0.41?0.66, I2 = 9.6%). Three studies reported if US correctly identified adequate graft sizes, demonstrating sensitivity of 83% (I2 = 0.0%) and specificity of 78% (I2 = 49.2%). PPV was 91% (I2 = 0.0%), and NPV was 62% (I2 = 11.7%). Conclusion: Hamstring CCSA on US has moderate correlation with intraoperative diameter, high sensitivity (83%), moderate specificity (78%), and very high PPV (91%) for identifying adequately sized autografts for ACL reconstruction. ?

Displacement of this fracture frequently indicates a surgical treatment to restore posterior cruciate ligament function. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, either open or arthroscopic, which can be tricky due to the fracture's proximity to the popliteal vascular-nervous elements. Badet's open approach is a medial trans-gastrocnemius approach, providing a direct access to the retro-spinal surface for osteosynthesis. In this technique, an L-shaped incision is made along precise skin lines, followed by discision of the muscle fibers. The capsule is then approached, allowing a view of the retro-spinal surface protected from the popliteal vasculo-nervous elements by the muscular lateral lip of the gastrocnemius. A reduction followed by screw osteosynthesis is usually performed, allowing early mobilization of the patient. In this technical note, we describe the Badet approach supporting by video and case series.

Djamil Central General Hospital Padang 2020-2022,"Background: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the main stabilizer of the knee joint. The incidence of ACL injuries is quite high, especially in individuals who participate in sports. ACL injuries result in knee instability, hindering daily activities and sports participation. This study aimed to determine the functional outcomes of patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction. Methods: This study was descriptive, with a cross-sectional approach, and used medical record data from Dr. M. Djamil Central General Hospital Padang. The total sampling technique was used from patients after ACL reconstruction in 2020-2022. Patients with bilateral knee injuries, multiple ligament injuries, or revision reconstruction were excluded from the study. The samples were contacted to determine their functional outcome by filling out the Lysholm Knee Score. Results: This study analyzed 27 patients, with 77.8% in the 19-44 age group, and no patients were over 60 years old. This study identified 85.2% of male patients with sports-related injuries being the most common (70.4%). The non-dominant knee was injured more frequently (51.9%). Functional outcomes, as assessed by the Lysholm Knee Score, showed excellent, good, and moderate results in 37 %, 29.6%, and 33.3% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: ACL reconstruction was most frequently performed in the adult population aged 19?44 years, predominantly in males. Sports-related injuries were the primary cause, with the majority of reconstructions involving the non-dominant knee. The average patient achieved good functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction. ? 2025, Airlangga University.

Methods A total 46 individuals with FAI were randomly divided into ankle focus group, free focus group and control group. The ankle focus group and FFG performed Tai Chi practice for 10 weeks; the ankle focus group focused their attention on the ankle joint, while the free focus group didn?t require attention focus; the control group maintained the origin lifestyle and didn?t engage in special physical activities. The three-dimensional force plate and Y balance test (YBT) were used to evaluate the static (with eyes open and closed) and dynamic (instant and continuous) balance ability of individuals with FAI. Results For ankle focus group and free focus group, the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) sway distances of center of pressure (COP) in single-leg stance (SLS) with eyes open and closed were significantly reduced, and the reach distance in YBT in three directions were increased. For the ankle focus group, the medial lateral stability index and the dynamic postural stability index were significantly reduced during single-leg drop landing. The ankle focus group and free focus group got significantly smaller ML COP sway distance than control group in SLS with eyes open; the ankle focus group got significantly smaller ML COP sway distance than free focus group and control group in SLS with eyes closed; and reach distance of ankle focus group in posterior-medial & posterior-lateral direction in YBT was longer than of free focus group and control group. Conclusions Tai Chi practice can comprehensively improve static and dynamic balance control ability of the individuals with FAI in SLS, and ankle attention-focused Tai Chi practice is more effective, especially for the enhancement of their medial-lateral control ability in closed-eye static and continuous dynamic SLS. ? 2025 Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

(2025),2025,Peroneus Longus to Peroneus Brevis Tenodesis Does Not Improve Ankle Functional Outcomes: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Purpose: Peroneus longus (PL) graft harvest has recently gained popularity for various ligament reconstruction surgeries. A recent systematic review shows it is a safe and reproducible technique with low morbidity of donor sites (1). The method for PL harvest routinely involves tenodesis of the PL stump to the peroneus brevis (PB). To the authors? best knowledge, no study exists in the literature that has compared the outcomes of tenodesis versus no tenodesis on post-operative ankle functional outcome scores. The purpose of the present study is to assess the importance of tenodesis on post-operative ankle scores. Methods: A total of 200 consecutive patients from July 2022 to November 2022 were included in the study: 72 in the no tenodesis group and 128 in the tenodesis group. Institutional ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics review committee before the initiation of the study. Demographic variables (age, gender and level of play) were recorded. Pre-operative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) and Functional Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were calculated for both groups and compared with post-operative scores at six weeks, three months, six months and one-year follow-up. Results: For the entire study population (n = 200), we found that AOFAS and FADI scores showed no significant difference at any interval except for lower scores at six weeks of follow-up for both groups compared to baseline. We found that the no tenodesis group had slightly better AOFAS and FADI scores at the six-week follow-up, which were statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, the magnitude of variance (0.13 and 0.20, respectively) was too small to be clinically significant. Age, gender and level of play had no impact on ankle functional outcomes. Conclusion: Tenodesis of the PL to the PB has been the standard norm in PL graft harvest for various ligament surgeries. The present high-powered prospective cohort study shows that tenodesis. does not improve ankle functional outcome scores compared to no tenodesis. Further work is needed to assess the impact of tenodesis or no tenodesis on ankle biomechanics (eversion, plantarflexion and gait). Level of evidence: IV ?

Tendon transfer seems to be a feasible treatment option for this age group. Biomechanical studies have shown that lower trapezius tendon transfer, rather than latissimus dorsi tendon transfer, could restore the kinematics of the shoulder. Purpose: To evaluate the functional outcome, efficacy, and safety of arthroscopy-assisted lower trapezius transfer with peroneus longus augmentation for irreparable posterior superior rotator cuff tears. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: This study included 20 patients who had massive rotator cuff tears, symptomatic global shoulder pain, and the inability to move their upper limbs actively. The patients were examined by manual testing using a goniometer, and the study had a follow-up period of at least 24 months. Results: The mean age of the patients was 53.4 ñ 4.3 years (range, 40-60 years). Thirteen patients had associated biceps pathology. The mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score improved from 22.88 ñ 7.25 preoperatively to 84.44 ñ 4.54 postoperative (P <.001). The mean visual analog scale improved from 7.9 ñ 1.33 preoperatively to 2.7 ñ 1.3 postoperatively (P <.001). All patients regained a good functional range of shoulder motion at the end of the follow-up without major shoulder complications. Conclusion: Arthroscopy-assisted lower trapezius transfer with peroneus longus augmentation for irreparable rotator cuff tear is advisable because it shows marked improvement in the functional outcome and range of motion without major complications. ?

With the ankle being the most commonly injured joint in runners, rigid tape (RT) and Kinesiotape (KT) have been proposed as effective methods to improve joint stability and reduce injury risk. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of a KT and RT and no tape (control group) on lower limb balance, ankle dorsiflexion ROM, and electromyographic (EMG) activation of the pronator and supinator muscles of the ankle during a Single Leg Drop Jump (SLDJ) following a treadmill fatigue protocol. From March 1st until April 10th, 2024, a cross-over clinical trial with three conditions: control group, with a RT, and with KT was conducted with n?=?22 well-trained runners aged 29.29 ñ? 10.98 years. Lower limb stability, ankle dorsiflexion mobility, SLDJ parameters, and electromyographic activation of the ankle muscles (tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), peroneus longus (PL), and medial gastrocnemius (MG)) during a SLDJ were analyzed Pre and Post fatigue protocol, involving a 30-minute run at 85% of the maximal aerobic speed on a treadmill. Statistical analysis was conducted using repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. The RT bandage decreased ankle dorsiflexion ROM compared to both KT bandage and a control group during pre fatigue treadmill protocol measurements in the lunge and Y Balance Tests (specifically in the anterior direction). Group-by-time interaction showed significant differences for the lunge test (p =? 0.045), SLDJ height (p =? 0.014), flight time (p =? 0.019) and ground contact time (p =? 0.035). With the RT condition, the runners exhibited higher peak activation of the EDL muscle compared to the KT and control group during initial landing (p =? 0.028), with a lesser decay in activation during take-off (p =? 0.016). The KT showed a significant increase in the activation of the PL muscle during the first contact phase of the SLDJ (p =? 0.046). Concerning flight and contact time during the SLDJ, both KT and RT proved beneficial in mitigating fatigue symptoms before and after the treadmill protocol. Regarding the RT bandage?s specific effects on muscle activation, our findings indicate that the RT group exhibited higher peak activation of the EDL muscle compared to the KT and control groups during initial landing, with a lesser decay in activation during take-off. The KT showed a significant increase in the activation of the PL muscle during the first contact phase of the SLDJ. To conclude, our study highlights the potential benefits of both KT and RT in reducing fatigue symptoms during SLDJ.

(2025),2025,Enhancing ACL reconstruction: augmented hamstring allograft with high-strength sutures for superior graft stability,"The conventional autograft technique for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction poses challenges such as donor site morbidity and postoperative pain. This technique introduces an augmented allograft technique using high-strength sutures to enhance graft stability and healing. The method involves preparing a semitendinosus and gracilis allograft. This technique reduces donor site morbidity, preserves the patient's natural anatomy, and may allow for faster rehabilitation. Additionally, it decreases the chance of contralateral injuries and graft re-rupture, enhancing ACL strength and knee stability. The augmented allograft with high-strength suture presents a promising alternative for ACL reconstruction, offering increased graft strength and knee stability while avoiding complications associated with autograft harvesting. ? 2025 Published by Oxford University Press and JSCR Publishing Ltd.",Scopus,10.1093/jscr/rjaf013,Journal of Surgical Case Reports

(2025),2025,Harvesting the Full Thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Is Not Associated With Structural Foot Impairments: A 12- to 23-Year Follow-up Study,"Background: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft is suggested as a promising alternative graft option for reconstructive procedures supported by a growing body of evidence indicating favorable results. However, concerns remain regarding long-term functional impairments of the foot and ankle after harvesting a full-thickness PLT. Purpose: To evaluate long-term donor site morbidity in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a PLT autograft. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with harvested PLT autografts, and all eligible patients were invited to participate in a clinical examination at the hospital. To evaluate their range of motion, all included patients underwent a physical examination. Clinical outcomes were measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Activities of Daily Living and Sports subscales of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-ADL and FAAM-S). To evaluate foot and ankle structural changes, the intermetatarsal angle (IMA), hallux valgus angle (HVA), arc height index (AHI), lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (LTFMA), calcaneal pitch angle (CPA), and metatarsal angle (MA) were measured in the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side. Results: A total of 26 patients who were available for the final follow-up were included in this study. The mean age of the patients at the final follow-up was 45.7 ñ 9.5 years. The mean follow-up time was 19.5 ñ 3.4 years. AOFAS scores were excellent in 92.3% of patients (n = 24) and good in 7.7% (n = 2). The mean FAAM-ADL score was 99.6 ñ 1.86. The mean FAAM-S score was 98.1 ñ 5.94. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side for any of the measured parameters?including the IMA, HVA, AHI, LTFMA, CPA, and MA. Conclusion: This study demonstrated good to excellent long-term patient-reported outcomes and negligible radiographic changes after harvesting the full thickness PLT compared with the contralateral side. These long-term data strongly support PLT harvesting as an alternative graft choice and suggest that this method does not alter the natural history of foot and ankle structures. ?

(2025),2025,Reconstruction of the sMCL for the surgical treatment of anteromedial instability of the knee joint; Rekonstruktion des sMCL zur operativen Behandlung der anteromedialen Instabilit„t des Kniegelenks,"Ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament are often associated with concomitant injuries to the medial capsule-ligamentous complex. An anteromedial rotational instability may result, leading to increased anterior translation of the medial tibial plateau. Biomechanical studies have shown that the sMCL and dMCL, in particular, play a significant role in the anteromedial rotational instability. In such cases, isolated treatment of the central pillar seems insufficient. Therefore, additional stabilization of the medial capsule-ligamentous complex should be considered to prevent, among other things, early graft failure.In the present case, anteromedial rotational instability was treated with a minimally invasive single-strand reconstruction of the sMCL. The patient showed a satisfactory outcome both in the knee scores and clinical examination at the one-year follow-up. ?

(2025),2025,A low-profile all-suture anchor construct provides comparable fixation to both spiked washer and bone staple for tibial-sided medial collateral ligament reconstruction: A cadaveric biomechanical study,"Objectives: To compare the biomechanical performance of an all-suture anchor construct to that of both a spiked washer and cancellous screw, and a bone staple in tibial-sided superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) reconstruction. Methods: A time-zero cadaveric biomechanical study was conducted using 24 human cadaveric tibia, with fresh-frozen peroneus longus allografts used for an sMCL reconstruction. Specimens were randomized to one of three treatment groups for tibial fixation being an all-suture anchor construct, spiked washer, or bone staple. A servohydraulic uniaxial testing machine was used to assess elongation after 1000 cycles at 20?50N, maximum load-to-failure (LTF), elongation at maximum LT, and modes of failure. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: No statistically significant differences were observed across the groups. Mean elongation after cyclic loading was 1.1 ?ñ ?0.7 ?mm in the all-suture anchor group, 0.6 ?ñ ?1.2 ?mm in the spiked washer group, and 1.1 ?ñ ?0.6 ?mm in the staple group (p ?= ?0.732). Mean maximum LTF was 132.1 ?ñ ?40.2N for the all-suture anchor group, 120.8 ?ñ ?54.9N for the spiked washer group, and 123.9 ?ñ ?64.1N for the staple group (p ?= ?0.605). Mean elongation at maximum LTF was 8.6 ?ñ ?4.1 ?mm for the all-suture anchor group, 8.7 ?ñ ?5.4 ?mm for the spiked washer group, and 10.8 ?ñ ?6.3 ?mm for the staple group (p ?= ?0.605). The mode of failure for all specimens was tendon pullout. Conclusion: The all-suture anchor construct demonstrated comparable performance to both the spiked washer and bone staple for tibial-sided sMCL reconstruction in this time-zero cadaveric biomechanical assessment.

720,SC-103,Adi et al. (2025),2025,"Management of a complex multiligament knee injury: Simultaneous reconstruction of ACL, PCL, and both meniscal roots","Introduction: Multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs) can lead to severe complications like early osteoarthritis and functional loss. Meniscal root tears further increase these risks. This study reports the first documented case of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and dual meniscal root injuries, emphasizing the unique surgical and rehabilitative challenges involved. Presentation of case: A 19-year-old male presented with persistent knee pain and instability seven months after a traumatic injury from a major fall. Examination revealed a range of motion of 0?120 degrees, no swelling or tenderness, but a positive recurvatum over 10 degrees, indicating significant instability. Lachman's, McMurray's, pivot shift, and both anterior and posterior drawer tests were positive. Discussion: The radiography of the right knee revealed no fractures. The MRI confirmed injuries to the ACL, PCL, and the posterior roots of both the lateral and medial menisci. The patient received surgical intervention. Grafts were obtained: the peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and a hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The ACL and PCL reconstructions were subsequently performed utilizing an all-inside technique, and both posterior roots of the lateral and medial menisci were repaired. Postoperative care included knee immobilization and a progressive rehabilitation program. Conclusion: Effective management of multiple ligament knee injuries necessitates a comprehensive approach, including precise identification and treatment of all torn ligaments, accurate graft placement, and robust fixation. Simultaneous reconstruction reduces hospital stays, anaesthesia exposure, and surgical risks while streamlining rehabilitation, enabling quicker patient recovery and improved outcomes. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.ijscr.2025.111150,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports

Methods A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the clinical data of 13 patients with open tibial fracture of Gustilo-Anderson ?B with segmental bone defects who had been admitted to Department of Orthopeadics, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University from January 2021 to May 2023. There were 9 males and 4 females with an age of (36.9ñ9.3) years. The length of tibial defects after debridement was (8.1ñ2.8) cm, and the area of soft-tissue defects 95.0 (53.6, 202.0) cm2. At the first stage, Masquelet technique was used, soft-tissue defects were covered simultaneously or step by step, skin grafting was conducted on the donor site surface simultaneously, and survival of the tissue and skin grafts was observed. At the second stage, intramedullary space occupation with bone cement rods was conducted using improved bone grafting for which iliac bone, artificial bone, platelet rich plasma (PRP), and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) were mixed; internal fixation was replaced. The interval between 2 stages of surgery was 4 to 7 weeks. The occurrence of infection, bone defect healing time, knee Lysholm score, ankle Mazur score, and knee and ankle ranges of motion at the last follow-up were recorded. The knee and ankle function scores before the second stage bone grafting and at the last follow-up were compared. Results After the first-stage surgery, all the 13 patients did not need any revision with fine wound healing. After the second-stage surgery, all patients were followed up for (14.9ñ4.4) months with no infection at all. The healing time for bone defects was 8.0 (6.0, 12.0) months. At the last follow-up, the knee Lysholm score and the ankle Mazur score were (77.2ñ5.2) points and (76.1ñ10.9) points respectively, significantly different from those before the second-stage bone grafting [(41.3ñ7.5) points and (37.4ñ5.2) points] (P<0.05). In the 13 patients at the last follow-up, ankle dorsiflexion limitation was 5.0ø (0, 10.0ø), knee flexion 105.0øñ9.6ø, and knee extension limitation 5.0ø (5.0ø, 5.0ø). Conclusion In the treatment of open tibial fractures of Gustilo-Anderson ?B with segmental bone defects, Masquelet technique combined with improved bone grafting can effectively prevent infection, repair bone defects, and restore the function of lower extremities, leading to definite curative efficacy. ? 2025 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

722,SC-105,Nozu et al. (2025),2025,Postural control strategies in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability during the reach phase of the posteromedial direction of the star excursion balance test,"Objective: To compare center of mass (COM) and center of pressure (COP) displacement, joint angles, and muscle activity for the ankle, knee, and hip during the posteromedial (PM) reach direction of the Star Excursion Balance Test between individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and healthy individuals. Design: Cross-sectional Study. Setting: Biomechanics laboratory. Participants: Fifteen individuals with CAI (age: 20.0 ñ 1.2 y) and 20 healthy individuals (age: 20.6 ñ 0.8 y). Main outcome measures: The maximum reach distance (MRD). The COM and COP displacement, and ankle, knee, and hip joint angles of the stance limb during the PM reach task measured via a 3D motion analysis system. Electromyography (EMG) was also recorded during the task from the tibialis anterior (TA), soleus, peroneus longus, vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris, and gluteus medius muscles. Results: MRD of the CAI group was shorter than the healthy group (P = 0.005). The CAI group showed higher COM positioning (P = 0.007), less knee flexion (P = 0.009), and lower muscle activity in TA (P = 0.04), and VM (P = 0.007) during performance of the PM reach as compared to the healthy group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that individuals with CAI demonstrate altered postural control strategies during PM reach performance, likely contributing to a shorter MRD. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2024.12.008,Physical Therapy in Sport
723,SC-106,Farago et al. (2025),2025,Changes in the mechanical properties of tibialis anterior and peroneus longus allograft depending on sterilization method and storage time,"Aims The aim of the present research was to analyze the effects of different sterilization methods and storage times on the mechanical properties (load at first break, strain at first break, maximum load, strain at maximum load, and Young?s modulus of elasticity) of different allografts compared to native groups. Methods Two types of grafts were harvested from human cadavers: 165 tibialis anterior (TA) and 166 peroneus longus (PL) tendons. According to the two types of sterilization methods (? and electron beam irradiation) or the lack of one, and the six types of storage time (one to six months), 36 groups were created. In addition, we created a 1 to 1 native group, which was not sterilized and stored, tested within four hours of collection. Results In the results of tendon type TA compared to TA native group, we observed significant differences at the fifth month of storage for all measured parameters. Load at first break of the frozen values at the fifth month was significantly inferior to the native group (p = 0.034). For strain at first break and strain at maximum load, all sterilization methods were significantly inferior at the fifth month (p = 0.003 to p = 0.009). Maximum load values were significantly superior with E-beam irradiation at the fifth month (p = 0.003), and also significantly higher with ? irradiation at the fifth month (p = 0.009). Young?s modulus showed significantly inferior values in the frozen tendons at the fifth month (p = 0.001 to p = 0.003). In tendon type PL, no significant differences were found for any of the tested parameters compared to the native group. Conclusion Our results indicate that freezing alters mechanical properties via the decrease seen in the ultimate tensile strength. In addition, at the fifth and sixth months of storage, time could notably affect allografts rather than the sterilization procedures. ? 2025 Farag¢ et al.",Scopus,10.1302/2046-3758.143.BJR-2024-0129.R2,Bone and Joint Research

Materials and methods: All the 18 patients underwent arthroscopic single-stage revision ACLR using autologous PLT with an additional modified Limier LET procedure. Patients were thoroughly assessed pre-and post-operatively by the Lachman test, the pivot shift test, and the side-to-side difference by the Rolimeter. Functional evaluation was done with the help of the Lysholm score, the IKDC subjective score, Tegner score, VAS score, MARX activity rating scale and The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. Post-operatively, patient satisfaction, return to sport, and physical activity were also recorded. SPSS ver. 22.0 software was used. Wilcoxon test, paired and unpaired t-tests were used to compare variables. Statistical significance was determined by a two-sided p-value <0.05. Results: Regarding subjective evaluations; post-operative residual laxity, and return to sport and physical activity, all of the patients demonstrated excellent results. Post-operatively, there was significant improvement in the anterior knee laxity. According to the Marx Activity Rating Scale, the extent of sports engagement was significantly increased at 18 months following surgery (p<0.001). According to the AOFAS score (p=0.38), there were no documented significant donor site morbidities. Conclusions: Single-stage revision ACLR using PLT with an additional modified Lemaire LET procedure results in a significant reduction in residual knee laxity with good clinical outcomes and a high return to play and physical activity. ? 2025, Malaysian Orthopaedic Association.

725,SC-108,Alaiti et al. (2025),2025,Predicting ACL Reconstruction Failure with Machine Learning: Development of Machine Learning Prediction Models,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is the predominant and widely accepted treatment modality for ACL injury. However, recurrence of ACL rupture or failure of the reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Despite several studies in the literature that have developed prediction models to address this issue by identifying prognostic factors for treatment outcomes using classical statistical methods, the predictive efficacy of these models is frequently suboptimal. Purpose: To (1) evaluate the predictive performance of different machine learning algorithms for the occurrence of failure in ACLR and (2) identify the most relevant predictors associated with this outcome. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 680 patients who underwent ACLR between January 2012 and July 2021 were evaluated. The study outcome was ACLR failure?defined as a complete tear confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, arthroscopy, or clinical ACL insufficiency?evaluated at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Routinely collected data were used to train 9 machine learning algorithms?including k-nearest neighbors classifier, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, extra trees classifier, gradient boosting classifier, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, CatBoost classifier, and logistic regression. A random sample of 70% of patients was used to train the algorithms, and 30% were left for performance assessment, simulating new data. The performance of the models was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The predictive performance of most models was good, with AUCs ranging from 0.71 to 0.85. The models with the best AUC metric were the CatBoost classifier (0.85 [95% CI, 0.81-0.89]) and the random forest classifier (0.84 [95% CI, 0.77-0.90). Knee hyperextension consistently emerged as the primary predictor for ACLR failure across all models subjected to our analysis. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms demonstrated good performance in predicting ACLR failure. Moreover, knee hyperextension consistently emerged as the primary predictor for failure across all models subjected to our analysis. Clinical Relevance: The findings of this study highlight the potential of machine learning as a valuable clinical tool for decision-making on surgical intervention. By offering nuanced insights, these algorithms may contribute to the evolving landscape of orthopaedic practice. Also, this study confirms knee hyperextension as an important risk factor for ACLR failure. ? The Author(s) 2025.",Scopus,10.1177/23259671251324519,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine

Objective:?: To evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of a modified procedure of superior capsule reconstruction (mSCR) employing the autologous peroneus longus tendon for the treatment of irreparable massive rotator-cuff tears (IMRCTs), encompassing the entire supraspinatus tendon and 50% of the infraspinatus tendon. Methods:?: Seven cadaveric specimens were tested at 0ø, 30ø, and 60ø glenohumeral abduction under the following three conditions: (1) intact, (2) IMRCT, and (3) mSCR using the autologous peroneus longus tendon. Humeral rotational range of motion (ROM), superior translation of the humeral head, and subacromial contact pressure were measured. Repeated-measures ANOVA was followed by Tukey's post hoc test to perform statistical analyses. Results:?: At all the abduction angles, superior translation of the humeral head and subacromial contact pressure were higher in the IMRCT group than in the intact group but were significantly lower in the mSCR group than in the IMRCT group. All these differences were statistically significant (P?<?0.05). Conclusion:?: The mSCR procedure can reduce the superior translation of the humeral head and subacromial contact pressure without limiting humeral ROM in IMRCTs. Utilizing mSCR with the peroneus longus tendon may serve as a therapeutic approach for IMRCTs. ?

The original LaPrade anatomic reconstruction technique using 2 allografts from a split Achilles tendon has become a well-recognized reconstructive approach for addressing injury to the PLC. In this article, we present our modified technique of anatomic PLC reconstruction using a single tibialis allograft and suspensory tibial fixation. We describe the tunnel position, graft passage, and fixation strategies to achieve anatomic reconstruction of the 3 main stabilizers of the PLC (fibular collateral ligament, popliteus tendon, and popliteofibular ligament) while using a single allograft tendon. Suspensory fixation on the tibia is used to allow for individual tensioning of each limb of the reconstruction in an optimal knee position. We review the associated advantages, challenges, and technical pearls and pitfalls associated with our technique. We consider this modified approach a viable alternative to achieve a stable PLC reconstruction while still abiding by the established core anatomic reconstructive principles. ? 2024 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2024.103265,Arthroscopy Techniques

(2025),2025,Application of Interpretable Machine Learning Models to Predict the Risk Factors of HBV-Related Liver Cirrhosis in CHB Patients Based on Routine Clinical Data: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection represents a significant global public health issue, often leading to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) with poor prognoses. Early identification of HBV-LC risk is essential for timely intervention. This study develops and compares nine machine learning (ML) models to predict HBV-LC risk in CHB patients using routine clinical and laboratory data. A retrospective analysis was conducted involving 777 CHB patients, with 50.45% (392/777) progressing to HBV-LC. Admission data consisted of 52 clinical and laboratory variables, with missing values addressed using multiple imputation. Feature selection utilized Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm, identifying 24 key variables. The evaluated ML models included XGBoost, logistic regression (LR), LightGBM, random forest (RF), AdaBoost, Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The data set was partitioned into an 80% training set (n = 621) and a 20% independent testing set (n = 156). Cross-validation (CV) facilitated hyperparameter tuning and internal validation of the optimal model. Performance metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Brier score, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The RF model demonstrated superior performance, with AUCs of 0.992 (training) and 0.907 (validation), while the reconstructed model achieved AUCs of 0.944 (training) and 0.945 (validation), maintaining an AUC of 0.863 in the testing set. Calibration curves confirmed a strong alignment between observed and predicted probabilities. Decision curve analysis indicated that the RF model provided the highest net benefit across threshold probabilities. The SHAP algorithm identified RPR, PLT, HBV DNA, ALT, and TBA as critical predictors. This interpretable ML model enhances early HBV-LC prediction and supports clinical decision-making in resource-limited settings. ? 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Scopus,10.1002/jmv.70302,Journal of Medical Virology
730,SC-113,Beason et al. (2025),2025,Is Ulnar Collateral Ligament Strength Proportional to Height and Weight?,"Background: The rates of surgeries for ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries continue to rise for baseball pitchers. The physical size of pitchers has also increased, bringing into question whether today?s larger pitchers have proportionally bigger and stronger UCLs able to withstand greater elbow varus torque. Furthermore, controversy exists in biomechanics literature regarding whether kinetics during pitching should be reported as torque (in Núm) or normalized torque (scaled by body weight and height). Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to quantify the relationships between body size and mechanical properties of the UCL measured directly on cadaveric specimens. It was hypothesized that greater body weight and height would correlate with greater UCL strength, stiffness, and cross-sectional area. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: UCL thickness and length were measured by ultrasound for 20 cadaveric right elbows from young adult (mean age, 33 ñ 6 years) male donors. Each elbow was then dissected, potted, and placed into a mechanical test frame at 90ø of flexion. The specimen was then tested to failure at a rate of 1ø of valgus rotation per second. Correlations between geometric and biomechanical data were tested by linear regressions (P <.05). Results: The mean UCL failure torque was 45.0 ñ 10.5 Núm, and the mean stiffness was 2.72 ñ 0.48 Núm/deg. Correlations between failure torque and height (P =.25), weight (P =.85), and height ? weight (P =.72) were nonsignificant. Similarly, stiffness showed no significant correlation with height (P =.24), weight (P =.21), or height ? weight (P =.18). UCL cross-sectional area did not significantly correlate with body height (P =.34), height ? weight (P =.064), or weight (P =.065). Conclusion: Body size is not correlated with UCL strength and stiffness. Clinical Relevance: Clinicians should not assume that bigger athletes have a stronger UCL. Furthermore, elbow varus torque during throwing for adult athletes should not be normalized by body weight and height. ?

731,SC-114,Metze et al. (2025),2025,Effects of Protamine Reversal on Coagulation Parameters After High-Dose Heparin Administration in Percutaneous Hepatic Chemosaturation Intervention,"Background: Intravenous protamine administration for heparin reversal after percutaneous hepatic chemosaturation intervention is generally recommended, but its effectiveness on coagulation parameters remains unclear. Methods: In a single-center retrospective observational study, the effects of different postinterventional protamine doses on the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, platelet count (PLT), and hemoglobin (Hb) were analyzed in consecutive patients who underwent high-dose heparin administration (>300 U/kg body weight) and extracorporeal circulation for chemosaturation treatment. Due to the multiple treatments of individual patients, linear mixed-effects models were applied. Results: Thirty-one patients underwent 90 chemosaturation interventions, 68 (75.6%) of which involved heparin reversal with protamine. All investigated variables showed significant postinterventional alterations, while protamine use was associated with significantly lower aPTT, lower INR, higher PT, and higher fibrinogen levels, whereas PLT and Hb levels were comparable to those in procedures without protamine use. After adjustment for aPTT, significant independent effects of protamine remained for the INR and PT. Dose-dependent effects of protamine were observed for reductions in aPTT and an increase in fibrinogen levels, which were confirmed after adjustment for the heparin dose. A 10% higher protamine dose resulted in a 3% decrease in aPTT and a 4% increase in fibrinogen. An increase of 0.1 in the protamine-to-heparin ratio was associated with an increase of 9% in fibrinogen. Conclusions: The present results suggest that protamine contributes to the normalization of the aPTT, INR, PT, and fibrinogen levels. Further prospective studies should be conducted to determine optimal dosing ratios. ? 2025 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/clinpract15020038,Clinics and Practice
732,SC-115,Zhou et al. (2025),2025,Reconstruction of the Superior Capsule Using Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft Combined With Transposition of Biceps Tendon for Irreparable Massive Rotator Cuff Tears,"Background: Traditional superior capsular reconstruction (SCR) with biceps tendon transposition (TB) alone for irreparable massive rotator cuff tears (IMRCTs) has demonstrated a high retear rate, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Therefore, SCR using a peroneus longus tendon graft (PLG) combined with TB (PLG-TB) should be clinically studied. Purpose: To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of SCR using the PLG-TB technique versus the TB technique alone for IMRCT. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Between February 2017 and March 2022, 94 patients were diagnosed with IMRCT; 45 patients underwent SCR using the TB technique (group 1), and 49 patients underwent SCR using the PLG-TB technique (group 2). The choice of technique was based on tendon damage severity and patient preference. After a minimum follow-up period of 2 years, postoperative clinical outcomes were compared using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES); University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); Constant; and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain scores as well as the shoulder range of motion. The integrity of tendons, acromiohumeral distance, and retear was evaluated through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: The mean follow-up times were 35.2 ñ 4.2 months for group 1 and 34.1 ñ 3.2 months for group 2. There was a significant improvement observed in all clinical outcomes in both groups from the baseline preoperative evaluations to the final follow-up assessments (P =.001 for ASES score, UCLA score, Constant score, VAS score, forward flexion, abduction, and external rotation). Shoulder abduction in group 2 showed statistically significant mean improvements at the postoperative 3-month, 6-month, and final follow-ups compared with group 1 (3 months: 105.17øñ 7.13ø vs 89.34øñ 7.34ø [P =.001]; 6 months: 138.14øñ 9.12ø vs 107.35øñ 8.54ø [P =.001]; final follow-up: 157.35øñ 8.11ø vs 135.31øñ 7.01ø [P =.001]). The tendon integrity at the final follow-up (Sugaya MRI grades 1/2/3/4/5) was significantly better in group 2 (30/6/6/4/3) compared with group 1 (11/13/5/6/10) (P =.014). Additionally, the tendon retear rate was lower in group 2 (7/49; 14.29%) than in group 1 (16/45, 35.56%) (P =.015). Conclusion: Both surgical techniques led to acceptable clinical outcomes in patients with IMRCT. However, using the PLG-TB technique for SCR was associated with lower retear rates and enhanced abduction function outcomes compared with the TB technique for SCR. ? 2025 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465241303153,American Journal of Sports Medicine

734,SC-117,Jie et al. (2025),2025,Muscle mechanics and energetics in chronic ankle instability and copers during landing: Strategies for adaptive adjustments in locomotion pattern,"Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and copers typically exhibited aberrant landing kinematics. Altered kinematics might lead to changes in muscle loading, potentially affecting the energy demand of locomotion. Understanding alterations in muscle mechanics and energetics during landing could enhance the rehabilitation program design. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the muscle mechanics and energetics of individuals with CAI, copers, and healthy controls during single leg jump landing. Three groups, CAI, copers, and healthy individuals (total n = 66), performed the landing task, and data on 3D motion capture, ground reaction force (GRF), and muscle activation were simultaneously collected. A musculoskeletal model was applied to estimate muscle force and mechanical power. Compared to healthy groups, individuals with CAI showed increased peak muscle forces in the gluteus maximus (p < 0.001), gluteus medius (p < 0.001), vastus lateralis (p < 0.001), and peroneus longus (p < 0.001) during landing. Whereas copers exhibited higher peak muscle forces in the vastus lateralis (p < 0.05), medial gastrocnemius (p < 0.05), soleus (p < 0.05), and peroneus longus (p < 0.001). Additionally, negative mechanical power redistribution in CAI shifted from the ankle to the hip (p < 0.001), while copers exhibited a similar redistribution from the ankle to the knee (p < 0.05). This study suggested that both CAI and copers exhibit biomechanical modifications in proximal joints. Copers showed a novel landing strategy aimed for enhancing landing stability, but with the risk of ACL injury. The identified energy redistribution observed in both CAI and copers could potentially contribute to the recurrent ankle sprains. This research facilitates a better understanding of how muscle mechanics and energy demands influence the landing pattern in individuals with CAI and copers. ? 2025",Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2025.e41901,Heliyon
735,SC-118,Mohamed et al. (2025),2025,Functional outcomes of peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is vital for regulating posterior tibial translation in relation to the femur, which is critical for knee stability. PCL tears are infrequently isolated in knee injuries; however, the absence of the PCL results in abnormal knee kinematics, which may cause injuries to other ligaments. The ideal tendon source for PCL reconstruction is still a subject of debate. AIM To evaluate the results of employing the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) in PCL reconstruction. METHODS A comprehensive search was conducted to identify relevant randomized controlled trials and retrospective observational studies discussing the outcomes of using the PLT for PCL reconstruction. Studies published up to August 2024 were searched across multiple databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Full texts of the selected articles were retrieved, reviewed, and independently assessed by the investigators. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, with any remaining disagreements being arbitrated by a third author. RESULTS This meta-analysis included five studies on PLT use for PCL reconstruction: (1) Four prospective studies with 104 patients; and (2) One retrospective study with 18 patients. Most studies followed up participants for 24 months, while one had a shorter follow-up of 18 months. Lysholm and modified cincinnati scores improved by pooled means of 32.2 (95%CI: 29.3?35.1, I2 = 0%) and 31.1 (95%CI: 27.98?34.22, I2 = 0%), respectively. Postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores were 94.5 (I2 = 61.5%) and 94.5 (I2 = 80.09%), respectively. Single-hop and triple-hop test scores averaged 95.5 (95%CI: 94.5?96.5) and 92.4 (95%CI: 91.9?92.9) respectively. No significant differences were observed in thigh circumference at 10 cm and 20 cm between the injured and healthy sides. CONCLUSION Evidence supports PLT autografts for PCL reconstruction, improving knee function and patient outcomes. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm efficacy and compare graft options. ?

736,SC-119,Pontoh et al. (2025),2025,Anterior Knee Pain Evaluation Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Using Anterior Half of The Peroneus Longus (AHPL) Autograft,"Introduction: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is crucial for knee stability and joint movement coordination. ACL injuries are common, often leading to knee instability and subsequent complications. ACL reconstruction is a standard treatment option, with various autograft sources available. The anterior half of the peroneus longus (AHPL) tendon has emerged as a potential alternative autograft. This study aimes to examine the anterior knee pain in ACL reconstruction using AHPL. Materials and Methods: This study included 51 patients with ACL injuries undergoing ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft. Patient demographics, surgical details, and Kujala scores were collected. Results: The average age of our participants was 25.88 ñ 5.39 years, with mean BMI classified as obese. Significant improvements in Kujala and KOOS pain scores were observed between each data collection. There was a negative correlation between baseline and three and six months post-operatively Kujala and KOOS pain scores with BMI. Discussion: The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft significantly reduced anterior knee pain, as indicated by a better Kujala and KOOS pain score. Previous studies have highlighted concerns regarding anterior knee pain with other autograft sources, such as the patellar and hamstring tendons. The AHPL tendon autograft offers a promising alternative with favorable anterior knee pain and minimal donor site morbidity. Conclusion: In ACL reconstruction, the AHPL tendon autograft demonstrates excellent outcomes regarding anterior knee pain, as measured by the Kujala score. ? 2025 Pontoh et al.

737,SC-120,M‚ndez-Rebolledo et al. (2025),2025,High-Density Surface Electromyography Feedback Enhances Fibularis Longus Recruitment in Chronic Ankle Instability,"Purpose This study aimed to determine whether individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) can activate the fibularis longus compartments with high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) biofeedback to the same extent as those without CAI, and to analyze the effect of ankle position on compartment activation in individuals with CAI using HD-sEMG feedback. Methods There were 16 volunteers per group (CAI and No-CAI). The sEMG amplitude at each compartment (anterior and posterior) and the barycenter of the spatial sEMG amplitude distribution of the fibularis longus were recorded during eversion in neutral and plantar flexion positions at 30% and 70% of maximum voluntary contraction force, both with and without visual feedback on the spatial sEMG amplitude distribution. Results sEMG amplitude of the posterior compartment of the fibularis longus in the CAI group trained with HD-sEMG feedback during eversion at 70% maximum voluntary contraction (in plantar flexion) was significantly higher than without HD-sEMG feedback (95% CI = 3.75-34.50% root mean square) and was similar to the activation of the No-CAI group (95% CI = -14.34% to 34.20% root mean square). Furthermore, individuals with CAI who underwent training with HD-sEMG feedback in plantar flexion exhibited a posterior displacement of the barycenter (95% CI = 0.56-2.84 mm). Conclusions Utilizing HD-sEMG feedback during eversion in plantar flexion position increases activation of the fibularis longus posterior compartment in individuals with CAI to the same extent as healthy people. HD-sEMG-based topographic maps can serve as effective feedback training to restore motor control of the ankle. Long-term efficacy for improving motor function requires investigation through longitudinal studies. ?

738,SC-121,Helito et al. (2025),2025,"Patients submitted to re-revision ACL reconstruction present more knee laxity, more complications, and a higher failure rate than patients submitted to the first revision ACL reconstruction","Background: Few comparative studies have evaluated patients who underwent two revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and patients who underwent one revision ACLR, and many of them have a short postoperative follow-up and a relatively small number of patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the functional results, complications, and failure rates of patients who underwent one revision ACLR and patients who underwent two revision ACLRs. Methods: This is a retrospective study comparing patients who underwent one revision ACLR (Group 1) with patients who underwent a re-revision ACLR (Group 2). Baseline demographic variables, operative data and post-operative data were evaluated. Results: Among the 266 patients included, 226 were from Group 1 and 40 from Group 2. Patients in Group 2 had greater rotatory laxity and were more often subjected to associated osteotomy at the time of revision surgery. Postoperatively, patients from Group 2 reported poorer subjective IKDC score and showed greater knee laxity measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer, although both probably not clinically relevant. The complication rate was high in both groups, with a higher incidence in Group 2. Reconstruction failures were also higher in Group 2 (20% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Patients from Group 2 underwent a higher rate of associated osteotomy procedures, present higher complication rates and a higher failure rate compared with patients from Group 1. However, the functional scores (Lysholm and IKDC score) and the physical examination (KT-1000 and pivot-shift) did not show clinically relevant differences between the groups.

739,SC-122,Mishra et al. (2025),2025,Outcomes of All-Inside Arthroscopic ACL Reconstruction with Lateral Extra-Articular Tenodesis (ACLR + LET),"Background: Anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction (ACLR) produces good results when the graft and tunnel are positioned in the anatomic footprint on the femoral and tibial insertion sites in a more oblique orientation. The Anterolateral Complex of the knee and its biomechanical role in controlling rotational laxity, internal rotation, and pivot shift has led to adding adjunctive procedures like extra-articular augmentation and lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) to decrease rotational laxity. We prospectively analyzed young adults with rotational instability and generalized laxity undergoing an arthroscopic single bundle ACLR with an additional LET procedure. Methods: 42 patients, aged between 20 and 50, undergoing all-inside ACLR augmented with concomitant lateral extra-articular tenodesis between November 2020 and October 2021 were included. All patients were followed up for one year and functional assessment comprised of the International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] score, visual analogue score [VAS], and Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale at 6ÿmonths and 1ÿyear. Return to activity was assessed using the Tegner Activity Score. Results: The Lysholm score, IKDC score, and VAS showed significant improvements at 6ÿmonths after ACLR + LET (p < 0.0001) and further improved significantly at 1ÿyear. The patients had a significant decline in the Tegner Activity Scale at 6ÿmonths but returned to the near pre-injury level (5.98 ñ 0.924) at 1ÿyear (5.67 ñ 0.816) which was insignificant (p = 0.1067). Three patients sustained mild complications. 93% were satisfied with the surgery, 66% returned to sports and no patient underwent re-operation. Conclusions: Combination of LET with ACLR produces good functional outcomes, high rates of return to sports activities, and no graft failure in young patients at high risk of failure. ?

(2025),2025,Surgical Technique of Single-Graft Double-Bundle Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Peroneus Longus Tendon,"The posterior cruciate ligament is the primary posterior stabilizer of the knee. Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) has been demonstrated to improve outcomes and stability of the knee compared with conservative management. Numerous techniques are available to the treating surgeon, such as the double-bundle PCLR technique, which has biomechanical superiority over single-bundle PCLR. Residual knee laxity is decreased, native knee kinematics are better replicated, and improved subjective and objective outcomes have been reported with anatomic double-bundle PCLR. The potential disadvantages of allografts and the use of multiple grafts have created the need for the use of a double-bundle PCLR with a single autograft. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) grafts are frequently used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and good results have been reported with their use in single-bundle PCLR. The advantages of the PLT graft include a long length, large cross-sectional area, and a simple harvesting technique.

742,SC-125,Chen et al. (2025),2025,"Gait differences after ACL reconstruction versus healthy controls: a three-level meta-analysis of kinematics, kinetics, and spatiotemporal parameters","Objectives: This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate whether individuals following ACL reconstruction exhibit normalized gait biomechanics when compared to healthy controls. Methods: This review was conducted across five databases: PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science and EBSCOhost-SportDiscus, yielding a total of 5,251 records, with 21 qualified studies (52 independent samples from 861 participants; based on available data, the mean age was 26.5 ñ 4.3 years and 51.3% were female) eligible for quantitative synthesis following rigorous screening. A three-level meta-analysis model was implemented to address effect size dependencies. Six gait parameters were analyzed, including kinematic variables (peak knee flexion and extension angles during stance), kinetic variables (peak external knee flexion and extension moments during stance) and spatiotemporal variables (stride length and walking speed). Results: Among the six gait parameters that were analyzed, only the peak knee extension angle during stance (k = 9, d = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.26?1.40, I2 = 77.53%, p = 0.01) showed a significant difference between ACL reconstruction patients and healthy controls. However, peak knee flexion angle, peak external knee flexion and extension moments during stance, stride length and walking speed were not significantly different between groups (p > 0.05). Meta-regression identified a significant time-dependent improvement only for knee extension angle (F = 5.656, p = 0.049), while postoperative duration had no significant effect on other outcomes. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that the majority of gait parameters during stance, including peak knee flexion angle, external knee flexion and extension moments, stride length and walking speed, do not differ significantly between individuals with ACL reconstruction and healthy controls. Only peak knee extension angle remained impaired, though it showed signs of improvement over time. Persistent knee extension deficits emphasize the need for targeted quadriceps and knee control training as a key focus for long-term ACLR rehabilitation. ? 2025 The Author(s).

We hypothesized that SALTT with achilles allograft or semitendinosus autograft would result in similar patient outcomes and complication rates. Methods: Patients undergoing SALTT with semitendinosus autograft from 2019 to 2023 were case matched to patients with achilles allograft based on age, preoperative subjective shoulder value (SSV), and sex. Active forward elevation (aFE), external rotation (ER) lag, and SSV were assessed pre- and postoperatively. Results: Sixteen patients (17 shoulders) with semitendinosus autograft (Auto) were case matched to 17 patients with achilles allograft (Allo). SSV improved with no significant difference between groups (Auto: 71.8?ñ?7.3, Allo: 72.5?ñ?19.4, P?=?0.9). ER lag also improved, with a similar rate of a persistent ER lag (Auto: 5.9%, Allo: 11.8%, P?=?1). aFE was greater in the Allo cohort (151?ñ?16ø, 135?ñ?20ø, P?=?0.015). On linear regression analysis, a subscapularis tear requiring repair (??=??0.61, P?=?0.008) and male sex (??=??0.48, P?=?0.032) were negatively associated with final SSV. There was one surgical site infection in the Auto cohort and one traumatic graft rupture in the Allo cohort. Conclusion: SALTT with either achilles allograft or semitendinosus autograft delivers similar improvements in SSV and ER lag with minimal complication rates.

745,SC-128,Mu¤oz-Garc‚s et al. (2025),2025,Regional Activation of the Latissimus Dorsi Muscle by High-Density Surface Electromyography During Isometric Shoulder and Trunk Exercises,"Background: The latissimus dorsi (LD) comprises 2 neuromuscular regions?the thoracic and lumbar-pelvic-costal (LPC)?that may exhibit distinct activation patterns during shoulder and trunk exercises. A detailed understanding of these regional differences is crucial for optimizing therapeutic interventions due to their potential impact on muscle imbalances and rehabilitation outcomes in people with musculoskeletal conditions. Hypothesis: Increasing contraction levels are expected to amplify differences between the thoracic and LPC regions, with the thoracic region demonstrating greater activation, particularly during shoulder extension and internal rotation tasks. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Methods: A total of 20 healthy participants (15 men and 5 women) were recruited. High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) electrode grids were positioned over the LD. Participants performed isometric contractions for shoulder extension, adduction, internal rotation, and lateral trunk bending at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 100% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The variables assessed included sEMG amplitude for each region and the spatial distribution of muscle activation (x- and y-axis barycenter). Results: During shoulder extension, the thoracic region showed greater sEMG amplitudes than the LPC region at 50% (P = 0.02), 70% (P = 0.01), and 100% MVC (P < 0.01). Furthermore, shoulder extension generated greater amplitudes than all other exercises across both regions (P < 0.05). Barycenter analysis revealed a significant cephalomedial shift in the x-axis during both shoulder extension and internal rotation. Conclusion: The thoracic region is preferentially recruited during isometric shoulder extension and internal rotation. This spatial redistribution of muscle activity suggests a functional specialization within the LD, which has important implications for the development of targeted shoulder rehabilitation strategies. Clinical Relevance: Exercises emphasizing shoulder extension may preferentially activate the thoracic region of the LD, thereby enhancing scapular stability while reducing strain on the rotator cuff tendons. ? 2025 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1177/19417381251393643,Sports Health

Design: Case-control study. Settings: Sports Biomechanics Laboratory. Participants: A total of 50 male athletes (N=50) (25 CAI and 25 non-CAI) were recruited. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Ankle joint angle and torque in inversion/eversion, internal/external rotation, and dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, and EMG root mean square (RMS) values of the medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and peroneus longus. Results: Pre-fatigue, athletes with CAI showed larger maximum eversion angle and dorsiflexion torque (P<inf>FDR</inf><.05) and lower medial gastrocnemius RMS (P<inf>FDR</inf><.05), whereas fatigue caused athletes with CAI to increase maximum inversion and plantarflexion torque (P<inf>FDR</inf><.05); maximum eversion torque, tibialis anterior, and peroneus longus RMS decreased (P<inf>FDR</inf><.05). Conclusions: Pre-fatigue, athletes with CAI may adopt a compensatory protective strategy centered on an ?excessive ankle eversion-dorsiflexion.? However, fatigue disrupted this protective strategy, as reflected in a shift toward an ?inversion-plantarflexion? pattern. These findings reveal that fatigue dismantles a key protective motor strategy in athletes with CAI during a common daily task. This highlights the need for clinicians and trainers to incorporate targeted endurance training for ankle evertor and dorsiflexor muscles to prevent reinjury. ? 2025 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine",Scopus,10.1016/j.apmr.2025.10.020,Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
747,SC-130,Poffenberger et al. (2025),2025,Reconstruction of the Posterolateral Corner of the Knee,"The posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee consists of three major structures: the fibular collateral ligament (FCL); popliteus tendon (PLT); and popliteofibular ligament (PFL). The structures of the PLC play a primary role in preventing varus rotation and excessive external rotation of the knee. Injuries to the PLC commonly occur in the presence of injuries to other major structures of the knee, including the cruciate ligaments and meniscus. The presentation of PLC injuries can be overshadowed by concomitant injuries and often go underdiagnosed. PLC injuries can be reliably diagnosed with thorough physical examination and imaging, including varus stress radiographs. Nonoperative treatment has been demonstrated to be effective for grade I or grade II PLC injuries, although surgical treatment is required to restore stability to grade III PLC injured knees. Anatomic PLC reconstruction has developed into the standard of care for grade III PLC injuries and has resulted in improved objective and subjective patient outcomes. ? 2025 Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Scopus,10.1007/978-3-031-58351-3_431,0

Thirty-one statements covering five thematic topics were then derived from the responses and comprehensive literature search (Medline, Scopus and Cochrane) using variations of different search terms (literature group). The statements underwent two rating cycles by the working group, using a 5-point Likert scale in Round 2 and as a binary ?agree/disagree? in the final third round. Levels of evidence were assigned to each statement using standardized A?E and GRADE grading systems based on the available data. Results: High agreement (ò80%) was achieved for 24 of the 31 statements (range, 83%?100%), whereas for 7 agreement was <80% (range 63%?74%). The highest levels of agreement were reached for imaging modalities, treatment of PCL tibial avulsions, and preservation of native PCL fibres in reconstruction techniques, whereas the greatest divergence was observed regarding the role of leg axis and slope analyses and indications for corrective osteotomies, use of augmentation in reconstruction and post-operative rehabilitation protocols. The available level of evidence across studies in the literature was predominantly low to moderate. Of the 31 statements, 17 were graded as expert opinion (E, GRADE: very low), 12 as case series (C; GRADE: low), and only 2 achieved higher levels of evidence (B2, GRADE: moderate). Conclusion: By providing structured treatment protocols, this Delphi-based structured expert statement can support clinicians in day-to-day decision-making and ultimately improve patient care and outcomes.

(2025),2025,Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields good functional outcome of the ankle: A systematic review and meta-Analysis,"Purpose: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has emerged as a promising autograft option for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, but concerns persist regarding donor-site morbidity and ankle functional outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate ankle performance following PLT harvest for ACL reconstruction. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis performed by searching five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) up to March 2025. Inclusion criteria included: ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft, ò6-month follow-up, and validated ankle outcomes (American Orthopaedic Foot And Ankle Society [AOFAS]/Foot and Ankle Disability Index [FADI] scores). Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models using R software (version 4.4.3). Heterogeneity was assessed via Iý statistics, and risk of bias was evaluated using JBI checklists. Results: Twenty articles (1024 patients) were identified, comprising eleven prospective cohort studies and nine randomised clinical trials (RCT), based on title, abstract, and quality assessments. Meta-analysis demonstrated excellent postoperative ankle function, with pooled AOFAS scores of 96.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.6?99.3) at 6 months, 96.1 (93.9?98.2) at 12 months, and 97.2 (93.9?100.6) at 24 months. FADI scores similarly improved to 97.4 (96.0?98.9) by 6 months and 99.4 (98.7?100.1) at 24 months. Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age and AOFAS outcomes (? = ?0.23, p = 0.36). Minor complications (e.g., transient hypaesthesia) occurred in 13%?23% of patients but resolved within months. No studies reported major nerve injuries or ankle instability. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction yields minimal donor-site morbidity, with consistently high AOFAS/FADI scores across all age groups. These findings support the safety of PLT autografts, though heterogeneity is evident, and the predominance of male participants and the regional focus of studies, mainly Asian populations, may affect generalisability.

750,SC-133,Hsu et al. (2025),2025,Peroneus Longus Autograft Harvest: Patient-Reported Donor-Ankle Morbidity at 1 Year,"Background: The peroneus longus (PL) tendon is increasingly used as an autograft for ligament and tendon reconstructions, particularly in populations where hamstring graft dimensions may be insufficient. However, donor-site ankle function and patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) after PL harvest remain underreported. This study aimed to evaluate changes in PROMs and range of motion (ROM) at the donor-site ankle 1 year after PL autograft harvest and the proportion exceeding minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds. Methods: Patients who underwent PL autograft harvest from January 2021 through April 2023 were retrospectively enrolled. PROMs?including the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) score?were assessed preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up on the operated ankle. Ankle ROM was also measured. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using MCID thresholds. Results: Thirty-five patients (mean age: 43?ñ?28?years) completed follow-up at a mean of 22.5?ñ?10?months. Although ankle ROM was preserved with no statistically significant changes (P?&gt;?.05), PROMs declined significantly compared with preoperative values (P?&lt;?.05), with postoperative scores of SANE (92.3?ñ?27.3), AOFAS (96.7?ñ?10.7), FAOS (97.0?ñ?23), and CAIT (27.4?ñ?19.4). MCID thresholds were exceeded in 51.4% (SANE), 31.4% (AOFAS), 34.2% (FAOS), and 5.7% (CAIT) of patients. Two patients experienced transient sural nerve hypoesthesia, which resolved without long-term deficit. Conclusion: PL tendon harvest was associated with preserved ankle ROM at 1 year but demonstrated statistically significant declines in PROMs compared with preoperative baselines. A subset of patients exceeded MCID thresholds, indicating clinically meaningful donor-site morbidity in some cases. These findings underscore the importance of informed graft selection and highlight the need for further long-term evaluation. ?

751,SC-134,Arora et al. (2025),2025,Harvesting the Peroneus Longus Does Not Lead to Peroneal Brevis Hypertrophy: Prospective Ultrasound-Based Study of 40 Patients,"Purpose: Peroneus longus (PL) graft harvest has recently gained popularity for various ligament reconstruction surgeries. A recent systematic review shows it is a safe and reproducible technique with low morbidity of donor sites (1). The method for PL harvest routinely involves tenodesis of the PL stump to the peroneus brevis (PB); however, recent work has shown no impact on ankle functional outcomes with or without tenodesis. Harvesting of the PL should theoretically lead to a hypertrophy of the PB to compensate for its function. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of PL harvest on the PB. Methods: Institutional ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics review board (January 2024). A total of 40 consecutive patients from January 2024 to February 2024 were included in the study: 20 patients in the no tenodesis group and 20 patients in the tenodesis group. Demographic variables (age, gender, and level of play) were recorded. Pre-operative American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) and Functional Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were calculated for both groups and compared with post-operative scores at six weeks, three months, six months, and one-year follow-up. Ultrasound scan of bilateral ankle to assess PL and PB diameters was performed pre-operatively and tracked at three months, six months, and one year post-surgery. Results: For the entire study population (n = 40), we found that AOFAS and FADI scores showed no significant difference at any interval. Age, gender, and level of play had no impact on ankle functional outcomes. Harvesting the PL did not significantly increase ipsilateral PB or contralateral PL diameter post-surgery. There was no significant difference between the tenodesis and no tenodesis groups regarding either PL or PB diameter at any time. Conclusion: Tenodesis of the PL to the PB has been the standard procedure for harvesting PL grafts for various ligament surgeries. Recent work has shown that tenodesis or no tenodesis does not impact ankle functional outcomes. The present ultrasound-based study indicates that the PB does not hypertrophy to compensate for a harvested PL. Further, tenodesis or no tenodesis has no impact on either PB or PL diameters. ?

752,SC-135,Chen et al. (2025),2025,Which Graft Is Associated With Better Outcomes in ACL Reconstruction? A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Background In clinical practice, different surgical methods, including autografts, allografts, and artificial ligaments, have been used in reconstruction after ACL injuries. However, the available evidence is conflicting in terms of which approach has yielded better patient-reported outcomes, joint stability, and risk of graft reinjury. A network meta-analysis allows the comparison of approaches that have not been compared head-to-head in individual RCTs. Although several network meta-analyses have been performed on this topic, they are hampered by methodological limitations. Questions/purposes We performed an updated network meta-analysis of RCTs to answer the following questions: Considering different grafts applied in ACL reconstruction, which graft is superior in terms of (1) patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] objective score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score), (2) knee stability results (Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-1000/2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference), and (3) risk of graft reinjury? Methods We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from January 2000 to November 2024 for completed studies. We reviewed 30,976 papers, and 27 met inclusion criteria, which were as follows: RCTs published in English, RCTs that involved ACL reconstruction with different grafts (autografts, allografts, and artificial ligaments) with fully described surgical techniques, RCTs that reported on at least one of the relevant outcome measures (preoperative and postoperative IKDC objective score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, KT-1000/2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference, and risk of graft reinjury), and RCTs that reported a minimum follow-up period of 12 months with at least 80% follow-up completeness. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2.0) was used to assess the quality of the included studies, with 18 studies judged as being at a low risk of bias and 9 studies assessed as being at an unclear risk of bias. In total, 2572 patients were treated with 16 different types of grafts. The mean length of follow-up was 47 months. The mean age of the included patients was 28 years, and 71% of the patients were male. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed via the ?gemtc? and ?coda? packages of R Studio, version 4.2.1, and the ?networkplot? command of Stata 15 software was used to plot network relationships for direct and indirect comparisons between different interventions. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated to rank the intervention effects of different interventions. A SUCRA value approaching 1 (100%) indicates a greater probability that the corresponding treatment is superior in terms of efficacy or safety. The most common treatment comparisons were the single-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft versus the bone?patellar tendon?bone autograft and the single-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft versus the double-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft. Results Although there were no differences when comparing different grafts for traditional pairwise comparisons of patient-reported outcomes, joint stability, and graft reinjury, the network meta-analysis allows ranking of interventions by efficacy or safety through the SUCRA. In terms of patient-reported outcomes, the double-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft had the highest ranking for the IKDC objective score (SUCRA 77%), the single-bundle 3-strand semitendinosus tendon autograft was ranked most favorably for the Lysholm score (SUCRA 78%), and the single-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft with synthetic artificial ligament had the highest ranking for the Tegner score (SUCRA 90%). Concerning knee stability, the double-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft ranked first (SUCRA 58%) on the Lachman test, the single-bundle 5-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft ranked first (SUCRA 64%) in terms of the pivot-shift test, and the bone?patellar tendon?bone autograft was ranked most favorably for the KT-1000/2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference (SUCRA 91%). The most effective treatment in terms of graft reinjury was the double-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft (SUCRA 70%). Again, a higher SUCRA value (close to 1) represents higher probability of a treatment being ranked among the most effective interventions. Conclusion In ACL reconstruction, based on the results of SUCRA rankings, patients should be counseled that the double-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft and the bone?patellar tendon?bone autograft represent potentially superior surgical techniques for simultaneously enhancing patient comfort, restoring knee anterior stability, and having low reinjury risk, and the single-bundle 5-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft has the potential advantage in restoring rotational knee stability. To achieve best patient-reported outcomes, the single-bundle 3/4-strand semitendinosus tendon autograft and the single-bundle 4-strand semitendinosus with gracilis tendon autograft with synthetic artificial ligament are also recommended. Further comparisons of different grafts should be performed to determine whether meaningful differences exist between men and women in terms of these surgical outcomes. ? ? 2025 by the Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons.",Scopus,10.1097/CORR.0000000000003585,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research
753,SC-136,He et al. (2025),2025,Storage damage of cold-stored whole blood in CPDA maintenance fluid during the whole effective storage period,"Background: Massive hemorrhage is a leading cause of mortality among trauma patients. To date, whole blood (WB) remains the preferred resuscitation fluid on the battlefield and in pre-hospital emergency care. However, components of WB inevitably undergo storage-related damage, and differences in the duration of storage may lead to varying clinical outcomes after transfusion. This study will involve monitoring cold-stored whole blood (CS-WB) to assess variations in the concentration and activity of each component during in vitro storage. Methods: 20 bags of WB (400 mL each) from healthy donors were stored at (4 ñ 2) øC. Aliquots were collected at storage days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 for analysis. On each testing day, storage lesion related indicators of red blood cells (RBCs), plasma components, and platelets were respectively detected. Results: On the 14th day of CS-WB storage, no significant changes were found in the morphology, quantity, and function of RBCs. The oxygen carrying capacity of RBCs slightly decreased. Moreover, CS-WB was able to maintain good coagulation function, platelets morphology and hemostatic activity. On the 21st day of CS-WB storage, the oxygen carrying capacity and ATP content of RBCs showed a more significant decrease. Platelets showed characteristic ultrastructural damage and progressive decline in hemostatic function. However, thrombelastogram (TEG) results showed CS-WB could still maintain a certain level of coagulation function and thrombotic ability. By the day 28 of storage, coagulation activity decreased alongside elevated hemolysis markers, indicating progressive and remarkable storage lesion development. On the 28th day of storage, the coagulation activity significantly decreased with the increase of hemolysis markers, indicating that storage damage to active components such as RBCs, platelets, and coagulation factors in CS-WB was ongoing and remarkably developing. Conclusion: These findings show that CS-WB maintained within 14 days of storage provides optimal preservation of critical hemostatic properties, including RBCs oxygen-carrying capacity, coagulation factors function, and platelets hemostatic performance. This storage window holds particular clinical relevance for hemorrhagic shock resuscitation in resource-constrained scenarios, such as military medicine or prehospital trauma care systems. ? ? 2025 He, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Xu, Yuan, Li, Liu and Cheng.",Scopus,10.3389/fcell.2025.1610009,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology

755,SC-138,Tomaszewska et al. (2025),2025,A novel approach to monitoring rehabilitation progress in atrophic muscle using contactless measurement of free oscillations and advanced modal analysis,"This study shows a novel approach for monitoring muscle functional recovery through the analysis of its free vibrations. Contactless measurements of free-decay vibrations are carried out, and by applying an advanced experimental modal analysis, the oscillations? frequencies are identified with high accuracy. A laser displacement sensor is used to capture the oscillations at a selected muscular point. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated in the case of functional status recovery of the rectus femoris muscle, which became atrophic after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Three ACL subjects are examined, and the muscle is analyzed in two states: voluntary tension and relaxation. The analysis shows significant changes in the natural frequency of the rectus femoris throughout the muscle recovery process, with the frequency gradually approaching that of the same muscle in the subject?s contralateral (reference) leg. Moreover, the relative difference in natural frequencies identified between the ACL-affected leg and the reference leg tends, over time and within rehabilitation, to align with the values observed in healthy reference subjects. This approach demonstrates the potential to reliably measure the natural frequency of a muscle. The contactless nature of the measurement ensures that vibrations remain unaffected by any external probes. This approach shows practical potential for monitoring muscular rehabilitation progress, assessing the muscular functional status of muscles in patients with dysfunction, and evaluating muscular readiness for participation in sports competitions. ? ? 2025 Tomaszewska, Drozdowska and Aschenbrenner.",Scopus,10.3389/fbioe.2025.1496739,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology

Methods: Surgery center logs were used to identify patients who underwent ACLR with PLTA between January 2011 and January 2017 with at least 1 year of follow up. Patient demographics such as age, gender, surgical history, and presence of meniscus pathology were collected in addition to allograft data including donor age and sex. Results of both objective and subjective outcomes measures ? IKDC & modified Lysholm knee score, single leg hop test, and KT-1000 evaluation ? were compiled and evaluated at final follow up. Results: Data for 28 patients met the minimum follow up. The mean age was 35.8 years. Fourteen out of the 28 patients were female (50 %) and 13 had meniscus pathology addressed at index operation. Mean postoperative follow-up was 52 months (range 13?161). The mean age of the allograft donor was 46.4 (range 22?68). The average IKDC score was 93.05 (SD 19ñ16.25). The mean modified Lysholm score was 95.0 (SDñ9.25). Single-leg hop results averaged 94.4 % (SDñ8.2 %, range 80?110 %) of the non-operative extremity. The mean KT-1000 arthrometer measurement was 0.32 mm, 0.4 mm, and 0.6 mm for 15, 20, and 30lbs of resistance, respectively. No patient required reoperation. Conclusion: In the appropriate patient population, ACLR with PLTA can be a clinically successful operation based on patient reported outcome measures, clinical outcome measures, and graft failure rates. ? 2025 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.jorep.2025.100748,Journal of Orthopaedic Reports

While recent studies report favorable knee outcomes, concerns remain regarding donor site morbidity. The PLT plays a key role in foot biomechanics, and its harvesting may lead to subtle changes, as suggested by imaging and pedobarographic studies. Tendon regeneration may limit long-term morbidity, but further studies are needed. We recommend that future research include gait analysis, long-term follow-up, and insights from anterior cruciate ligament literature. ?The Author(s) 2025.

(2025),2025,Effects of HD-tDCS combined with Bosu ball training on static and dynamic postural stability among individuals with chronic ankle instability,"Purpose: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is characterized by a combination of peripheral dysfunction and maladaptive neuroplasticity in central nervous system, leading to persistent postural stability deficits. This study aims to investigate the effects of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) combined with Bosu ball training (BBT) on the static and dynamic postural stability in individuals with CAI. Methods: A total of forty participants were randomized to receive either HD-tDCS + BBT (n = 20) or BBT (n = 20) interventions, delivered over six weeks with three 20-minute sessions per week. Static and dynamic postural stability was assessed pre- and post-intervention via single-leg stance and drop landing tests, with kinetic data captured by a force platform (1,000?Hz). Data were analyzed using two-way mixed-design ANOVA. Results: Significant group-by-time interactions were detected in the center of pressure-root mean square (CoP_RMS) during single-leg stance (p = 0.036, ?2? = 0.134) and the time to stabilization (TTS) during drop landing (p = 0.007, ?2? = 0.209) in the mediolateral (ML) direction. Post hoc comparisons showed that the both of them were decreased after intervention, and greater decreases were observed by the intervention of HD-tDCS + BBT compared to BBT. And, a significant time main effect was observed in the CoP_RMS (p < 0.001, ?2? = 0.382) and the TTS (p = 0.005, ?2? = 0.224) in the anteroposterior direction, they both decreased after HD-tDCS + BBT and BBT interventions. Conclusions: Both BBT alone and the combined HD-tDCS + BBT interventions enhanced static and dynamic postural stability in individuals with CAI, while the combined HD-tDCS + BBT intervention demonstrated significantly greater efficacy in improving postural stability in the ML direction compared to BBT alone. 2025 Ge, Gao, Huang, Luo, Liu, Wang, Shen, Guo and Song.",Scopus,10.3389/fspor.2025.1618683,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living

Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using a ten-camera Vicon motion capture system (200 Hz) and a force plate (1000 Hz). Twenty participants with CAI ran under three different conditions: no KT (NT), short KT (ST), and long KT (LT). A five-segment foot model was used, which has 8 degrees of freedom. The results indicated that CAI individuals running with KT might decrease the subtalar eversion angle and Chopart oblique angle during the stance phase. Differences in joint moments were observed at the ankle and subtalar joints during the running stance phase, with smaller ankle plantarflexion and inversion subtalar joint moments in the LT condition compared to the NT and ST conditions. Furthermore, LT was found to decrease the ankle ligament force and increased the force of lateral gastrocnemius muscle, soleus, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis in individuals with CAI during the stance phase. These findings suggest that KT might reduce ankle ligament force and the risk of ankle sprains in individuals with CAI during running. ? 2025 International Society of Biomechanics in Sports.",Scopus,10.1080/14763141.2025.2526694,Sports Biomechanics

Methods: Patients with combined ACL and grade II MCL injuries who underwent ACL and MCL reconstruction surgery between January 2019 and December 2022 were included in this study. The instability was classified as a grade II MCL injury, based on findings from magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination. The Tegner activity scale and Lysholm score were collected preoperatively, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months postoperatively. Additionally, the number of patients with ACL reconstruction failure or residual MCL laxity at each follow-up time point was recorded. Results: A total of 197 patients underwent simultaneous reconstruction of the ACL and grade II MCL injuries. The mean age was 29 ñ 9 years, and 83% were male. Six cases of ACL reconstruction failure were observed over 60 months, with no residual MCL valgus laxity at the final follow-up. Significant improvements in both the Tegner activity scale and Lysholm knee scoring scale were noted at all follow-up points compared to preoperative scores (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The floating meniscus sign proved to be a valuable finding in guiding the surgical management of combined ACL and grade II MCL injuries. Our results suggest that, in physically active patients presenting with this sign, performing both ACL and MCL reconstruction leads to excellent mid-term outcomes, with significant functional improvement and a low rate of graft failure or residual valgus instability. This supports the surgical indication of MCL reconstruction in selected grade II injuries when the floating meniscus sign is present, potentially preventing long-term instability and suboptimal recovery.

761,SC-144,Kim et al. (2025),2025,Corticospinal and Spinal-reflex Excitability during Unipedal Stance following Acute Lateral Ankle Sprain,"Background Acute lateral ankle sprains (ALAS) are linked to altered spinal-reflexive excitability that may predicate sensorimotor dysfunction. However, sensorimotor control is influenced by spinal and supraspinal mechanisms, necessitating examination of each following ALAS. We aimed to investigate the effects of ALAS on neural excitability during unipedal stance, relating these neural adaptations to clinical outcomes. Methods 26 young adults were enrolled (13 ALAS: 19.6 ñ 1.9 years; 13 uninjured controls: 20.7 ñ 2.4 years). Spinal-reflex excitability was assessed at the soleus using the Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex), evoking maximal reflexive (Hmax) and motor (Mmax) responses from electrical stimulation. Corticospinal excitability was assessed via motor evoked potentials (MEP) from transcranial magnetic stimulation, recording responses at 100%, 120%, and 140% of active motor threshold, and normalized to background EMG prior to stimuli and Mmax. For clinical outcomes, area and velocity of unipedal center-of-pressure measurements were recorded, along with acute symptoms (pain and swelling) and ankle disability. Results Independent t-tests revealed no significant differences in spinal-reflex excitability between ALAS and uninjured control (CON) groups. However, corticospinal excitability was significantly higher in patients with ALAS across all stimulus intensities (MEP100%: ALAS = 2.7 ñ 1.2, CON = 1.2 ñ 0.6, p < 0.001; MEP120%: ALAS = 3.9 ñ 1.1, CON = 2.6 ñ 1.8, p = 0.033; MEP140%: ALAS = 3.9 ñ 1.9, CON = 2.4 ñ 1.6, p = 0.031). Patients with ALAS exhibited impaired postural control, as shown by larger area (ALAS = 2.9 ñ 0.7, CON = 2.2 ñ 0.6, p = 0.049) and higher velocity (ALAS = 3.3 ñ 1.0, CON = 2.7 ñ 0.5, p = 0.005). Pearson's product-moment correlations found that increased corticospinal excitability did not significantly correlate with impaired postural control or acute symptoms; however, higher corticospinal excitability was associated with more severe ankle disability (r = -0.607 to -0.721, p = 0.028 to 0.005). Conclusions This study provides initial evidence that ALAS affects neural excitability during unipedal stance predominantly at the corticospinal level, which may contribute to ankle disability. ? 2025 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1249/MSS.0000000000003798,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise

The mean Lysholm score on 27 (38.6%) patients was 87.2 ñ 7.3, while IKDC2000 was reported only in one study was 62. Regarding return to sport, five articles reported a full return to sports activity after 6?9 months, while when return to sports was evaluated by Tegner reporting a mean value of 7.8 ñ 2.4 (range: 3?10). Conclusion: Notwithstanding conflicting data, most patients who have undergone distal MCL lesion surgical treatment, either in isolation or associated with knee ligamentous injuries, achieve satisfactory clinical and functional outcomes, a low rate of postoperative complications, and a high rate of return to recreational sports.

Methods: 12 male runners of 200, 400 m were subjected to four WAnT of different durations and loads. The changes of AC and lower limb muscle characteristics were analyzed by WAnT and electromyography. Results: The result shows that the integrated of electromyography (lEMG), root mean square% (RMS%), mean power frequency (MPF) and AC of lower limb muscles of rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA) and peroneus longus (PL) were increased by duration (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference in lEMG of MG (P > 0.05). Load significantly increased AC, IEMG, RMS% and MPF of lower limb muscles (P < 0.01). The interaction effect of duration and load had no significant difference on PP, MP, IEMG, RMS% and MPF (P > 0.05), but increased on Fl (P < 0.05). Discussion: In conclusion, for 200 m and 400 m athletes, it is recommended to use a combination of 20 s and 10.5%BM load to achieve optimal peak power, as well as a combination of 20 s and 9.5%BM load for better average power. Different combinations of duration and load can be selected during the test to assess the corresponding capability. ? ? 2025 Liu, Yan, Gong and Liu.",Scopus,10.3389/fphys.2025.1582875,Frontiers in Physiology
764,SC-147,Ziani et al. (2025),2025,Complex Post-Traumatic Reconstruction of the Lower Limb: A Case Report on Managing Soft Tissue Defects and Deltoid Ligament Damage Using an ALT Flap With Fascia Lata Extension and Fascia Lata Graft,"AIM: High-energy ankle traumas often lead to extensive soft tissue loss and ligament damage, making reconstruction both challenging and crucial for restoring stability and function. This study evaluated the effectiveness of using a free anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap with a fascia lata extension for addressing complex soft tissue defects and repairing the deltoid ligament in complex post-traumatic ankle injuries. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old man was examined at the Plastic Surgery Unit three months after a motorcycle crash for reconstruction of a soft tissue defect and deltoid ligament repair. Clinical examination revealed a 3 ? 5 cm soft tissue defect with bone exposure and ankle instability. Reconstruction was planned and performed using a free ALT flap with an extension of the fascia lata and a fascia lata graft for deltoid ligament repair. No complications of the flap and no clinical signs of local infection were observed. During the follow-up period of 12 months, the ankle stability and the gait were improved with a reduction in pain. RESULTS: No complications related to the flap or clinical signs of infection were observed postoperatively. During the 12-month follow-up period, the patient exhibited improved ankle stability, reduced pain, and enhanced gait. At the one-year follow-up, the patient achieved a satisfactory functional outcome with an American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of 79 points. The reconstructed tissue demonstrated adequate coverage, and the deltoid ligament repair provided joint stability. While flap bulkiness necessitated minor debulking surgery, the aesthetic and functional outcomes were satisfactory, with the patient expressing high satisfaction at 15 months post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The ALT flap combined with fascia lata graft is a viable option for soft tissue loss and deltoid ligament injury in clinical cases. While the ALT flap offers numerous advantages, including ease of harvest, pedicle length, and versatility, its bulkiness may necessitate revision surgery. However, despite this drawback, the combination of ALT flap and fascia lata demonstrated positive outcomes in our patient, highlighting its effectiveness in providing adequate tissue coverage and repairing the deltoid ligament. ? 2025 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.62713/aic.3691,Annali Italiani di Chirurgia

Crowdsourcing platforms are promising instruments for achieving this purpose. Aware of this potential, local governments across the world have used these platforms to connect with citizens, adopting various approaches and getting different outcomes. However, it is not clear how crowdsourcing platforms facilitate openness or which types of platforms are more suitable for problem-solving, innovation, or collaboration. In this chapter, we describe the main design choices in a crowdsourcing platform that could help get the best out of the crowds.

766,SC-149,Bilgasem et al. (2025),2025,"Large variability in minimal clinically important difference, substantial clinical benefit and patient acceptable symptom state values among literature investigating patellar stabilization surgery: A systematic review","Purpose: To investigate minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) values for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) after patellar stabilization surgery for patellar instability. Secondary outcomes included to describe methods to calculate clinically significant outcomes (CSOs), and to report on the achievement of these metrics. Methods: On 31 July 2024, three databases were searched. Information on whether studies calculated MCID, SCB or PASS values or used previously established values was recorded. Data on study characteristics, CSO values, and the method of MCID quantification (e.g., distribution vs. anchor) were extracted. Results: A total of 17 articles with 1447 patients (1462 knees) were included. A total of 18 unique outcome measures were reported. Six out of 15 (40%), 2 out of 5 (40%), and zero studies used prior established values for MCID, SCB and PASS, respectively. MCID ranged widely (e.g., International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC]: 5.6?20.5; Kujala Anterior Knee Pain Scale: 5.38?11.9 and Lysholm: 5.6?11.1). Fourteen out of 15 utilized a distribution-based method to calculate MCID, with only one study using an anchor-based method. SCB values ranged widely as well (e.g., IKDC: 14.5?23.6; Knee Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score [KOOS] symptoms: 4.2?14.2 and KOOS activities of daily living [ADLs]: 6.5?25.7). Large variability was found among percentages of patients that achieved MCID values (e.g., IKDC: 28%?98.6%, Kujala: 38%?100%, Lysholm: 44%?98.4% and Tegner: 84%?95%). Conclusion: The significant heterogeneity in reported thresholds for MCID, SCB and PASS across studies highlights critical challenges in interpreting results after patellar stabilization surgery, specifically regarding what constitutes a clinically relevant outcome. MCID was the most commonly reported metric and calculated predominantly with distribution-based methods, with over half of the studies using previously established thresholds. PASS and SCB were widely underreported as well, suggesting a need for studies investigating patellar stabilization to prioritize the calculation of all three metrics, using anchor-based techniques.

This study evaluated the risk perception of residents facing the risk of rupture of this mining tailings dam, in addition to evaluating its influence on the lives of residents. Interviews were conducted with residents of the municipality (n = 62) between May and June 2021. Of those interviewed, 38.7% were removed from their homes. Only 56.5% had heard about the risk of collapse in 2019. The most used risk monitoring information sources were social media (45.2%) and the internet (37.1%). Upon receiving the news, most reported reactions of suffering and negative feelings such as fear, revolt and despair; 88.7% reported the emergence of economic (54.8%), environmental (41.9%), social (32.2%) and health (74.2%) problems, of which anxiety and depression were more frequently cited. Alcoholism, psychological disorders, ulcers, insomnia, cardiac arrhythmia and stress were also mentioned. The majority (58.1%) confirmed the worsening of health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over two years after the announcement of the risk, the belief in the rupture decreased among interviewees. This study demonstrated that failures in risk communication, combined with the invisibility of psychological and social effects, exacerbated the vulnerability of the population to the risks associated with the ?invisible mud.?

(2025),2025,Association between foot morphology and dynamic knee valgus during single leg squats in recreational male football players: a cross-sectional study,"Purpose. This study examines the relationship between foot morphology, foot type, and dynamic knee valgus in male football players during single-leg squats using biomechanical analyses. Methods. A cross-sectional study design was adopted. Male football players (n = 151) aged between 18 and 30 years belonging to three Malaysian football clubs were recruited. Of these participants, foot type, single-leg squat (SLS) performance, knee alignment using knee frontal plane projection angle (FPPA), and other measures of foot morphology were recorded, including foot length, foot width, truncated foot length, and navicular height. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between foot type, SLS, and knee alignment. Bipoint serial correlations were used to determine the relationship between foot morphology, SLS, and knee alignment. Results. A significant association was found between foot type and SLS (p < 0.05). During the SLSs, only navicular height (r<inf>pb</inf> = 0.154, n = 151, p < 0.05) and dorsal height (r<inf>pb</inf> = 0.144, n = 151, p < 0.05) showed a statistically significant connection in the dominant leg. In contrast, only navicular height in the non-dominant leg (r<inf>pb</inf> = 0.169, n = 151, p < 0.05) showed a significant correlation with SLSs. Conclusions. This study established a strong link between foot type and SLS in football players. Specifically, a statistically significant association between navicular and dorsal height in the dominant leg and navicular height in the non-dominant leg. This study emphasises the significance of foot morphology and the dynamic evaluation of knee valgus during functional movements. ?

770,SC-153,Newton et al. (2025),2025,Endoscopic Flexor Hallucis Longus Transfer With Interference Screw and Additional Tension Slide Cortical Button for Chronic Achilles Tendon Rupture,"Background: Endoscopic flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon transfer can be used in the management of acute or chronic Achilles tendon rupture (ATR), including in elite sportspeople. A recent cadaveric study demonstrated that an increased ultimate load could be applied using an FHL tendon transfer with interference screw and cortical button applied using a tension slide technique compared with interference screw alone. The aim of this study was to explore patient-reported functional outcomes following this modification to this operation. Methods: We reviewed the imaging, history, patient-related outcome measures (PROMs), and complications of 17 patients who underwent endoscopic FHL tendon transfer for chronic ATR using the modified FHL reconstruction technique. The primary outcome was the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOxFQ), EuroQol?5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), and visual analog score for pain (VAS-Pain) with a mean follow up of 1.5 years. Results: Seventeen patients (11 male, 6 female) underwent endoscopic FHL tendon transfer for chronic ATR between September 2020 and May 2023. Mean (SD) age at the time of surgery was 58.3 (16.1) years, and mean (SD) BMI was 27.6 (4.8). A specific event in the history associated with the rupture was present in 13 of 17 patients (76.5%); the median (IQR) time between injury and surgery was 33 weeks (21-42). Sixteen surgeries were primary procedures for chronic ATR, and 1 surgery was a revision procedure after a failed open acute ATR repair. MOxFQ, EQ-5D, and VAS-pain scores all showed a statistically significant improvement postoperatively (minimum 10 months) when compared to preoperative scores. There was 1 symptomatic complication of tibial neuritis (5.9%). Conclusion: Endoscopic FHL tendon transfer for chronic ATR augmented using a cortical button as well as an interference screw seems to be a safe and effective procedure, with patients reporting a statistically significant improvement in health-related quality of life, pain, and specific foot and ankle outcome function.

Two approaches, such as term dependency in texts and automated essay scoring using a machine learning technique (BERT), were employed to predict writing performance and CTD factor scores. The results, which are based on the term dependency reflect the levels of essay scores and factor scores, and illustrate the relationships between dependency and ability level using corresponding analysis of these frequencies. A machine learning based approach can predict accurately essay and comment scores from these texts, however, the prediction for CTD factor scores needs further improvements. ?

772,SC-155,Zhao et al. (2025),2025,The Effect of Chronic Ankle Instability on Lower Limb Biomechanics During Medial Landings in Badminton Players,"Background: Ankle sprains are very common in badminton, and chronic ankle instability (CAI) often develops in players after these injuries. CAI badminton players (CAIBP) are more susceptible to injuries during high-intensity tasks, such as jumping landings, due to decreased ankle stability. This study aims to ex-plore the variations in lower limb biomechanics between CAIBP and normal badminton players (NBP) during single-leg medial landing tasks. Methods: Sixteen CAIBP and sixteen NBP university badminton players volunteered to participate in this experiment. The study used OpenSim open-source software to simulate and calculate lower limb joint angles, moments, and joint stiffness for the CAI group and healthy controls during a single-leg medial landing task, and utilized Delsys EMG to assess muscle pre-activation and activation levels. Independent samples t-tests and one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping were used to analyze the ex-perimental results. Results: In terms of kinematics, before and after initial contact (IC) during landing, CAIBP showed significantly greater hip adduction and flexion angles than NBP (p < 0.001). Pre-IC, CAIBP exhibited less knee flexion (p = 0.004). Both pre-and post-IC, CAIBP exhibited significantly greater dorsiflexion angles (p = 0.045) and inversion angles (p < 0.001). In terms of muscle activation and dynamics, pre-IC, CAIBP had significantly less pre-activation of the peroneus longus than NBP (p = 0.007), and significantly more gastroc-nemius lateral (p = 0.021) and gastrocnemius medial (p < 0.001) pre-activation. Post-IC, CAIBP had significantly greater muscle activation of the tibialis anterior (p < 0.001). Post-IC, peak knee extension moments (p = 0.012) and peak ankle plantarflexion moments (p = 0.001) were significantly greater in CAIBP than in NBP. In addition, CAIBP reported significantly higher knee stiffness (p = 0.001) and ankle stiffness (p < 0.001). Conclusions: During the medial landing task, CAIBP exhibited increased hip adduction and flexion, altered sagittal plane motion of the ankle, and increased activation of certain lower extremity muscles compared to NBP. Al-though these altered landing mechanisms contribute to enhanced stability during landing to some extent, they may also increase the potential risk of knee injury. ? 2025 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.14326/abe.14.134,Advanced Biomedical Engineering

This study evaluated participants using tensiomyography and isokinetic trunk strength tests. An independent t-test compared the control group and the NSCLBP group, while a two-way mixed ANOVA analyzed differences in the erector spinae?s acute muscle fatigue response before and after exercise within and between groups. The results of the tensiomyography indicated that the NSCLBP group exhibited significantly lower Dm and Vc (p < 0.05) compared to the control group, while Tc showed no significant difference between groups. Significant differences in all variables were observed between the groups in the isokinetic trunk strength test (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the two-way mixed ANOVA revealed significant group main effects in Dm and Vc of the erector spinae (p < 0.05). This study found that non-specific chronic low back pain is linked to a decrease in Dm, Vc, and trunk isokinetic strength in both extensor and flexor muscles. It suggests that future research should further investigate the acute muscle fatigue response in individuals with and without NSCLBP. ? 2024 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/bioengineering11121202,Bioengineering

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze 96 patients who underwent single-bundle reconstruction of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in our hospital from January 2020 to June 2023. The patients were divided into three groups according to the position of the endobutton on the lateral knee radiography. The first group is the position of endobutton in front of the lateral cortex of the femur, the second group is the position of endobutton in back of the lateral cortex of the femur, and the third group is the position of endobutton behind the femur. Knee Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Evaluation, Tegner Activity Scale, knee flexion angle and postoperative complication rate of the three groups were compared to evaluate whether there were statistical differences among the three groups. Results: There were 39 patients in group 1, 46 patients in group 2, and 11 patients in group 3. The mean Lysholm Knee Scores of the group 1 was 91.77, 92.17 in group 2, and 90.36 in group 3. The mean IKDC Evaluation of group 1 was 90.48, 92.41 in group 2, and 93.00 in group 3. Tegner Activity Level was 5.69 in group 1, 5.72 in group 2, and 5.45 in group 3. The mean flexion degree was found as 125ø in patients in group1, 127ø in group 2, and 122ø in group 3. There was no statistically significant difference between Lysholm Knee Scores (p = 0.434), IKDC (p = 0.068), Tegner Activity Level (p = 0.797), and knee flexion angle (p = 0.135). There was also no significant difference in the incidence of complications among the three groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: There were not statistically differences in clinical functional results when comparing patients? endobutton location on femur.

(2024),2024,Novel modified implant fixation technique for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring and peroneus longus autografts in limited resource settings: a comparative study on knee stability,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing popularity of contact sports, the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries is rising. ACL reconstruction has been recognized as the most common procedure to restore knee stability. One of the main drawbacks of standard implant is that the medical costs incurred are often beyond the reach of most patients, so patients who need ACL reconstruction surgery must find other financially affordable alternatives. Due to the many knee joint complications involving patellar and hamstring tendon grafts in ACL reconstruction, the new proposed solution is anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This research was an analytical study with a cross-sectional observational design. The sample in this study compared patients diagnosed with ACL rupture who received ACL reconstruction treatment using a modified implant with a hamstring tendon autograft and a peroneus longus tendon autograft. The sample was examined using the consecutive sampling technique by tracing medical record data, used as secondary data, and through the distribution of the Lysholm Knee and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring questionnaires. RESULTS: Out of 69 samples that met the inclusion criteria, 45 were hamstring autograft samples, and 24 were peroneus autograft samples. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of Lysholm Knee Score (P=0.135), International Knee Documentation Committee Score (P=0.352), use of a mobile aider (P=0.488), power grading (P=0.905), and range of motion of the knee (P=0.110). CONCLUSIONS: The hamstring autograft and peroneus autograft groups did not show a significant difference in clinical functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction with the modified implant technique. ? 2024 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.",Scopus,10.23736/S0394-9508.24.05789-9,Chirurgia (Turin)
776,SC-159,Xu et al. (2024),2024,CCL4L2 participates in tendinopathy progression by promoting macrophage inflammatory responses: a single-cell analysis,"Background: Tendinopathy is very common in clinical practice, which is highly prevalent in athletes, sports enthusiasts and other people involved in high-load weight-bearing activities. Common types of tendinopathy include rotator cuff injury, Achilles tendinitis, tennis elbow and so on. Macrophages (Macs) are key immune cells in the pathogenesis of tendinopathy. In this study, CCL4L2+ M1-related signaling pathways were screened by combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to explore their significance in tendinopathy treatment. Methods: Immune cell populations were screened by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) downscaling, and Mac cell subsets were annotated using cell marker genes. The cellular communication mechanism between different cellular subsets such as Macs and tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) was demonstrated by cellular communication analysis. Based on cell marker genes of CCL4L2 + M1, Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were performed to compare the expression differences in M1 and M2 between the Disease and Healthy groups. Associations between CCL4L2+ M1 and TSPCs were inferred by cell-cell communication analysis. The effects of CCL4L2 on Mac polarization and TSPCs were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: The proportions of TSPCs, endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and immune cells were significantly elevated in the Disease group. The proportion of M1 cells in the Disease group was higher than that in the Healthy group, while the proportion of M2 cells was lower than that in the Healthy group. M1 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched to disease-related and immunoinflammation-related signaling pathways. Signaling intensities between M1 and TSPCs in pathways related to immunoinflammation and ischemic injury were significantly increased in the Disease group. The proportion of CCL4L2 + M1 in the Disease group was significantly higher than in the Healthy group, and communications between CCL4L2 + M1 and TSPCs varied significantly. Compared with the Control group, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were higher in the CCL4L2 group, and the expression levels of tendon differentiation markers (Egr1, Mkx, Scx, Type 1 collagen, Tnmd) were significantly down-regulated. Conclusion: The present study analyzed the heterogeneous alterations in the Healthy and Disease groups by scRNA-seq data and found that there was a significant inflammatory infiltrate in the Disease group with markedly increased Mac activity, which was associated with activation of the CCL4L2 + M1-associated signaling pathways. CCL4L2 promotes M1 polarization and inhibits TSPC differentiation through activating M1-related inflammatory signaling pathways. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of tendon injury progression and provide potential targets for tendinopathy treatment. ?

777,SC-160,Chia et al. (2024),2024,The clinical effects of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy for the management of chronic ankle instability: a study protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial,"Background: Chronic ankle instability is associated with long-term neuromuscular deficits involving poor postural control and peroneal muscular impairment. Symptoms of chronic ankle instability hinder engagement in physical activity and undermine the patient?s quality of life. Despite the existence of various treatment modalities, none has conclusively provided evidence of clinical effectiveness in counteracting neuromuscular deficits, such as arthrogenic muscle inhibition of the peroneal longus (PL). Pulse electromagnetic field therapy employed as an adjunct biophysical therapy can potentially improve stability by mitigating peroneal muscle weakness and by activating the peroneal muscle. We postulate that by combining standard care (muscle strengthening, balance training, and range of motion exercise) with pulse electromagnetic field therapy, postural control stability and peroneal muscle weakness will significantly improve. Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 48 adults with chronic ankle instability will be recruited and randomly allocated into either the intervention or control groups. The intervention group (n = 24) will receive active pulse electromagnetic field therapy and standard exercise training, while the control group (n = 24) will receive sham pulse electromagnetic field therapy and standard exercise training for 8ÿweeks. Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, week 4, 8 as well as at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits. Discussion: Chronic ankle instability is a common debilitating condition without a curative conservative treatment. Investigating different treatment modalities will be essential for improving rehabilitation outcomes in this clinical population. This study will investigate the effectiveness of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy on the functional and clinical outcomes in the chronic ankle instability population.

CAIT scores, muscle strength (isokinetic) and proprioception in plantarflexion (PF), dorsiflexion (DF), inversion (IV), and eversion (EV), and dynamic balance (Star Excursion Balance Test in anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral directions) were assessed. Bivariate correlations were used to determine the relationship between CAIT scores and ankle muscle strength, proprioception, and dynamic balance. Results: In terms of muscle strength, ankle PF (r = 0.378, 95%CI: 0.046?0.635, P = 0.027) and IV (r = 0.527, 95%CI: 0.233?0.736, P = 0.001) strength were positively correlated with CAIT Score, whereas ankle DF and EV strength had no significant correlation with CAIT Score. In terms of proprioception, ankle IV proprioception (r = -0.340, 95%CI: -0.608?0.002, P = 0.027) was negatively correlated with CAIT Score, while ankle PF, DF, and EV proprioception had no significant correlation with CAIT Score. In terms of dynamic balance, the SEBT posteromedial (r = 0.444, 95%CI: 0.124?0.680, P = 0.001) was positively correlated with CAIT Score. The SEBT anterior and posterolateral were not significantly correlated with the CAIT Score. Conclusion: This study found that increasing ankle plantarflexion and inversion muscle strength, improving dynamic balance in the posteromedial direction, and decreasing ankle inversion proprioceptive thresholds may help improve the subjective stability of CAI. This provides data support for targeted ankle neuromuscular function rehabilitation training for patients. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2100044089.

779,SC-162,Promsri et al. (2024),2024,A Potential Mechanism Involved in the Regularity of Center-of-Pressure Displacements During Achieving Unipedal Equilibrium on Stable and Unstable Surfaces,"Sample entropy (SampEn) is a widely used measure for estimating the regularity of center-of-pressure (COP) trajectories, with high COP regularity (low SampEn) commonly interpreted as ineffective postural control. The current study aimed to investigate one possible source of COP regularity?agonist?antagonist coactivation?resulting in joint stiffness or action stability. A cross-correlation analysis was conducted to determine the similarity (coactivation) level of 5 pairs of lower limb agonist?antagonist electromyographic signals. SampEn was applied to anteroposterior (ap) and mediolateral (ml) COP displacements. Electromyographic and COP signals were simultaneously derived from 25 active young adults (25.6 ñ 4.0 years) during unipedal balancing on stable and multiaxial-unstable surfaces. Then, the correlation between individual agonist?antagonist cross-correlation coefficients and SampEn-COP was explored. The results show that only the tibialis anterior?peroneus longus (TA?PL) coactivations are negatively correlated with SampEn-COP<inf>ap/ml</inf> (P ó .030) in both surface conditions, with greater TA?PL coactivation appearing with lower SampEn-COP<inf>ap/ml</inf>. In addition, sex effects as one factor that might influence postural control were also tested. Women exhibited greater TA?PL coactivation (P = .017) and lower SampEn-COP<inf>ap</inf> (P = .005) than men. Together, TA?PL coactivation could be one possible origin of COP regularity, but its effects might be detrimental to unipedal postural control, especially for women. ? 2024 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jab.2022-0129,Journal of Applied Biomechanics

A case of leg compartment syndrome following peroneus longus tendon harvest for a revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is described. Symptoms began on the first day after surgery, including intense pain in the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot and motor and sensory deficits of the common peroneal nerve. Emergency decompressive fasciotomy was necessary. The patient presented a complete resolution of symptoms and neurological deficit 24 days after surgery.

(2024),2024,The potential of tendon autograft as meniscus substitution: Current concepts,"Meniscectomy is known to alter the mechanics, stability, and kinematics of the tibiofemoral joint, leading to early knee osteoarthritis (KOA). While several meniscal substitutions exist, such as meniscus allograft transplantation, collagen meniscus implants, and artificial substitutes, they often come with technical challenges, high costs, and risks, including allograft failure, infections, and disease transmission. Tendon autografts emerge as a promising option, offering safety, availability, biocompatibility, and a reduced risk of pathophoresis. This review delves into basic, in vivo, in vitro, and biomechanical studies alongside clinical outcomes and future prospects of tendon autografts as meniscus substitutes. A thorough understanding of this option is vital for integrating these evolving techniques into clinical practice and mitigating early KOA progression. ? 2024 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.jisako.2024.100353,Journal of ISAKOS
782,SC-165,de Oliveira et al. (2024),2024,Evaluation of the peroneus longus tendon as an autologous graft in knee surgery,"Our hypothesis is that the peroneus longus (PL) is a great option for ligament reconstruction in the knee, and therefore the objective of the study is to determine if the use of this graft is safe and does not cause secondary damage to the harvested area. A prospective study was conducted between April 2019 and September 2022. Patients who underwent any type of knee ligament reconstruction using the PL or just the anterior half (AHPL) as grafts were followed up. These patients were evaluated according to the Tegner?Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) guidelines for functional evaluation of the knee and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) for the functional evaluation of the ankle. Most patients had an increase in the IKDC score, Tegner?Lysholm score, AOFAS and FADI regardless of the graft used in the surgical procedure, with mean values at the 24-month follow-up of, respectively, 99.02ñ 0.02, 98.69ñ 0.08, 99.92ñ 0.07, and 99.92ñ 0.07 for those with PL grafts and 99.31ñ 0.54, 98.88ñ 0.95, 100ñ 0.00, and 100ñ 0.00 for those with AHPL grafts. The differences in the scores between the two graft groups during each of the follow-up periods were significant (P = 0.001). The use of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft in knee surgeries was shown to be adequate for achieving good knee functional results. ?

783,SC-166,Ao et al. (2024),2024,Comparison of synergy extrapolation and static optimization for estimating multiple unmeasured muscle activations during walking,"Background: Calibrated electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal models can provide insight into internal quantities (e.g., muscle forces) that are difficult or impossible to measure experimentally. However, the need for EMG data from all involved muscles presents a significant barrier to the widespread application of EMG-driven modeling methods. Synergy extrapolation (SynX) is a computational method that can estimate a single missing EMG signal with reasonable accuracy during the EMG-driven model calibration process, yet its performance in estimating a larger number of missing EMG signals remains unknown. Methods: This study assessed the accuracy with which SynX can use eight measured EMG signals to estimate muscle activations and forces associated with eight missing EMG signals in the same leg during walking while simultaneously performing EMG-driven model calibration. Experimental gait data collected from two individuals post-stroke, including 16 channels of EMG data per leg, were used to calibrate an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model, providing ?gold standard? muscle activations and forces for evaluation purposes. SynX was then used to predict the muscle activations and forces associated with the eight missing EMG signals while simultaneously calibrating EMG-driven model parameter values. Due to its widespread use, static optimization (SO) applied to a scaled generic musculoskeletal model was also utilized to estimate the same muscle activations and forces. Estimation accuracy for SynX and SO was evaluated using root mean square errors (RMSE) to quantify amplitude errors and correlation coefficient r values to quantify shape similarity, each calculated with respect to ?gold standard? muscle activations and forces. Results: On average, compared to SO, SynX with simultaneous model calibration produced significantly more accurate amplitude and shape estimates for unmeasured muscle activations (RMSE 0.08 vs. 0.15, r value 0.55 vs. 0.12) and forces (RMSE 101.3 N vs. 174.4 N, r value 0.53 vs. 0.07). SynX yielded calibrated Hill-type muscle?tendon model parameter values for all muscles and activation dynamics model parameter values for measured muscles that were similar to ?gold standard? calibrated model parameter values. Conclusions: These findings suggest that SynX could make it possible to calibrate EMG-driven musculoskeletal models for all important lower-extremity muscles with as few as eight carefully chosen EMG signals and eventually contribute to the design of personalized rehabilitation and surgical interventions for mobility impairments. ?

784,SC-167,Futatsubashi et al. (2024),2024,Neurophysiologic inhibitory factors influencing subsequent ankle sprain in collegiate male athletes: a prospective cohort study,"Many athletes with recurrent ankle sprains complain of neurophysiological deficits related to chronic ankle instability (CAI). However, it remains unclear how changes in the corticospinal pathway affect the potential risk of subsequent ankle sprains. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the corticospinal excitability (input?output properties) and silent period (SP) could be related to the risk of subsequent ankle sprains among athletes. Forty-three male collegiate basketball athletes were enrolled, and 82 ankles were finally sorted into four ankle groups based on symptoms (CAI, sub-CAI, copers, and normal). The neurophysiological data was recorded in both ankles using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as baseline assessments. Subsequently, we prospectively followed the occurrence of subsequent ankle sprain injuries for 24 months (SG, subsequent ankle sprain group; NSG, non-sprain group). In the baseline assessment, we confirmed that the threshold of the input?output properties in the CAI group was higher than those in the normal group. After the follow-up, 22 ankles sustained subsequent ankle sprains (SGs). We also found that SGs exhibited a significantly longer SP at the middle and high stimulus intensities of TMS compared to NSGs (60 ankles) (middle: p = 0.012, Cohen?s d = 0.644, and high: p = 0.020, Cohen?s d = 0.590). These findings suggest that a prolonged SP could be a crucial factor affecting subsequent ankle sprains in athletes. To prevent further recurrent sports injuries, neurophysiologic probes, particularly a longer SP, might be a potential assessment tool to return to the field. ?

785,SC-168,Tate et al. (2024),2024,Patient characteristics influencing knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome scores vary with time from patellar dislocation and number of dislocations,"Objectives: Demographic characteristics of the patient population influence patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) following patellar dislocations. The time from injury and number of dislocations can also vary within the patient population. The hypothesis of the study is that characteristics of the patient population influencing Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) measures of pain, function, and quality of life vary with time from patellar dislocation and number of dislocations. Methods: Outcome scores were evaluated for subjects in four groups: within five months of a first patellar dislocation (first-time group, n ?= ?24), within five months of a recurrent dislocation (multiple group, n ?= ?15), five to twelve months after a first dislocation (post-acute group, n ?= ?14), and two years or longer after a first dislocation (two-year group, n ?= ?14). For each group, KOOS pain, physical function, and quality of life scores were compared between males and females. KOOS scores were also correlated against age, body mass index (BMI), and time since first and most recent dislocation. Results: For the first-time dislocation group, physical function, and quality of life scores were higher for men than women (p ?< ?0.05). For the multiple dislocation group, pain and physical function improved as BMI decreased (p ?< ?0.025), while quality of life improved as age decreased (p ?= ?0.014). For the post-acute group, all three scores improved as BMI decreased (p ?< ?0.05). For the two-year group, all three scores worsened as time since first dislocation increased (p ?< ?0.01). Conclusions: Following patellar dislocation, relationships between characteristics of the patient population and PROMs vary with time from injury and number of dislocations. In the acute phase following a first dislocation, PROMs likely reflect the traumatic injury. Based on relationships with BMI, outcomes likely reflect functional capacity of the knee in the acute phase of multiple dislocations and post-acute phase of a first dislocation. After multiple years, progressive degradation of the knee over time seems to influence PROMs. Level of evidence: Retrospective study with more than one negative criterion (Level 4). ? 2024 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.jisako.2024.100335,Journal of ISAKOS
786,SC-169,Hajilou et al. (2024),2024,Effect of foot type on electromyography characteristics and synergy of lower limb muscles during running,"The foot structure is associated with different running mechanics. The central nervous system is responsible for using the muscles through synergies during locomotion. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of foot structure on the electromyography factors and the synergy of the selected muscles of the lower extremity. Tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus longus, soleus, biceps femoris, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius lateralis and medialis muscles activity of 60 barefoot recreational runners with different foot structures was recorded while running at a speed of 3.3ÿm/s. Muscle activity was measured in the running cycle. Besides, muscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. The results showed that there were differences between groups with different foot type in muscle activity under different phases of running in some muscles. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the number of synergies was similar in different groups and the relative weight of muscles was not different across groups. In conclusion, despite the difference in muscle activity under different phases of the running cycle, muscle synergies are similar among the groups. This can indicate similar control by the central nervous system in runners with different arch structures while running and the observed changes in muscle activity can be attributed to the type of forces exerted on the body, the length-tension relationship, and changes in the direction of the lower limbs in people with different arch structures. ?

(2024),2024,Relationship between peroneus longus tendon graft thickness and anthropometric variables: a radiographic study using ultrasonography,"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of anthropometric measurements for two-stranded peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft thickness using ultrasonography Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on 204 healthy volunteers (102 males and 102 females) aged 18?40ÿyears. Anthropometric measurements were recorded, including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), fibular length, calf circumference, and ankle circumference. The Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) was used to assess activity levels. PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured using ultrasonography. Two-stranded PLT graft thickness was calculated using the previously reported formula by Luo etÿal. A thickness of less than 8ÿmm of PLT graft was accepted as an insufficient autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of two-stranded PLT graft thickness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to establish the best threshold values. Results: Males had a significantly greater PLT CSA (0.17 ñ 0.03 cm2) and predicted two-stranded PLT graft thickness (8.1 ñ 0.6ÿmm) compared with females (0.15 ñ 0.03 cm2 and 7.5 ñ 0.6ÿmm, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Correlation analysis revealed that two-stranded PLT graft thickness positively correlated with height, weight, BMI, fibular length, calf circumference, ankle circumference, and Tegner Activity Scale in both genders, with stronger correlations observed in females. The logistic regression model identified height and calf circumference as significant predictors of sufficient two-stranded PLT graft thickness (ò 8ÿmm) in males, while calf circumference and the TAS were significant predictors in females. ROC analysis demonstrated that calf circumference and the TAS had acceptable discriminatory abilities in females, with 36.25ÿcm and ò 4 cutoff points, respectively. However, no anthropometric variables in males exhibited strong discriminatory abilities for predicting two-stranded PLT graft thickness Conclusions: Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females. However, no anthropometric variables in males could be used strongly for prediction. These anthropometric measurements can assist in preoperative planning and decision-making, potentially improving ACLR outcomes by ensuring adequate graft thickness in females.

788,SC-171,Cho et al. (2024),2024,Effects of body mass index on ankle joint muscle function and dynamic proprioceptive control,"PURPOSE Increased body mass index (BMI) increases ankle instability and adversely affects human movement. This study aims to compare and analyze the muscle function and proprioception of the ankle joint based on Body Mass Index (BMI) to determine potential differences. METHODS Twenty-eight healthy male and female college students were categorized into overweight (ò BMI 23) and normal (< BMI 23) groups. Measurements included BMI, isokinetic strength of dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, eversion, inversion, ankle joint range of motion, and ankle joint proprioception. RESULTS In dorsiflexion, right 30ø/sec (p=.035), left 30ø/sec (p=.009) and right 120ø/sec (p=.011); in plantarflexion, left 30ø/sec (p<.001), right 120ø/sec (p=.007) and left 120ø/sec (p=.006) in ankle inversion, left 30ø/sec (p=.001), right 120ø/sec (p=.021) and left 120ø/sec (p=.007), left 30ø/sec (p=.014), 120ø/sec (p=.001) in ankle inversion-eversion ratio, right (p=.003) and left (p=.003) in ankle joint range of motion, right (p<.001) and left (p=.022) in total proprioception, and left (p<.001) in left-right proprioception were significantly different between the normal and overweight groups. CONCLUSIONS It was found that the overweight group had lower muscle strength, joint range of motion, and proprioceptive control function of the ankle joint than the normal group according to BMI. Therefore, exercise programs should be provided to strengthen the periarticular muscles involved in ankle movement, such as the tibialis anterior, soleus, and peroneus longus, and to control dynamic proprioception to prevent ankle injuries and function of the ankle joint according to BMI. ?

We introduce a new approach for Achilles tendon reconstruction using transversal calcaneal anchored autogenous semitendinosus tendon graft. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical role of this new Achilles tendon reconstruction. We retrospectively enrolled patients who underwent Achilles tendon reconstruction using transversal calcaneal anchored autogenous semitendinosus tendon graft for acute Achilles tendon rupture defects from 2016 to 2021. The clinical and radiological results were assessed at the preoperative and the final postoperative follow-up with Visual Analog Score (VAS) scores, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores and Achilles tendon Total Rupture Scores (ATRS). Besides, at the last postoperative follow-up, the difference in ankle range of motion between the two side of the patients and the incidence of postoperative complications were recorded. Results revealed patients had significantly lower VAS and higher AOFAS and ATRS (P < 0.01). Compared to the healthy ankle, the operative ankle showed significant deficits in ankle range of motion (P < 0.01). Additionally, radiological results showed no noticeable signs of tunnel enlargement in the calcaneus and no patient had re-rupture. Transversal calcaneal anchored Achilles tendon reconstruction with free semitendinosus tendon autograft is an effective treatment option for patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture with large defects and have high postoperative exercise demands. ?

790,SC-173,Yi et al. (2024),2024,A pathological joint?liver axis mediated by matrikine-activated CD4+ T cells,"The knee joint has long been considered a closed system. The pathological effects of joint diseases on distant organs have not been investigated. Herein, our clinical data showed that post-traumatic joint damage, combined with joint bleeding (hemarthrosis), exhibits a worse liver function compared with healthy control. With mouse model, hemarthrosis induces both cartilage degeneration and remote liver damage. Next, we found that hemarthrosis induces the upregulation in ratio and differentiation towards Th17 cells of CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood and spleen. Deletion of CD4+ T cells reverses hemarthrosis-induced liver damage. Degeneration of cartilage matrix induced by hemarthrosis upregulates serological type II collagen (COL II), which activates CD4+ T cells. Systemic application of a COL II antibody blocks the activation. Furthermore, bulk RNAseq and single-cell qPCR analysis revealed that the cartilage Akt pathway is inhibited by blood treatment. Intra-articular application of Akt activator blocks the cartilage degeneration and thus protects against the liver impairment in mouse and pig models. Taken together, our study revealed a pathological joint?liver axis mediated by matrikine-activated CD4+ T cells, which refreshes the organ-crosstalk axis and provides a new treatment target for hemarthrosis-related disease.

791,SC-174,He et al. (2024),2024,Impact of specialized fatigue and backhand smash on the ankle biomechanics of female badminton players,"During fatigued conditions, badminton players may experience adverse effects on their ankle joints during smash landings. In addition, the risk of ankle injury may vary with different landing strategies. This study aimed to investigate the influence of sport-specific fatigue factors and two backhand smash actions on ankle biomechanical indices. Thirteen female badminton players (age: 21.2 ñ 1.9ÿyears; height: 167.1 ñ 4.1ÿcm; weight: 57.3 ñ 5.1ÿkg; BMI: 20.54 ñ 1.57ÿkg/m2) participated in this study. An 8-camera Vicon motion capture system and three Kistler force platforms were used to collect kinematic and kinetic data before and after fatigue for backhand rear-court jump smash (BRJS) and backhand lateral jump smash (BLJS). A 2 ? 2 repeated measures analysis of variance was employed to analyze the effects of these smash landing actions and fatigue factors on ankle biomechanical parameters. Fatigue significantly affected the ankle-joint plantarflexion and inversion angles at the initial contact (IC) phase (p < 0.05), with both angles increasing substantially post-fatigue. From a kinetic perspective, fatigue considerably influenced the peak plantarflexion and peak inversion moments at the ankle joint, which resulted in a decrease the former and an increase in the latter after fatigue. The two smash landing actions demonstrated different landing strategies, and significant main effects were observed on the ankle plantarflexion angle, inversion angle, peak dorsiflexion/plantarflexion moment, peak inversion/eversion moment, and peak internal rotation moment (p < 0.05). The BLJS landing had a much greater landing inversion angle, peak inversion moment, and peak internal rotation moment compared with BRJS landing. The interaction effects of fatigue and smash actions significantly affected the muscle force of the peroneus longus (PL), with a more pronounced decrease in the force of the PL muscle post-fatigue in the BLJS action(post-hoc < 0.05). This study demonstrated that fatigue and smash actions, specifically BRJS and BLJS, significantly affect ankle biomechanical parameters. After fatigue, both actions showed a notable increase in IC plantarflexion and inversion angles and peak inversion moments, which may elevate the risk of lateral ankle sprains. Compared with BRJS, BLJS poses a higher risk of lateral ankle sprains after fatigue. ? The Author(s) 2024.",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-024-61141-z,Scientific Reports
792,SC-175,Zheng et al. (2024),2024,Investigation of inter-rater and test-retest reliability of Y balance test in college students with flexible flatfoot,"Background: The Lower Quarter Y Balance Test (YBT-LQ) has been widely used to assess dynamic balance in various populations. Dynamic balance in flexible flatfoot populations is one of the risk factors for lower extremity injuries, especially in college populations in which more exercise is advocated. However, no study has demonstrated the reliability of the YBT-LQ in a college student flexible flatfoot population. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study. 30 college students with flexible flatfoot were recruited from Beijing Sports University. They have been thrice assessed for the maximal reach distance of YBT under the support of the lower limb on the flatfoot side. Test and retest were performed with an interval of 14 days. The outcome measures using the composite score and normalized maximal reach distances in three directions (anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral). The relative reliability was reported as the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Minimal Detectable Change (MDC), Smallest worthwhile change (SWC), and Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) were used to report the absolute reliability. Results: For inter-rater reliability, the ICC values for all directions ranged from 0.84 to 0.92, SEM values ranged from 2.01 to 3.10%, SWC values ranged from 3.67 to 5.12%, and MDC95% values ranged from 5.58 to 8.60%. For test-retest reliability, the ICC values for all directions ranged from 0.81 to 0.92, SEM values ranged from 1.80 to 2.97%, SWC values ranged from 3.75 to 5.61%, and MDC95% values ranged from 4.98 to 8.24%. Conclusions: The YBT-LQ has ?good? to ?excellent? inter-rater and test-retest reliability. It appears to be a reliable assessment to use with college students with flexible flatfoot.

793,SC-176,Sprinchorn et al. (2024),2024,Differences and similarities in muscle architecture of fibularis longus and brevis?An observational descriptive cross-sectional and feasibility study,"Background: The fibularis longus (FL) muscle is larger in volume than fibularis brevis (FB) and is therefore claimed to be the stronger evertor of the two. Clinical observation of FL and FB tendon rupture show that injury to the FB has a serious negative effect on hindfoot eversion. This implies that the FB is the stronger and more important evertor. The strength of a muscle is not purely based on its volume, and the observed discrepancy between the FB and FL may be due to differences in muscle architecture. This study compares the muscle architecture of FL with FB. Methods: Sixteen legs from eight formaldehyde-fixed human specimens, mean age 83 (range 72?89) years, were dissected. The volume, fibre lengths and fibre pennation angles for both muscles were measured and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was calculated. Results: The FL was always larger than the FB, with an individual difference in volume that varied from 1.4 to 4.6 times larger with a mean difference of 17ÿml (95% CI 14?20; p < 0.001). Mean fibre lengths were 9ÿmm (95% CI 2?16; p = 0.015) longer in FL than in FB. The mean pennation angle was 9.6 degrees in FL and 8.8 degrees in FB, this difference was not significant (p = 0.32). The mean PCSA for FL was 3 cm2 (95% CI 2?4) larger than for FB (p < 0.001). Conclusions: With our sample set, the hypothesis that the muscle architecture can explain the clinical discrepancy between the FL and FB, was not supported. The difference in hindfoot eversion might instead depend on the different moment arms of FL and FB and the effect forefoot abduction has on hindfoot eversion. ? 2024, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s13018-024-04594-2,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research

At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups. Results: All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P > 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the gait cycle parameters, including the percentage of time in the stance, mid-stance, and push-off phases, as well as foot strike angle and push-off angle (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Through our study of the surgical experimental group we have shown that harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon does not affect foot morphology and gait parameters; however, it does impact the gait cycle. ? 2024, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s13018-023-04429-6,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research

(2024),2024,Effect of Cranial Cruciate Ligament Transection during TPLO on Patellar Desmitis in Dogs with Partial Cranial Cruciate Ligament Rupture,"Objective The aim of this study was to assess the protective effect of transecting a partially ruptured cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) during tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO) surgery on postoperative patellar ligament thickness (PLT) and shortening. Study Design Dogs with partial CCL rupture that underwent a unilateral TPLO were included. The population was divided into two groups: remnant CCL transected (study group) and left in situ (control group). Preoperative and 6-week postoperative measurements of PLT, in three specific locations, and patellar ligament length (PLL) were collected. Risk factors for PLT and shortening were also included. Results Fifty-two dogs (56 stifles) with partial CCL rupture were retrospectively included. Twenty-nine stifles (51.8%) had the remnant CCL transected (study group) and 27 stifles (48.2%) had the remnant CCL left in situ (control group). Significant differences were found on PLT measurements between pre- and 6-week post-surgery for all three ligament locations with greatest difference at the middle region. Median PLL was significantly shorter 6-week post-surgery for both groups. No significant differences in PLT nor PLL were identified between procedures where the remnant was transected or not. Conclusion This study did not identify a protective effect of transecting the CCL remnant on PLT or patellar ligament shortening, contrary to other reports within the literature. Further investigation is needed in the form of prospective studies with higher number of cases to understand the clinical implications of patellar ligament thickening and shortening in dogs. ? 2024 Georg Thieme Verlag.

796,SC-179,Hassan et al. (2024),2024,"Hematological profile among cutaneous leishmaniasis patients before and after treatment with sodium stibogluconate in Diyala, Iraq","Introduction: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a common protozoan disease in Iraq characterized by localized ulcers, primarily on exposed skin. This study aimed to investigate the hematological parameters of infected patients using a complete blood count (CBC) in the endemic area of Diyala Governorate, northeast of Baghdad. This has been studied in newly diagnosed, untreated individuals and patients receiving sodium antimony gluconate. Methodology: Hematological screening was performed on blood samples from 161 patients with microscopically diagnosed cutaneous leishmaniasis before and after treatment. Anti-Leishmania IgG was also assessed by ELISA in seropositive and seronegative subjects. Results: The newly diagnosed, untreated patients showed no significant differences in blood cell counts, whereas treated patients had significant changes in white blood cell composition, including absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute monocytes (MID), eosinophils Granulocytes and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), platelets count (PLT) and Mean Platelets Volume (MPV), following the administration of five consecutive sodium stibogluconate injection. In addition, the anti-Leishmania IgG seroprevalence was highest (85%) in the newly diagnosed, untreated group and gradually decreased with continued treatment. However, there was no significant difference in red blood cell components including red blood cells (RBC), hematocrit test (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red cell distribution width (RDW) before and after treatment. Conclusions: The current data gave an insight into certain hematological factors regarding WBC subtypes, along with cutaneous leishmaniasis treatment. In addition, the anti-Leishmania IgG may be considered a marker for therapeutic monitoring. ? ? 2024 Hassan et al.",Scopus,10.3855/jidc.18962,Journal of Infection in Developing Countries
797,SC-180,Chai et al. (2024),2024,Cortical Changes of Dual Cognitive-Task Balance Training in Patients With Chronic Ankle Instability: A Randomized Trial,"Context: Researchers have shown that patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI) have deficits in memory and attention allocation. This functional deficit affects lower extremity performance. Motor-cognitive dual-task training may improve lower limb dysfunction caused by central nervous system injury. Further study is needed to determine whether dual-task training is more favorable than single-task training for improving neuromuscular control in patients with CAI. Objective: To compare the effects of balance-cognition dual-task training and balance single-task training on lower limb function and electroencephalography changes during static postural control in patients with CAI. Design: Randomized clinical trial (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2300073875). Setting: Rehabilitation training room. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 24 patients with CAI (age ¬ 22.33 6 2.43 years, height ¬ 175.62 6 7.7 cm, mass ¬ 70.63 6 14.59 kg) were block randomized into 2 groups. Intervention(s): Protocols were performed 3 times per week for 6 weeks. The single-task group underwent 1-legged static balance training with eyes open and closed and hopping balance training. The dual-task group underwent balance and cognitive training (backward-counting task). Main Outcome Measure(s): Cortical activity, proprioception, muscle onset time (difference between the muscle activation time and touchdown time), and dynamic balance were assessed before and after the interventions. We performed multivariate analyses of variance to identify main effects and interactions across groups and time. A post hoc Bonferroni test was performed for pairwise comparisons when interactions were present. Results: All participants successfully completed the 6-week interventions. Proprioception, peroneus longus (PL) muscle onset time, and dynamic postural control improved after the interventions in both groups (P, .05). Dual-task training was superior to single-task training in improving joint position sense in plantar flexion, shortening PL muscle onset time, and altering cortical activity (P, .05). Conclusions: A 6-week program of balance training or balance combined with cognitive training could improve the functional deficits associated with CAI. The dual-task training could also improve joint position sense in plantar flexion, PL muscle onset time, and cortical activity. ? by the National Athletic Trainers?

798,SC-181,Arora et al. (2024),2024,Lower Limb Length and Body Weight are Surrogate Predictors of Peroneus Longus Autograft Diameter,"Introduction: Graft diameters are essential in any ACL surgery, with diameters less than 8mm associated with higher revision rates. Peroneus longus (PL) grafts have garnered much attention recently due to ease of harvest and more reliable graft diameters. The present study aimed to study various anthropometric parameters associated with PL-graft diameters. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of 50 patients undergoing PL harvest for ACL surgery at a tertiary referral hospital. Age, gender, height, weight, length of the lower leg (lateral tibial plateau to the tip of the fibula), circumference at the head of the fibula and girth at the lateral malleolus were measured pre-operatively. The length of the graft doubled and tripled graft diameters were assessed intra-operatively. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the association between the pre-operative anthropometric variables and the intra-operative graft diameters and length of graft harvested. Results: The mean doubled and tripled PL-graft diameter in our study population was 7.7 ñ 0.9 mm and 8.7 ñ 0.8 mm, respectively. The mean length of the graft was 25.9 ñ 3.5 cm. We found no significant correlation between graft diameters and age, gender or height of the patient. We found that the patient's weight significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with graft diameter. We also found that the length of the lower leg (p < 0.0001), circumference at the head of the fibula (p = 0.001) and girth at the lateral malleolus (p = 0.029) showed significant correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter. Conclusion: We found that weight, length of the lower leg and girth at the head of the fibula showed a strong correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter. ?

(2024),2024,"Anterior cruciate ligament injuries in elite badminton athletes: 84% Return to sport, half return to performance","Purpose: Badminton requires fast and pivoting movements, putting athletes at risk of sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The primary purpose is to investigate the return to sport (RTS) and the return to performance (RTP) after an ACL injury in elite badminton athletes. The secondary purpose is to describe ACL injury mechanisms in elite badminton players. Methods: Athletes within the top 200 of the Badminton World Federation World Ranking who sustained an ACL injury between January 2001 and December 2021 were retrospectively included. An anonymous online survey was created in eight languages. RTS, RTP and contributing factors were analysed among athletes aiming to RTP. The injury mechanism was analysed in all participants. Results: Sixty-six athletes from 32 countries were included. Fifty-seven athletes (86.4%) aimed to RTP. Forty-eight out of 57 (84.2%) did RTS. Twenty-nine (50.9%) managed to successfully RTP. Forty-nine (74.2%) of ACL injuries occurred during a competition, 14 (21.2%) occured during training. Thirty-one (49.2%) occurred in the rear court backhand side and 47 (74.6%) occurred during landing after a jump. Conclusion: Forty-eight out of 57 (84.2%) athletes managed to RTS. Half of the athletes managed to successfully RTP. Most of the ACL injuries occurred during competition, in the rear court backhand sideÿand during landing after a jump.

Sixty legs from 30 cadavers were examined. The plantar, dorsal, and medial first tarsometatarsal ligaments were classified by fiber bundle number, and their morphological characteristics (fiber bundle length, width, thickness) were measured. The FL was categorized by its continuity with the plantar first tarsometatarsal ligament (PTML): Type A, connection with the PTML only on the first metatarsal; Type B, connection along the entire PTML; and Type C, no connection with the PTML. The severity of articular cartilage degeneration was assessed in four stages. No significant differences in cartilage degeneration among ligament types were found. Negative correlations were observed between the fiber bundle width and thickness of the PTML and the severity of cartilage degeneration. FL was classified as Type A in 68%, Type B in 27%, and Type C in 5% of feet. The fiber bundle thickness of the PTML in Type B was greater than in other types. Our findings suggest that smaller fiber bundle width and thickness in the PTML may be associated with severe cartilage degeneration. The FL had continuity with the PTML in 95% of feet and could enhance the mechanical strength of the PTML in Type B feet. ? 2024 American Association of Clinical Anatomists and British Association of Clinical Anatomists.",Scopus,10.1002/ca.24167,Clinical Anatomy

Methods: Data from the Natural Corollaries and Recovery after ACL injury multicenter longitudinal cohort study were analyzed. Between May 2016 and October 2018, patients aged between 15 and 40ÿyears, who had experienced an ACL tear within the last 6ÿweeks and sought medical attention at one of seven healthcare clinics in Sweden, were invited to participate. The mean time from injury to MRI was 19.6 ñ 15.2ÿdays. An orthopedic knee surgeon and a musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed all the MRI scans. The following structures were assessed: posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) complex, lateral collateral ligament (LCL), popliteus tendon, medial meniscus (MM), lateral meniscus (LM), and cartilage. In addition, the presence of bone bruising, impaction fractures in the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) or posterolateral tibia (PLT), and Segond fractures were also assessed. Results: A total of 254 patients (48.4% males) with a mean age of 25.4 ñ 7.1 years were included. The prevalence of associated injuries was as follows: PCL (0.4%), MCL {41.3% [superficial MCL and deep MCL (dMCL) 16.5%; isolated dMCL 24.8%]}, LCL (2.4%), MM (57.4%), LM (25.2%), cartilage (15.0%), bone bruising (92.9%), impaction fracture in the LFC (45.7%) and PLT (4.7%), and Segond fracture (7.5%). Conclusions: The prevalence of associated injuries in patients with ACL tears was high.

(2024),2024,Short-erm clinical outcomes of meniscal reconstruction with autologous peroneus longus tendon; ???????????????????,"Objective To evaluate the short-term clinical outcomes of meniscus reconstruction using autologous peroneus longus tendon grafts. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 20 patients (12 males, 8 females) with a mean age of 37.8ñ5.7 years (range, 31-47 years) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.3ñ5.8 kg/m2 (range, 20.1-31.3 kg/m2) who underwent meniscal reconstruction with autologous peroneus longus tendon in Affiliated Xinhua Hospital of Dalian University from June 2020 to June 2022. A control group of 20 patients (15 males, 5 females), with a mean age of 39.1ñ6.2 years (range, 32-47 years) and a mean BMI of 25.6ñ5.4 kg/m2 (range, 20.2-32.7 kg/m2), underwent partial meniscectomy during the same period. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The morphology and signal intensity of grafts, Recht grading for cartilage damage, and the need for secondary arthroscopy were also evaluated. Results The mean follow-up duration was 24.3ñ4.3 months for the tendon graft group and 24.2ñ3.6 months for the partial meniscectomy group. At 3 and 6 months postoperatively, the partial meniscectomy group demonstrated superior knee function scores compared to the tendon graft group (P<0.05). Similarly, VAS were lower in the partial meniscectomy group at 3 months postoperatively (P<0.05), although no significant difference was found at 6 months (P>0.05). By 12 months postoperatively, differences in pain and function between the two groups were no longer statistically significant (P>0.05). At 24 months, the tendon graft group exhibited significantly better outcomes in terms of the Lysholm score (84.31ñ12.20 vs. 72.67ñ14.18), IKDC score (82.21ñ10.55 vs. 74.09ñ11.68), VAS score (2.10ñ1.74 vs. 3.80ñ1.81), and KOOS score (85.37ñ13.14 vs.75.14ñ17.94) compared to the partial meniscectomy group (P<0.05). Regarding graft healing, 19 patients in the tendon graft group demonstrated a grade 3 graft-residual meniscus complex at 24 months, significantly improved from 5 patients at 3 months postoperatively. Furthermore, no grafts showed a grade 3 signal intensity at 3 months, while 19 patients showed such improvements by 24 months. MRI at the 24-month follow-up revealed cartilage damage in 7 patients in the tendon graft group and 20 patients in the partial meniscectomy group, with severe cartilage damage (Recht grade>II) observed in 1 patient in the tendon graft group and 7 patients in the partial meniscectomy group. All 20 patients in the tendon graft group achieved minimal clinically significant differences by 24 months, and 4 of them underwent secondary arthroscopy, which revealed vascularization between the graft and residual meniscal tissue. Conclusion The use of the peroneus longus tendon for meniscal reconstruction reduces knee pain, enhances knee function, and effectively fills the tibiofemoral joint space while protecting the articular cartilage through graft remodeling. ? 2024 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

(2024),2024,Hormonal Fluctuation and Ankle Instability in Women?Is There a Correlation?,"Background: With higher incidences of ankle sprains and chronic ankle instability in women, it has been postulated that hormonal modulation and ligamentous laxity influences injury propensity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of hormonal fluctuation on ankle stability and ligamentous laxity and their potential contribution to injury propensity in the female athlete. Methods: In November 2023, a systematic review of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Articles were included if they were published after the year 2000, evaluated outcomes related to the impact of hormones on ankle stability in healthy patients, and included menstrual tracking. The following search terms were used: ?(sex or gender) AND (ankle stability)? and ?(hormone) AND (ankle).? Results: Thirteen articles were included, with 253 (76.4%) women at a weighted mean age of 21.9 ñ 2.0 years (range, 20.0-25.9). Five studies evaluated postural sway and balance noting greater sway rates during ovulation compared with the follicular phase. Greater muscle tone (P <.001) was observed in the follicular phase than ovulation for the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and lateral gastrocnemius. Significantly higher ankle joint laxity was observed in ovulation (P =.016). Conclusion: This review found that during ovulation, when estrogen peaks, subjects showed impaired balance with higher postural sway rates, greater ankle joint laxity, and decreased muscle and ligamentous tone and stiffness?an indicator of laxity. An underlying hormonally mediated etiology for the increased propensity to ankle instability in the female athlete is suggested. Syncing an athlete?s workout type and intensity around menstrual cycle phase may be an advantageous strategy for injury prevention. ?

Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at the orthopedic department of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission General Hospital, Islamabad, from July 2021 to July 2023. A total of 150 patients aged between 20 and 40 years with an anterior cruciate ligament injury requiring ligament reconstruction were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included previous ankle ligamentous injuries, fractures or surgeries around the ankle, and high-risk sports like football. After the ACLR surgery, the patients were assessed for pain, range of motion (ROM), and muscle power in the 6th week, 3rd month, and 6th month. Return to jogging without discomfort at the ankle during 1st min of jogging was assessed at six months. Results: Of the 150 patients, 142 (94.6%) were male and 8 (5.4%) were female. The mean age of participants was 32.53 ñ 4.78 years. Pain and loss of ROM around the ankle were reduced after six months compared to three months and six weeks, that is, P < 0.05. Muscle power was increased after six months (n = 152; 94.0%) (P < 0.001). In the 6th month, 133 patients (88.7%) were able to jog without discomfort around the ankle joint during the 1st min of jogging, but 17 patients (11.3%) started jogging after six months without discomfort at the ankle joint during the 1st min of jogging (P < 0.001). Conclusion: ACLR using the PLT autograft resulted in a good functional outcome, smooth rehabilitation with an early return to sports, and minimal complications at the donor site. ? 2024 Published by Scientific Scholar.",Scopus,10.25259/JMSR_165_2024,Journal of Musculoskeletal Surgery and Research

This study aims to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive corrective exercise program (CCEP) on the range of motion, proprioception, dynamic balance, and muscle activation in female athletes with limited weight-bearing lunge ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. 30 female athletes aged 15 to 25 years with dorsiflexion under 34ø were randomized to two groups. The intervention group (n = 15) received eight weeks of CCEP including soft tissue mobilization, joint mobilization, stretching, and strengthening, and the control (n = 15) group did not receive any intervention. range of motion, proprioception, dynamic balance, and muscle activation were assessed before and after the intervention. The training group showed clinically acceptable and statistically significant changes in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ES = 0.714), balance (ES = 0.423), and proprioception (ES = 0.253; P < 0.05). There were significant changes in the activity of the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles in the dynamic overhead squat test (descending and ascending phases) and the activity of the medial gastrocnemius in the descending phase decreased significantly (P < 0.05). No significant change was observed in the activity of the peroneus longus muscle (P > 0.05). The findings show that CCEP appears to be beneficial in increasing dorsiflexion range of motion, proprioception, balance, and decreasing ankle muscle activity among individuals with limited ankle dorsiflexion. Improving the dorsiflexion range of motion may be promising for reducing ankle sprain injury.

(2024),2024,Effect of Task Constraints on Neurobiological Systems Involved in Postural Control in Individuals with and without Chronic Ankle Instability,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of task constraints on the neurobiological systems while maintaining postural control under various sensory feedback manipulations in individuals with and without Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI). Forty-two physically active individuals, with and without CAI, were enrolled in a case-control study conducted at a biomechanics research laboratory. All participants underwent the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), which assesses individuals? ability to integrate somatosensory, visual, and vestibular feedback to maintain postural control in double-, uninjured-, and injured-limb stances under six different conditions in which variations in the sway-referenced support surface (platform) and visual surroundings, with and without vision, are manipulated to affect somatosensory and visual feedback. Center-of-Pressure (COP) path length was computed from raw data collected during trials of each SOT condition. Sample Entropy (SampEN) values were extracted from the COP path length time series to examine neurobiological systems complexity, with lower SampEN values indicating more predictable and periodic (rigid) neurobiological systems, while higher SampEN values indicate more unpredictable and random systems. The results show that specific task constraints affect the neurobiological systems. Specifically, individuals with CAI demonstrated reduced complexity (decreased SampEN values) in the neurobiological systems during the uninjured-limb stance when all sensory feedback was intact and during both uninjured- and injured-limb stances when they were forced to rely on vestibular feedback. These results highlight the interplay between sensory feedback and task constraints in individuals with CAI and suggest potential adaptations in the neurobiological systems involved in postural control. ? 2024 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/bioengineering11100956,Bioengineering

Design: This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial. Thirty-six individuals with chronic ankle instability were randomly assigned to each group. Participants received 6-wk neuromuscular electrical stimulation intervention and sham stimulation in the neuromuscular electrical stimulation and control groups, respectively. Data were collected at week<inf>0</inf> and week<inf>6</inf>. A mixed-effects model and analysis of covariance were employed to investigate the between-group differences in continuous and discrete outcome variables at week<inf>6</inf>, with the outcome variables at week<inf>0</inf> as covariates. Results: Compared to control group, neuromuscular electrical stimulation group exhibited a 2.66ø (2.45, 2.86) reduction in frontal ankle inversion angle, a 47.41ø/sec (?16.05, ?78.77) decrease in peak ankle inversion angular velocity, and a 0.43 Nm/kg (0.18, 0.68) increase in peak ankle eversion moment during drop landing at week<inf>6</inf>. Conclusions: Applying 6-wk neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the fibularis longus resulted in decreased ankle inversion angle and ankle inversion angular velocity and increased peak ankle eversion moment during drop landing. Consequently, neuromuscular electrical stimulation could be considered an effective modality for individuals with chronic ankle instability to enhance the frontal ankle movement patterns and overall ankle motor control. ? ? 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

812,SC-195,Esmer et al. (2024),2024,Muscular Activation Levels of Subjects with Low Medial Longitudinal Arch During Single-Leg Squat and Single-Leg Balancing Exercises on Surfaces of Different Hardness,"Background: The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of the stiffness of rehabilitation material on muscle activation in individuals with low medial longitudinal arch. The secondary aim is to compare the effects of single-leg balancing and single-leg squat exercises on the activation of the muscles around the ankle in the same individuals. Methods: Twelve individuals with low medial longitudinal arch and 18 healthy control participants were included. Participants were asked to perform the single-leg balance and single-leg squat exercises on Theraband stability trainers of three different stiffness levels. Activation of the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, tibialis anterior, medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles during exercises was evaluated by surface electromyography. Results: The single-leg balancing exercise performed on soft and very soft ground was more effective than single-leg squat in increasing the activation of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle in participants with a low medial longitudinal arch. It was determined that performing single-leg squat exercise on a very soft surface instead of hard ground caused more muscular activation in the peroneus brevis, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius in the same individuals. Conclusions: The exercise progression to be applied on different surfaces to increase the activation of the muscles around the ankle in individuals with a low medial longitudinal arch and in healthy individuals without a low medial longitudinal arch was different. ? 2024, American Podiatric Medical Association.

(2024),2024,Postoperative Multimodal Approach to Pain Control in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Autograft Surgery: A Single-Center Series,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are prevalent and represent a significant socioeconomic burden, as ACL injuries account for nearly 60% of all knees joint traumas. The purpose of this study is to emphasize the role of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and the challenges in postoperative pain management. Methods: This study involved 90 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, categorized into three groups receiving different pain management protocols. The focus was on evaluating the efficacy of multimodal analgesia using lidocaine and magnesium sulfate. The main outcome was pain assessment using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Results: Patients receiving fentanyl, lidocaine, and magnesium sulfate (FLM) reported significantly lower pain scores in the postoperative period. Minimal use of additional opioids was observed, suggesting effective pain management with the multimodal analgesia regimen. Conclusions: The study showed that multimodal analgesia, including FLM, effectively manages postoperative pain following ACL reconstruction. This study showed significantly lower pain scores with FLM, highlighting its potential in early postoperative pain relief. Future research should consider long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive evaluations of multimodal analgesia?s impact. ? 2024 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/surgeries5030052,Surgeries (Switzerland)
814,SC-197,Vyacheslavovich et al. (2024),2024,Comparative Analysis of the Six-Strand Hamstring and Peroneus Longus in Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is crucial for knee stability and is often injured in sports, leading to significant issues like degenerative changes and meniscal tears. ACL tears are prevalent in high-school sports injuries, accounting for 50% of knee injuries in the U.S. Surgical reconstruction, often involving bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or hamstring autografts, is common, with varying success rates and complications. Emerging alternatives like the peroneus longus tendon show promise but require further comparative studies. This prospective and multicentric study included 110 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction from 2020 to 2022. Fifty-five patients received hamstring tendon autografts (Group H) and fifty-five received peroneus longus tendon autografts (Group P). Surgeries were performed by experienced surgeons using standardized techniques. Patients were evaluated using clinical tests and functional scores including the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire and IKDC-2000 at various postoperative intervals up to 24 months. Data were analyzed using SPSS with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Group H showed superior knee function preoperatively and at 24 months postoperatively compared to Group P. Group H had higher Lysholm and IKDC scores consistently throughout the study period. The anterior drawer and Lachman?s tests indicated better knee stability for Group H. Complications were comparable between groups, with specific issues related to donor site morbidity and muscle weakness observed in each. The six-strand hamstring tendon autograft (Group H) demonstrated superior functional outcomes and knee stability compared to the peroneus longus tendon autograft (Group P) for ACL reconstruction. Despite some donor site morbidity, the hamstring tendon showed better long-term recovery and fewer complications. Future studies should explore larger, multicentric cohorts and integrate regenerative medicine techniques to further enhance ACL reconstruction outcomes. ? 2024 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/surgeries5030063,Surgeries (Switzerland)

(2024),2024,Blood Flow Restriction Training Improves Muscular Outcomes in Patients With Chronic Ankle Instability: A Critically Appraised Topic,"Clinical Scenario: The high recurrence of lateral ankle sprains progresses to chronic ankle instability (CAI) and can affect many athletes in all sports. CAI is often associated with a decrease in muscle strength, an increase in pain, a decrease in the range of motion, and a decrease in balance or neuromuscular control. The use of blood flow restriction (BFR) with CAI can increase muscular outcomes and be used as a rehabilitation tool. Clinical Question: Is there evidence to suggest that BFR improves strength, muscle activation, and/or cross-sectional area of the lower leg musculature in those with CAI? Clinical Bottom Line: There is moderate evidence to support therapeutic exercise with low-intensity BFR in patients with CAI. The evidence concluded a significant improvement in BFR to increase muscle activation of the fibularis longus, anterior tibialis, vastus lateralis, and soleus. There is moderate evidence suggesting BFR can induce strength gains in the muscles of the lower extremity in patients with CAI. Strength of Recommendation: The comprehensive evidence is a Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) Grade B, with a level of evidence of 2, according to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) for the studies included. ? 2024 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/ijatt.2023-0094,International Journal of Athletic Therapy and Training
816,SC-199,Chen et al. (2024),2024,Diagnosis and treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries: Consensus of Chinese experts part II: Graft selection and clinical outcome evaluation,"Background: In the recent decade, there has been substantial progress in the technologies and philosophies associated with diagnosing and treating anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in China. The therapeutic efficacy of ACL reconstruction in re-establishing the stability of the knee joint has garnered widespread acknowledgment. However, the path toward standardizing diagnostic and treatment protocols remains to be further developed and refined. Objective: In this context, the Chinese Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (CAOS) and the Chinese Society of Sports Medicine (CSSM) collaboratively developed an expert consensus on diagnosing and treating ACL injury, aiming to enhance medical quality through refining professional standards. Methods: The consensus drafting team invited experts across the Greater China region, including the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, to formulate and review the consensus using a modified Delphi method as a standardization approach. As members of the CSSM Lower Limb Study Group and the CAOS Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine Study Group, invited experts concentrated on two pivotal issues: ?Graft Selection? and ?Clinical Outcome Evaluation? during the second part of the consensus development. Results: This focused discussion ultimately led to a strong consensus on nine specific consensus terms. Conclusion: The consensus clearly states that ACL reconstruction has no definitive ?gold standard? graft choice. Autografts have advantages in healing capability but are limited in availability and have potential donor site morbidities; allografts reduce surgical trauma but incur additional costs, and there are concerns about slow healing, quality control issues, and a higher failure rate in young athletes; synthetic ligaments allow for early rehabilitation and fast return to sport, but the surgery is technically demanding and incurs additional costs. When choosing a graft, one should comprehensively consider the graft's characteristics, the doctor's technical ability, and the patient's needs. When evaluating clinical outcomes, it is essential to ensure an adequate sample size and follow-up rate, and the research should include patient subjective scoring, joint function and stability, complications, surgical failure, and the return to sport results. Medium and long-term follow-ups should not overlook the assessment of knee osteoarthritis. ? 2024",Scopus,10.1016/j.jot.2024.07.002,Journal of Orthopaedic Translation
817,SC-200,Beyraghi et al. (2024),2024,Reduction in preparatory brain activity preceding gait initiation in individuals with chronic ankle instability: A movement-related cortical potential study,"Evidence suggests that chronic ankle instability (CAI) is not merely a peripheral musculoskeletal injury but should be recognized as a neurophysiological dysfunction. This reflects a paradigm shift from focusing on peripheral structural changes to emphasizing the central nervous system. However, changes in cortical activity during functional activities remain poorly understood. Thus, this study aimed to compare preparatory brain activity during gait initiation (GI) through movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) in individuals with CAI and healthy subjects. The proactive components of MRCPs, including contingent negative variation (CNV) and event-related desynchronization (ERD), were measured using electroencephalography. The primary outcomes were late CNV amplitude, CNV peak amplitude, CNV peak time, and alpha/beta ERD. The results indicated that the late CNV amplitude was significantly lower in the CAI group compared to the healthy group at the Fz and Cz electrodes (Pÿ< 0.001). The CAI group also demonstrated lower CNV peak amplitude at the Fz, Cz, and Pz electrodes (Pÿ< 0.0025). Additionally, in the CAI group, signals peaked earlier at the Cz electrode (Pÿ= 0.002). Furthermore, alpha ERD at Pz was significantly lower in the CAI group than in the healthy group (Pÿ= 0.003), suggesting diminished preparatory brain activity during GI in CAI subjects. Recognizing CAI as a condition involving both peripheral and central dysfunctions highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in treatment and rehabilitation. This approach should target brain activity in addition to peripheral structures, potentially leading to improved long-term outcomes for patients. ? 2024 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Scopus,10.1111/ejn.16501,European Journal of Neuroscience
818,SC-201,Xu et al. (2024),2024,Contribution of ankle motion pattern during landing to reduce the knee-related injury risk,"Background: Single-leg landing (SL) is an essential technique in sports such as basketball, soccer, and volleyball, which is often associated with a high risk of knee-related injury. The ankle motion pattern plays a crucial role in absorbing the load shocks during SL, but the effect on the knee joint is not yet clear. This work aims to explore the effects of different ankle plantarflexion angles during SL on the risk of knee-related injury. Methods: Thirty healthy male subjects were recruited to perform SL biomechanics tests, and one standard subject was selected to develop the finite element model of foot-ankle-knee integration. The joint impact force was used to evaluate the impact loads on the knee at various landing angles. The internal load forces (musculoskeletal modeling) and stress (finite element analysis) around the knee joint were simulated and calculated to evaluate the risk of knee-related injury during SL. To more realistically revert and simulate the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury mechanics, we developed a knee musculoskeletal model that reverts the ACL ligament to a nonlinear short-term viscoelastic mechanical mechanism (strain rate-dependent) generated by the dense connective tissue as a function of strain. Results: As the ankle plantarflexion angle increased during landing, both the peak knee vertical impact force (p = 0.001) and ACL force (p = 0.001) decreased significantly. The maximum von Mises stress of ACL, meniscus, and femoral cartilage decreased as the ankle plantarflexion angle increased. The overall range of variation in ACL stress was small and was mainly distributed in the femoral and tibial attachment regions, as well as in the mid-lateral region. Conclusion: The current findings revealed that the use of larger ankle plantarflexion angles during landing may be an effective solution to reduce knee impact load and the risk of rupture of the medial femoral attachment area in the ACL. The findings of this study have the potential to offer novel perspectives in the optimized application of landing strategies, thus giving crucial theoretical backing for decreasing the risk of knee-related injury. ? 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108965,Computers in Biology and Medicine
819,SC-202,Qiao et al. (2024),2024,Comparing Ultrasound and MRI Evaluations of the Hamstring Tendon for Predicting Autograft Size in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Background: Adequate graft size and length are crucial factors in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Accurate identification of patients who may be at risk for an insufficient length or size of the hamstring tendon (HT) can aid surgeons in preoperative planning. Purpose: To evaluate whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound could more accurately predict the size of the semitendinosus tendon (ST) and gracilis tendon (GT) and to investigate the correlation between anthropometry, graft size, and imaging measurements to find a predictive formula. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Included in the study were 36 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with HT autograft at our institution between July 2021 and May 2022. Anthropometric data and MRI and ultrasound measurements were collected preoperatively. The length and diameter of the HT were recorded intraoperatively. Correlations between anthropometry, graft size, and imaging measurements were analyzed. Linear regression analysis was performed to construct a prediction formula. Results: The intraoperative graft diameters of the ST and GT were weakly to moderately associated with their cross-sectional areas as measured by MRI and ultrasound. MRI and ultrasound interpreted 11.9% to 15.7% and 18.4% to 41.7% of the variation in the graft diameter of the HT, with an accuracy of 50.0% to 55.6% and 69.4% to 86.1%, respectively. The intraoperative lengths of the ST and GT were both associated with patient height and tendon lengths as measured by ultrasound. Additionally, intraoperative GT length was associated with patient weight. Four formulas combining relevant anthropometric parameters and imaging measurements were calculated from multilinear regression analysis, explaining up to 46.3% of the variance in the size of HT. Conclusion: Ultrasound and MRI alone showed limited ability to predict the graft diameter of the ST and GT, while ultrasound could more accurately predict the graft size than MRI. Among the different anthropometric variables, height was the most influential in predicting tendon length. ?

820,SC-203,Lee et al. (2024),2024,Visual Disruption and Neuromechanics During Landing-Cutting in Individuals With Chronic Ankle Instability,"Context: Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) demonstrate altered movement patterns when their vision is disturbed during simple tasks, such as single-legged standing and walking. However, it remains unclear whether visual disruption by stroboscopic glasses alters movement patterns during landing-cutting movements, considered highly demanding sport maneuvers that mimic a typical athletic movement. Objectives: To identify altered lower extremity kinematics and muscle activation when vision is disrupted by stroboscopic glasses during landing-cutting tasks in individuals with CAI. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 18 individuals with CAI (age = 22.3 ñ 2.3 years, height = 1.75 ñ 0.1 m, mass = 72.5 ñ 9.8 kg) and 18 matched healthy controls (age = 21.7 ñ 2.3 years, height = 1.75 ñ 0.1 m, mass = 71.9 ñ 10.3 kg). Intervention(s): All participants performed 5 trials of a landing-cutting task with (SV) and without (NSV) stroboscopic glasses. Main Outcome Measure(s): Frontal- and sagittal-plane lower extremity kinematics and 6 lower extremity muscle activations during the stance phase of a landing-cutting task in the SV and NSV conditions. Results: Individuals with CAI demonstrated more ankleinversion angle from 18% to 22% and from 60% to 100% of the stance phase and more peroneus longus activation from initial contact to 18% of the stance phase under the SV condition than under the NSV condition. We observed no differences in knee- and hip-joint angles between the visual conditions for both groups. Conclusions: When wearing stroboscopic glasses, individuals with CAI showed altered movement patterns, including increased ankle-inversion angle and peroneus longus activation during the stance phase of a landing-cutting task. The results suggest that they may lack the ability to reweight sensory information to adapt their movement to visual disruption. ? 2024 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

821,SC-204,Farey et al. (2024),2024,Outcomes of ACL Reconstruction Utilizing Supercritical CO2-Sterilized Allografts,"Background: Allograft tendons are perceived to have a high ACL graft failure rate in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO<inf>2</inf>) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO<inf>2</inf>-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. Hypothesis: ACLR with SCCO<inf>2</inf> allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO<inf>2</inf>-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL?Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. Results: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 ñ 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged ó25 years (P =.007). Neither donor age (ó40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P >.05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. Conclusion: SCCO<inf>2</inf> processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft. ?

After geometric reconstruction of the foot skeleton from claw toe images of a 36?year-old male patient, two implants were positioned, in the virtual model, one neutral implant (NI) and another one 10ø angled (10øAI) within the PIPJ of the second through fourth HT during the toe-off phase of gait and results were compared to those derived for the non-surgical foot (NSF). A PIPJA was performed on the second toe using a NI reduced tensile stress at the proximal phalanx (PP) (45.83 MPa) compared to the NSF (59.44 MPa; p < 0.001). When using the 10øAI, the tensile stress was much higher at PP and middle phalanges (MP) of the same toe, measuring 147.58 and 160.58 MPa, respectively, versus 59.44 and 74.95 MPa at corresponding joints in the NSF (all p < 0.001). Similar results were found for compressive stresses. The NI reduced compressive stress at the second PP (?65.12 MPa) compared to the NSF (?113.23 MPa) and the 10øAI (?142 MPa) (all p < 0.001). The von Mises stresses within the implant were also significantly lower when using NI versus 10øAI (p < 0.001). Therefore, we do not recommend performing a PIPJA using the 10øAI due to the increase in stress concentration primarily at the second PP and MP, which could promote implant breakage. ? 2024 The Author(s).

(2024),2024,The Posteromedial Approach for Harvesting Hamstring Autografts Results in Fewer Incidents of Saphenous Nerve Injury Compared to the Conventional Anteromedial Approach: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: The hamstring autograft can be harvested using various skin incisions, such as vertical, transverse, and oblique incisions, and from different localizations, including anteromedial and posteromedial harvest sites. The aim of this study was to compare studies on the anteromedial and posteromedial approaches for hamstring autograft harvest in terms of clinical outcomes, saphenous nerve injury, infection, operative time, graft length, incision length, range of motion, and patient satisfaction. Methods: Following the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus, focusing on studies comparing anteromedial and posterior approaches for hamstring harvest. This study was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023450249). Methodological quality was evaluated using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) quantified dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. Results: Five articles, involving 405 knees, underwent analysis. Four studies were level 3 evidence, while 1 was level 1. The anteromedial hamstring harvest showed higher rates of saphenous nerve injury (OR, 9.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.19?43.65; p = 0.003) and longer operative times, with an MD of about 13 minutes (MD, 13.33; 95% CI, 0.68?25.97; p = 0.04), compared to the posteromedial approach. The anteromedial method yielded a longer semitendinosus graft, with an MD of about 17 mm (MD, 17.57; 95% CI, 7.17?27.98; p = 0.0009). However, no significant differences existed in range of motion, flexion contracture, unintentional graft harvest, infection rates, and patient-reported outcomes. Notably, the posteromedial group reported higher cosmetic satisfaction, with 92% being very satisfied, compared to the anteromedial group with 80% (p = 0.005). However, overall satisfaction levels were similar between the 2 groups (p = 0.35), with a very satisfied rate of 72% for the anteromedial group and 78% for the posteromedial group. Conclusions: The anteromedial hamstring harvest showed greater saphenous nerve injury and longer operative times compared to the posteromedial approach, along with a longer graft. However, no significant differences were observed in the range of motion, flexion contracture, graft harvest, infection, or patient outcomes. ? 2024 by The Korean Orthopaedic Association.",Scopus,10.4055/cios23396,CiOS Clinics in Orthopedic Surgery

(2024),2024,Changes in Hip Isometric Strength of Female College Soccer Players after High-Workload Training Session,"Context: The hip adductor and abductor muscles play vital roles as stabilizers in the lower-extremity. Their activation during soccer-specific actions is essential, but local muscular fatigue can hinder athletic performance and increase the risk of injury. Design: This study aimed to observe the variations in frontal plane hip strength in female college soccer players before and after a high-workload soccer-specific training session. Furthermore, the study sought to compare the relative changes in hip strength with the internal and external load measures obtained during that session. Methods: Twenty female college soccer players participated in a retrospective observational study. Isometric hip adductor and abductor strength were measured before and after a training session in the college spring season. Measurements were taken with a handheld dynamometer (MicroFET 2) while the players were supine. Global positioning system sensors (Catapult Vector S7), commonly worn by players during training sessions and competitive matches, were used to measure external and internal loads. Statistical analyses were performed using paired samples t test to assess hip adductor and abductor strength changes before and after the training session. Spearman rank was used to identify correlation coefficients between global positioning system data and isometric hip strength. Results: The findings revealed significant decreases in the strength of the right hip adduction (P = .012,-7% relative change), right abduction (P = .009,-7.6% relative change), and left abduction (P = .016,-4.9% relative change) after the training session. Furthermore, relative decreases in hip isometric adduction and abduction strength are related to the distance covered at high speeds. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight that hip isometric adduction and abduction strength tend to decrease after exposure to high workloads during soccer-specific training. ? 2024 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2023-0327,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

An alternative that has received little attention in Europe but is very popular in Asia is harvesting of the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (split graft). The aim of this article is to describe the removal technique of aÿperoneus longus split graft. The surgical approach is via an approximately 1?2?cm long skin incision posterior to the fibula just above the lateral malleolus. After splitting the subcutaneous layers and the fascia, the peroneus tendons are located: The peroneus longus tendon lies posterior and lateral to the peroneus brevis tendon. This is circumvented with aÿclamp and incised centrally along the fibers. The anterior half is reinforced with baseball stitch sutures and then severed distally.

827,SC-210,Mirza et al. (2024),2024,Donor-site morbidity following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft,"Introduction: Peroneus longus has proved to be a promising graft for ACL reconstruction due to its high tensile strength, and ease of harvesting. While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population. Matreials and methods: This was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients. Results: 20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 ñ 1.34 and 98.5 ñ 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 ñ 9.43 and 88.75 ñ 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886ñ22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 ñ 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio. Conclusion: While the use of peroneus longus tendon autografts in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction does not seem problematic on short-term subjective assessment, there is objective evidence in keeping with evertor weakness, weakness of first ray plantar flexion and possible ankle instability.

828,SC-211,Khalid et al. (2024),2024,Clinical outcomes in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft and hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. Methods: A quasi-experimental study design was utilized. This study was done at the Orthopedic Department of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, General Hospital, Islamabad, from July 2021 to July 2023. Patients were split into two groups, and they received either PLT or HT autograft. Pain, range of motion (ROM), muscle power, and return to jogging were assessed using the visual analog scale, goniometer scale, and anterior cruciate ligament-return to sports after injury scale at six weeks, three months, and six months post-surgery. Results: A total of 61 patients, out of which 26 patients received an HT (quadrupled gracilis and semitendinosus) graft and 35 received a PLT autograft. The patient?s mean age was 26.51 ñ 6.78 years. The HT group had more pain at six weeks and three months, while the PLT group had lesser pain (P < 0.05). Both groups had mild pain after six months (P = 0.337). At six and three months, there was a significant difference in ROM (P = 0.05), but no significant change in the Medical Research Council power of muscles was identified. Thirty-four patients from the PLT group could jog without discomfort before six months. Overall, every patient was satisfied with the treatment that they received. Conclusion: Patients who had ACLR with a PLT autograft had significantly better clinical and functional outcomes compared to those who received an HT autograft. ? 2024, Scientific Scholar LLC.

829,SC-212,Zuil-Escobar et al. (2024),2024,High Medial Longitudinal Arch of the Foot and Latent Trigger Points in Lower Limb Muscles,"Background: The objective was to evaluate the prevalence of latent trigger points (LTrPs) in lower limb muscles in participants with a high medial longitudinal arch (MLA) of the foot compared to controls. Methods: Participants with a navicular drop test of 4?9 mm were included in the control group; the high MLA group included navicular drop test values of ó4 mm. The presence of LTrPs was assessed by palpation techniques. The muscles evaluated were medial gastrocnemius (LTrP1), lateral gastrocnemius (LTrP2), soleus (LTrP1), peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, flexor digitorum longus, rectus femoris, vastus medialis (LTrP1 and LTrP2), and the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps (LTrP1 and LTrP2). Results: Thirty-seven participants with high MLA and thirty-seven controls were included in the study. Twenty-nine (78.4%) participants in the high MLA group had at least 1 LTrP, compared to twenty-three (62.2%) in the control group. No statistical difference (p < 0.05) was found in the total number of LTrPs between groups (4.46 ñ 3.78 vs. 3.24 ñ 3.85). There were more participants (p < 0.05) with LTrPs in the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, and vastus lateralis (LTrP1 and LTrP2) in the high MLA group than in the control group. Conclusion: Although no differences were found in the number of total LTrPs between groups, the prevalence was statistically significantly higher in the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, and vastus lateralis of the participants with high MLA of the foot. ? 2024 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/jcm13144049,Journal of Clinical Medicine

(2024),2024,"The Biomechanical, Biochemical, and Morphological Properties of 19 Human Cadaveric Lower Limb Tendons and Ligaments: An Open-Access Data Set","Background: Methodological heterogeneity hinders data comparisons across isolated studies of tendon and ligament properties, limiting clinical understanding and affecting the development and evaluation of replacement materials. Purpose: To create an open-access data set on the morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical properties of clinically important tendons and ligaments of the lower limb, using consistent methodologies, to enable direct tendon/ligament comparisons. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Nineteen distinct lower limb tendons and ligaments were retrieved from 8 fresh-frozen human cadavers (5 male, 3 female; aged 49-65 years) including Achilles, tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, fibularis (peroneus) longus, fibularis (peroneus) brevis, flexor hallucis longus, extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, flexor digitorum longus, quadriceps, patellar, semitendinosus, and gracilis tendons; anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments; and 10 mm?wide grafts from the contralateral quadriceps and patellar tendons. Outcomes included morphology (tissue length, ultrasound-quantified cross-sectional area [CSA<inf>US</inf>], and major and minor axes), biomechanics (failure load, ultimate tensile strength [UTS], failure strain, and elastic modulus), and biochemistry (sulfated glycosaminoglycan [sGAG] and hydroxyproline contents). Tissue differences were analyzed using mixed-model regression. Results: There was a range of similarities and differences between tendons and ligaments across outcomes. A key finding relating to potential graft tissue suitability was the comparable failure loads, UTS, CSA<inf>US</inf>, sGAG, and hydroxyproline present between hamstring tendons (a standard graft source) and 5 tendons not typically used for grafting: fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus tendons. Conclusion: This study of lower limb tendons and ligaments has enabled direct comparison of morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical human tissue properties?key factors in the selection of suitable graft tissues. This analysis has identified 6 potential new donor tissues with properties comparable to currently used grafts. Clinical Relevance: This extensive data set reduces the need to utilize data from incompatible sources, which may aid surgical decisions (eg, evidence to expand the range of tendons considered suitable for use as grafts) and may provide congruent design inputs for new biomaterials and computational models. The complete data set has been provided to facilitate further investigations, with the capacity to expand the resource to include additional outcomes and tissues. ? 2024 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465241260054,American Journal of Sports Medicine

(2024),2024,"Peroneus Longus Tendon Autografts have Better Graft Diameter, Less Morbidity, and Enhanced Muscle Recuperation than Hamstring Tendon in ACL Reconstruction","Background: Recently the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) gained popularity in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and has been utilized with satisfactory outcomes. However, there are concerns regarding donor site morbidity. This study aims to compare the functional outcome of ACL reconstruction using hamstring (HT) and PLT autografts and evaluate the donor site morbidity. Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (HT and PLT). Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Knee functional outcome was evaluated with IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores preoperatively, and postoperatively after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements, subjective evaluation of sensory disturbances, and ankle scoring with AOFAS and FADI scores. Results: At 1-year follow-up, the PLT group showed comparable IKDC (p = 0.925) and Tegner-Lysholm (p = 0.600) scores with those of the HT group. The mean graft diameter in the PLT group (7.93 ñ 0.52ÿmm) was larger compared with the HT group (7.43 ñ 0.50ÿmm) (p < 0.001). The incidence of thigh atrophy (HT-16.7%, PLT-10%) and sensory disturbances (HT-73.3%, PLT-10%) was greater in the HT group. There was no significant ankle donor site morbidity in the PLT group (AOFAS-98.67 ñ 3.45, FADI-99.23 ñ 1.69). Conclusion: ACL reconstruction with PLT had comparable functional outcome with that of HT at 1 year. However, PLT demonstrated larger graft diameter, less donor site morbidity, and enhanced muscle recovery without significantly affecting the ankle function. PLT can be safely used as an acceptable alternative graft choice harvested from outside the knee for ACL reconstruction. ?

(2024),2024,Comparative effectiveness of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autografts versus hamstring tendon (HT) autografts in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a comprehensive systematic review and meta analysis,"The hamstring tendon (HT) autograft is currently the most widely utilised autograft option for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, recent studies endorse the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft as a viable alternative. To evaluate this, we systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy of PLT against HT autografts. Our search encompassed Cochrane, Embase, OVID, PubMed, and Scopus databases for RCTs comparing outcomes of PLT and HT autografts in ACL reconstruction. Primary outcomes included Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)ÿscores, while secondary outcomes involved American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS)ÿscores, graft diameters and donor-site complications. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) and heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics. 683 patients from 6 RCTs were included, with 338 (49.5%) patients treated with PLT autografts. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 30ÿmonths. Despite lower preoperative Lysholm scores in the PLT group, no significant differences were observed at 6 and 12ÿmonths. Although preoperative and 6-month IKDC scores were lower in the PLT group, no significant differences were found at 12 and 24ÿmonths. AOFAS scores showed no significant preoperative difference, but slightly lower scores were noted in the PLT group at 12 or 24ÿmonths. There was no significant difference in graft diameter, while donor-site complications were fewer in the PLT group. In summary, the PLT autograft is a promising and non-inferior alternative to the HT autograft, demonstrating equivalent outcomes in patient-reported knee and ankle metrics, comparable graft diameters and fewer donor-site complications. ?

833,SC-216,Kim et al. (2024),2024,Soleus arthrogenic muscle inhibition following acute lateral ankle sprain correlates with symptoms and ankle disability but not with postural control,"Background: Acute lateral ankle sprains (ALAS) are associated with long-term impairments and instability tied to altered neural excitability. Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) has been observed in this population; however, relationships with injury-related impairments are unclear, potentially due to the resting, prone position in which AMI is typically measured. Assessing AMI during bipedal stance may provide a better understanding of this relationship. Methods: AMI was assessed in 38 young adults (19 ALAS within 72 h of injury: 10 males, 21.4 ñ 2.7 years; 19 healthy controls: 10 males, 21.9 ñ 2.2 years; mean ñ SD) using the Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) during bipedal stance. Electrical stimulation was administered to identify the maximal H-reflex (H<inf>max</inf>) and maximal motor response (M<inf>max</inf>) from the soleus, fibularis longus, and tibialis anterior muscles. The primary outcome measure was the H<inf>max</inf>/M<inf>max</inf> ratio. Secondary outcomes included acute symptoms (pain and swelling), postural control during bipedal stance, and self-reported function. Results: No significant group-by-limb interactions were observed for any muscle. However, a significant group main effect was observed in the soleus muscle (F<inf>(1,35)</inf> = 6.82, p = 0.013), indicating significantly lower H<inf>max</inf>/M<inf>max</inf> ratios following ALAS (0.38 ñ 0.20) compared to healthy controls (0.53 ñ 0.16). Furthermore, lower H<inf>max</inf>/M<inf>max</inf> ratios in the soleus significantly correlated with acute symptoms and self-reported function but not with postural control. Conclusion: This study supports previous evidence of AMI in patients with ALAS, providing insight into neurophysiologic impacts of musculoskeletal injury. Our results suggest that assessing AMI in a standing position following acute injury may provide valuable insight into how AMI develops and guide potential therapeutic options to curb and offset the formation of joint instability. ? 2024",Scopus,10.1016/j.jshs.2024.02.005,Journal of Sport and Health Science
834,SC-217,Ge et al. (2024),2024,International research trends and hotspots in posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Nowadays, posterior cruciate ligament injury caused by a sports injury or vehicle injury is more common than people think. Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the main treatment methods, but there are still a lot of controversies about the surgical method and ligament selection of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively analyze the global application trend of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and identify promising research hotspots of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction based on bibliometrics and visual analysis. METHODS: Publications (articles and reviews) related to posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction from 2000 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS). The country, institution, publication year, author, journal, average citations per item, H index, title, keywords of publication, and the top 25 cited articles were extracted and analyzed in detail. The VOSviewer/citespace/Pajek software was used to analyze the co-occurrence result of keywords to predict the hotspots of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 664 articles were included. (1) In the past 22 years, the number of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction articles has shown an increasing trend in general. The top 3 countries (the USA, China, and South Korea) accounted for 65.51% of all articles published. The USA has the largest number of publications. The University of Pittsburgh is the largest contributor. Knee Surgery Sports Traumatol Arthrosc and American Journal of Sports Medicine are the most influential journals. Laprade, Robert F. is the professor who has published the most articles in the field of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and Fanelli, GC is the professor who has the highest total chain strength in the field of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. (2) The research direction can be divided into the following five clusters: ?posterior cruciate ligament anatomical and biomechanical studies?, ?posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction prognosis, outcome, and complications?, ?posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgical method and tendon selection?, ?surgical technique?, and ?posterior cruciate ligament tear combined with multiple ligament injury?. (3) It is concluded that in terms of the trend of previous years, an increasing number of articles related to posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction will be published in the future. The USA is a world leader in the field of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. China and South Korea presented great potential in this area. Anatomical and biomechanical research of posterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction methods and the selection of tendons may be the future hotspots in the field of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. ? 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

(2024),2024,"Comparison of hamstring tendon graft, ligament advanced reinforcement system, and mixed ligament in reconstruction of posterior cruciate ligament; ?????????????????????","Objective To compare hamstring tendon graft (HTG), ligament advanced reinforcement system (LARS), and mixed HTG & LARS ligament in reconstruction of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Methods A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the 59 patients with PCL rupture who had been admitted to Department of Orthopedics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University for arthroscopic PCL reconstruction between January 2018 and August 2021. The patients were divided into 3 groups: in the HTG group of 21 cases [14 males and 7 females aged (37.8ñ12.6) years], PCL was reconstructed by HTG; in the LARS group of 20 cases [12 males and 8 females aged (34.3ñ9.1) years], PCL was reconstructed by LARS; in the mixed group of 18 cases [13 males and 5 females aged (33.2ñ8.3) years], PCL was reconstructed by the mixed HTG & LARS ligament. The 3 groups were compared in terms of Lysholm knee score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and laxity disparity between bilateral knees at 1 and 2 years after surgery. Results There was no statistically significant difference in the preoperative general data between the 3 groups, indicating comparability (P>0.05). One year after surgery, the mixed group had a significantly higher IKDC score [(90.0ñ6.5) points] than the HTG group [(78.1ñ5.7) points] and the LARS group [(84.1ñ7.3) points], and a significantly higher Lysholm score [(88.9ñ5.5) points] and a significantly smaller laxity disparity between bilateral knees [(2.8ñ1.7) mm] than the HTG group [(81.8ñ4.6) points, (4.7ñ2.4) mm] (P<0.05). Two years after surgery, the mixed group had a Lysholm score of (93.0ñ4.5) points, a IKDC score of (92.5ñ5.7) points, and a laxity disparity between bilateral knees of (2.3ñ1.8) mm, all significantly better than those in the HTG group [(88.5ñ5.5) points, (82.7ñ5.7) points, and (4.2ñ2.5) mm] and in the LARS group [(89.0ñ5.2) points, (86.5ñ7.3) points, and (3.8ñ2.2) mm] (P<0.05). In all the 3 groups, the knee function scores and laxity disparities between bilateral knees at 1 and 2 years after surgery were significantly improved compared with the preoperative values (P<0.05). Conclusions Satisfactory clinical outcomes can be obtained after arthroscopic PCL reconstruction using HTG, LARS or the mixed HTG & LARS ligament. However, the mixed ligament as a graft can achieve better clinical efficacy than the other two grafts. ? 2024 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

836,SC-219,Saxena et al. (2024),2024,Short-term functional outcome of Anterior cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with tibial attachment preserving Hamstring graft with femoral side fixation only,"Background: Free Hamstring, Bone patellar tendon-bone, Peroneus Longus, and quadriceps tendon grafts are widely being used for Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with a satisfactory outcome. Free grafts are avascular and theirs tibial side fixation insufficiency is a potential cause of failure in ACL reconstruction. Tibial attachment preserving hamstring graft preserves the vascularity and mechanical strength on the tibial side, and could be a viable option in an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, The authors describe the early outcome of the surgical technique of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with tibial attachment sparing hamstring graft without implant on the tibial side. Material and methods: The hamstring insertion preserving five stranded graft was used for ACL reconstruction with adjustable endobutton for femoral side fixation and no implant for tibial side fixation. Thirty-six patients with one-year follow-ups were included in the study. Results: The mean length of the prepared graft attached to the tibia was 95.5 ñ 4 mm, and the mean width was 8.6 ñ 0.7 mm and 8.2 ñ 0.6 mm on the tibial and femoral side respectively. None had a failure of graft till the final follow-up. The preoperative International knee documentation committee score (IKDC) mean score improved from 47.3 ñ 8.9 to 87.3 ñ 6.7 at one-year follow-up. The preoperative Lysholm score (LS) improved from 58.1 ñ 12.8 to 90.4 ñ 4.9 at one-year follow-up. Conclusion: Attachment-sparing hamstring graft with a femoral side-only implant is a simple, cost-effective technique that provides a satisfactory outcome. ? 2023 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.jorep.2023.100259,Journal of Orthopaedic Reports
837,SC-220,Lee et al. (2024),2024,Balance Training With Stroboscopic Glasses and Neuromechanics in Patients With Chronic Ankle Instability During a Single-Legged Drop Landing,"Context: Therapeutic interventions for individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) are recommended to improve muscle strength, postural control, and range of motion. However, their effects on neuromechanics during a drop landing remain unclear. In addition, even though therapeutic interventions with stroboscopic glasses appear to effectively improve postural control, how they affect landing neuromechanics remains unclear. Objective: To identify the effect of balance training with stroboscopic glasses on neuromechanics during a single-legged drop landing in patients with CAI. Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 50 participants with CAI were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: strobe (n = 25; age = 22 ñ 3 years, height = 174.7 ñ 8.2 cm, mass = 71.8 ñ 12.2 kg) or control (n = 25; age = 21 ñ 2 years, height = 173.1 ñ 8.3 cm, mass = 71.1 ñ 13.5 kg). Intervention(s): The 4-week rehabilitation (3 sessions per week) included hop-based tasks and single-legged stance. The strobe group wore stroboscopic glasses during the training, whereas the control group did not. Main Outcome Measure(s): Ankle-, knee-, and hip-joint kinematics and 4 lower extremity muscle activations 150 milliseconds before and after initial contact during a single-legged drop landing in the 2 groups. Results: The strobe group showed greater eversion (from 150 milliseconds before to 30 milliseconds after initial contact) and dorsiflexion (from 30 to 96 milliseconds after initial contact) angles and peroneal longus (from 35 milliseconds before to 5 milliseconds after initial contact) and tibialis anterior (from 0 to 120 milliseconds after initial contact) activation in the posttest than the pretest. Conclusions: Patients with CAI who underwent a 4-week rehabilitation with stroboscopic glasses demonstrated changes in neuromechanics, including increased ankle-dorsiflexion and -eversion angles and tibialis anterior and peroneus longus activation, during a single-legged drop landing. This finding suggests that use of stroboscopic glasses during rehabilitation could help patients with CAI develop safe landing mechanics. ? by the National Athletic Trainers?

838,SC-221,Gaviraghi et al. (2024),2024,Females Present Different Single-Leg Squat Kinematics and Muscle Activation Strategies than Males Even after Hip Abductor Fatigue,"Background: Despite the potential connection between hip and knee muscle control, there is limited research on the effects of hip abductor fatigue on the hip and knee neuromuscular responses in both males and females. This study aimed to investigate the influence of sex on the hip and knee frontal plane kinematics and the EMG responses of the hip abductors and knee extensor muscles during the single-leg squat before and after hip abductor fatigue. Methods: A total of 30 participants (males, n = 15; females, n = 15) performed single-leg squats before and immediately after a hip abductor fatigue protocol (10ø hip abduction position while bearing a 20% load of their estimated 1RM until exhaustion). The frontal plane kinematics (hip adduction and knee frontal plane projection angle) and EMG parameters (amplitude and median frequency) of the gluteus medius (GMed), tensor fascia latae (TFL), vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) were measured during the single-leg squat. Results: We did not find any effects of hip abductor fatigue or interaction between fatigue and sex on the evaluated parameters (p > 0.05). However, compared to males, females had greater values for the hip and knee frontal plane kinematics (p = 0.030), GMed EMG amplitude (+10.2%, p = 0.012) and median frequency (+10.3%; p = 0.042) and lower VL median frequency (?9.80%; p = 0.007). Conclusions: These findings establish sex-related differences in the kinematics and hip and knee EMG parameters during the single-leg squat, which were not influenced by the hip abductor fatigue protocol. ? 2024 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/biomechanics4020017,Biomechanics (Switzerland)
839,SC-222,Kim et al. (2024),2024,Effects of Functional Fatigue Protocol and Visual Information on Postural Control in Patients with Chronic Ankle Instability,"Chronic ankle instability (CAI) patients often exhibit postural control deficits and rely on visual information to maintain static balance to compensate for decreased proprioception. Fatigue impairs neuromuscular control, in addition to postural control, in CAI patients. However, whether functional fatiguing exercises alter postural control and sensory organization strategies during single-leg balance tests in CAI patients remains unclear. This study involved a controlled trial on 28 CAI patients in a laboratory setting. Each participant performed a single-leg balance test with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) before and after a functional fatigue protocol. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA evaluated fatigue (pre- vs. post-fatigue) ? vision (EO vs. EC) interactions for outcome variables. Additionally, paired-sample t-tests examined differences between two conditions (pre- vs. post-fatigue) for time-to-boundary (TTB) minima (%modulation). We found significant interactions between fatigue and vision conditions in ML and AP TTBmeans and AP TTBsds. %Modulations were significantly decreased after fatigue in AP TTBmean, ML TTBsd, and AP TTBsd. In conclusion, static postural control ability decreased after the functional fatigue protocol with EO, but was unchanged with EC. This suggests that decreased balance ability is more pronounced with EO under fatigue due to less visual dependence. This may increase ankle sprain incidence under fatigue. ? 2024 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/app14114445,Applied Sciences (Switzerland)
840,SC-223,Blanke et al. (2024),2024,An anteromedial stabilization procedure has the most protective effect on the anterior cruciate ligament in tibial external rotation. A human knee model study,"Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains associated with the risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces. Methods: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. Results: The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation. Conclusion: This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces. ?

Methods: Three databases were searched on 29 Augustÿ2023. The authors adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and R-AMSTAR (Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Review) guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data on demographics, anthropometric characteristics, imaging techniques, tendon CSA, correlation coefficients, sensitivities, specificities, regression modelsÿand cutoffs for predicting intraoperative graft diameters above 8 mm were recorded. Results: Forty-six studies comprising 4140 patients were included. Twelve of 19 (63.2%) studies reporting on ST + GT CSA found a moderate to very high correlation with intraoperative graft diameter. Five of 10 (50%) and one of seven (14.3%) studies reporting on ST CSA and GT CSA, respectively, found a moderate to high correlation with intraoperative graft diameter. Cutoffs of ST + GT CSA for predicting graft diameters above 8 mm ranged from 15.8 to 31.2 mm2. Nine of 35 (25.7%) studies that reported on height found a moderate to very high correlation with graft diameter. Seven of 33 (21.2%) studies reporting on weight found a moderate correlation with graft diameter. Conclusion: Of the MRI parameters assessed, ST + GT CSA was the most reliable predictor of graft diameter. However, cutoffs, sensitivities, and specificities for predicting diameters above 8 mm were highly variable. Anthropometric characteristics in general were less predictive of graft diameter than MRI parameters. This information can be used by clinicians to predict patients at risk for ACLR failure due to insufficient graft size. Level of Evidence: Level IV. ? 2024 The Authors.

842,SC-225,Zhang et al. (2024),2024,The Efficacy of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon and its Impact on Ankle Joint Function,"Objective: Peroneus Longus Tendon (PLT), a viable anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, shares similar biomechanics, making it suitable for reconstruction. Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system?Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. Results: One year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p > 0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p > 0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p < 0.05). Conclusion: ACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles. ? 2024 The Authors.

843,SC-226,Zou et al. (2024),2024,The value of fibrinogen combined with D-dimer and neonatal weight in predicting postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore whether fibrinogen (Fib) can be used as a predictor of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in parturients with vaginal delivery, and the value of combining Fib with other indexes to predict postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery. Methods: A total of 207 parturients who delivered via vagina were divided into PPH group (n=102) and non-PPH group (n=105). The PPH group was further divided into mild PPH group and severe PPH group. The differences of Fib, platelet (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), D-dimer (D-D), hemoglobin (HGB) and neonatal weight (Nw) between the two groups were compared to explore the significance of these indexes in predicting PPH. Results: Fib, PLT and PDW in PPH group were significantly lower than those in non-PPH group, while D-D and Nw in PPH group were significantly higher than those in non-PPH group. In the binary logistic regression model, we found that Fib, D-D and Nw were independently related to PPH. The risk of PPH increased by 9.87 times for every 1 g/L decrease in Fib. The cut-off value of Fib is 4.395 (sensitivity 0.705, specificity 0.922). The AUC value of PPH predicted by Fib combined with D-D and Nw was significantly higher than that of PPH predicted by Fib (p<0.05, 95 % CI 0.00313-0.0587). Conclusions: Fib, D-D and Nw have good predictive value for PPH of vaginal delivery, among which Fib is the best. The combination of three indexes of Fib, D-D and Nw can predict PPH more systematically and comprehensively, and provide a basis for clinical prevention and treatment of PPH. ? 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Scopus,10.1515/jpm-2023-0351,Journal of Perinatal Medicine
844,SC-227,Liu et al. (2024),2024,Blood flow restriction training improves the efficacy of routine intervention in patients with chronic ankle instability,"As a new means of rehabilitation, blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is widely used in the field of musculoskeletal rehabilitation. To observe whether BFRT can improve the efficacy of routine rehabilitation intervention in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Twenty-three patients with CAI were randomly divided into a routine rehabilitation group (RR Group) and a routine rehabilitation ?+ ?blood flow restriction training group (RR ?+ ?BFRT Group) according to the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) score. The RR Group was treated with routine rehabilitation means for intervention, and the RR ?+ ?BFRT Group was treated with a tourniquet to restrict lower limb blood flow for rehabilitation training based on routine training. Before and after the intervention, the CAIT score on the affected side, standing time on one leg with eyes closed, comprehensive scores of the Y-balance test, and surface electromyography data of tibialis anterior (TA) and peroneus longus (PL) were collected to evaluate the recovery of the subjects. Patients were followed up 1 year after the intervention. After 4 weeks of intervention, the RR ?+ ?BFRT Group CAIT score was significantly higher than the RR Group (19.33 VS 16.73, p ?< ?0.05), the time of standing on one leg with eyes closed and the comprehensive score of Y-balance were improved, but there was no statistical difference between groups (p ?> ?0.05). RR ?+ ?BFRT Group increased the muscle activation of the TA with maximum exertion of the ankle dorsal extensor (p ?< ?0.05) and had no significant change in the muscle activation of the PL with maximum exertion of the ankle valgus (p ?> ?0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of resprains within 1 year between the groups (36.36% VS 16.67%, p ?> ?0.05). The incidence of ankle pain in the RR ?+ ?BFRT Group was lower than that in the RR Group (63.64% VS 9.09%, p ?< ?0.01). Therefore, four-weeks BFRT improves the effect of the routine intervention, and BFRT-related interventions are recommended for CAI patients with severe ankle muscle mass impairment or severe pain. ? 2024 Chengdu Sport University",Scopus,10.1016/j.smhs.2023.11.001,Sports Medicine and Health Science
845,SC-228,Selcuk et al. (2024),2024,Peroneus longus tendon autograft versus allograft in revision ACLR: A retrospective comparison,"Purpose: The use of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autografts in primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has increased recently, but there is a lack of research on its use in revision ACLR. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and complications between revision ACLR using allografts and PLT autografts. Materials and methods: Fifty-nine patients who underwent arthroscopic revision of ACLR with complete clinical follow-ups between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Allograft was used in 44 of these patients, and PLT autograft was used in 15 of them. Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, Lachman, and anterior drawer tests were performed after a mean follow-up of 60 months (range: 19?116). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to evaluate the donor ankle functions. Clinical outcomes and complications were compared between groups. Results: Both groups showed significantly improved functional outcomes compared to their preoperative assessments. However, both groups had similar clinical results at the final follow-up, including Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity scale, knee range of motion, return to sports, time to return to daily activities, and rate of re-rupture. No major complications were seen in any of the patients. The AOFAS score was 99.13 ñ 2.64 in the PLT autograft group without loss of ankle muscle strength, deformity, instability, and permanent iatrogenic neurovascular injuries. The cumulative cost of the allograft group was significantly higher than the PLT autograft group. Conclusions: The PLT autograft might be an alternative autograft option to allografts due to similar clinical outcomes, low donor site morbidity, and reduced cost in ACLR revisions, especially if the primary ACLR was performed using grafts harvested around the knee.

846,SC-229,Sonsukong et al. (2024),2024,Ankle Biomechanics During Multidirectional Landings in Athletes With Chronic Ankle Instability,"Background: Assessing and understanding the control of the ankle during multidirectional jump landings in athletes with chronic ankle instability (CAI) would help health professionals develop interventions to reduce the risk of recurrent injuries. The aim of this study was to investigate the angle, angular velocity, and movements of the ankle joint, and the muscle activity of peroneus longus (PL), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius (GAS) muscles during multidirectional landings in athletes with CAI. Methods: Nineteen athletes with CAI (ó25 Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool?Thai Score) participated. A Vicon Nexus motion analysis system synchronously collected data with an AMTI force plate and surface electromyography (EMG) to capture kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity, respectively. Participants were asked to perform single-leg jump-landing tests in forward (0ø), 30ø diagonal, 60ø diagonal, and lateral (90ø) directions. Ankle joint kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity of PL, TA, and GAS were analyzed. Repeated measure ANOVA (analysis of variance) and Friedman tests were used to analyze the main effects of the jump-landing direction. Results: Athletes with CAI exhibited significant differences in ankle angles, angular velocities, ankle movements, and average muscle activity of GAS between directions. Greatest average EMG of GAS muscle was observed during landing in the lateral direction compared with the forward and 30ø diagonal directions. Conclusion: Lateral and diagonal direction movements showed the greatest risks associated with recurrent ankle sprains. Impairments of neuromuscular control in both pre-landing and landing phases were observed in athletes with CAI when considered alongside previously published data.

(2024),2024,Comparison of lateral veneer fixation versus tunnel fixation for reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament in the treatment of recurrent patellar dislocation in adolescents; ????????????????????????????????????,"Objective To compare the lateral veneer fixation versus the tunnel fixation for reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) in the treatment of recurrent patellar dislocation in adolescents. Methods A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the data of 50 adolescent patients with recurrent patellar dislocation who had been treated at Department of Pediatric Orthopedics, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from January 2020 to January 2023. There were 12 males and 38 females with an age of (15.0ñ0.9) years, and 23 cases on the left and 27 cases on the right. The number of preoperative dislocations was (2.5ñ0.9) times. According to the surgical methods, the patients were divided into 2 groups: a veneer group of 25 cases whose MPFL was reconstructed by the patellar lateral veneer fixation, and a tunnel group of 25 cases whose MPFL was reconstructed by the patellar tunnel fixation. The 2 groups were compared in terms of Kujala score, Lysholm score, lateral patellofemoral angle (LPFA), congruence angle (CA), patellar tilt angle (PTA), and lateral patellar displacement (LPT) at the last follow-up. Results As the differences in the preoperative general data between the groups were insignificant, the 2 groups were comparable (P>0.05). The 50 patients were followed up for (24.1ñ5.1) months after surgery. There were no complications like patellar fracture or limitation of joint flexion-extension in either group after surgery, and neither group experienced any further patellar dislocation at the last follow-up. The Kujala score, Lysholm score, LPFA, CA, PTA and LPT at the last follow-up were (87.8ñ4.3) points, (88.3ñ4.7) points, 9.5øñ1.1ø, 10.8øñ1.4ø, 9.6øñ1.0ø, and 9.2ñ1.3 mm in the veneer group, and (86.0ñ4.4) points, (87.7ñ4.2) points, 9.5øñ1.1ø, 11.0øñ1.6ø, 9.0øñ1.8ø, and (9.2ñ1.3) mm in the tunnel group, respectively, showing no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). However, there were significant improvements within each group in the comparisons of the above indexes between pre-surgery and the last follow-up (P<0.05). Conclusion In the treatment of recurrent patellar dislocation in adolescents, both lateral veneer fixation and tunnel fixation to reconstruct the MPFL can improve the alignment of the patellofemoral joint in adolescents, contributing to the improvement of knee joint function and patellar stability. ? 2024 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

848,SC-231,Conyer et al. (2024),2024,Association of Posterior Tibial Slope With Outcomes After Multiligamentous Knee Reconstruction for Knee Dislocation Grades 2 to 4,"Background: Patients with isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction have demonstrated an increased risk of ACL graft failure and lower patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores when increased posterior tibial slope (PTS) is present. However, there is a paucity of literature evaluating the effect of PTS on outcomes after combined bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstruction. Purpose: To determine whether differences exist for graft failure rates or PRO scores based on PTS after combined bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstruction. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All patients who underwent combined ACL and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction between 2000 and 2020 at our institution were identified. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, knee dislocation grade 5 injuries, concomitant osteotomy procedures, and <2 years of clinical follow-up. Demographic and outcomes data were collected from our prospectively gathered multiligamentous knee injury database. Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were analyzed in relation to PTS. Outcomes were compared for patients with a PTS above and below the mean for the total cohort, PTS >12ø versus <12ø, positive versus negative Lachman test at follow-up, and positive versus negative posterior drawer test at follow-up. Results: A total of 98 knees in 98 patients were included in the study, with a mean clinical follow-up of 5.1 years (median, 4.6 years; range, 2-16 years). The mean PTS was 8.7ø (range, 0.4ø-16.9ø). Linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between PTS and IKDC or Lysholm scores. Patients with a PTS above the mean of 8.7ø trended toward lower IKDC (P =.08) and Lysholm (P =.06) scores. Four patients experienced ACL graft failure and 5 patients experienced PCL graft failure. There were no differences in graft failure rates or PRO scores for patients with a PTS >12ø. Patients with a positive Lachman test trended toward higher PTS (9.6ø vs 8.5ø, P =.15). Conclusion: In this series of bicruciate multiligamentous knee reconstructions at midterm follow-up, no differences in graft failures, complications, reoperations, revisions, or PRO scores based on PTS were identified. Patients with a positive Lachman test were found to have a slightly higher PTS, although this did not reach statistical significance. ?

849,SC-232,Locosselli et al. (2024),2024,Stress-tolerant trees for resilient cities: Tree-ring analysis reveals species suitable for a future climate,"Cities are vulnerable to droughts and heatwaves due to the decline in permeable green spaces and the emergence of heat islands. To tackle these environmental challenges, many cities adopted ambitious tree-planting initiatives. However, tree tolerance to climate extremes is overlooked even though physiological and growth limitations jeopardize ecosystem services provision. We assessed the responses of Tipuana tipu to the 2013/2014 summer drought in S?o Paulo, Brazil. We sampled trees in a park and streets and assessed how tree-ring ë13C and growth responses to drought differ. The Regression Tree shows that microhabitats exert the strongest control on tree-ring ë13C seconded by drought. ë13C is on average 1.0? higher in streets where growth rate is 60% higher than in the park. Similarly, ë13C increased by up to 0.9? during the drought when growth increased by up to 45% in both sites. This positive association between ë13C and growth rate (R2 = 0.78) indicates that growth is limited by assimilation rate. Assimilation is up to 15% higher in streets and increased by up to 10% during the drought because of higher incident sunlight and air temperature. Thus, T. tipu is a drought-tolerant species with potential to contribute to (sub)tropical cities, thriving in a warming climate. ? 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.uclim.2024.101964,Urban Climate

A scoping review of randomised controlled trials,"Purpose: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation has been proposed to improve the results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The present study aims to quantify the available evidence to support the use of PRP as biological augmentation in ACLR surgery. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on the PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Scienceÿand Embase databases on 10 Marchÿ2023. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), written in English, addressing PRP augmentation in ACLR surgery, with no time limitation. A scoping review was performed to map the body of literature by examining the evidence related to specific aspects of patients' treatment and evaluation. Risk of bias evaluation was performed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials Version 2 (RoB 2), while the quality assessment was performed with the use of the Coleman Score. Results: Out of 983 articles retrieved, 23 RCTs on 943 knees were included in this scoping review. PRP was administered in a liquid form in nineÿstudies and clotted in 11 studies, while in three studies both liquid and clotted PRP were used. Hamstring auto/allografts were used in 14 studies, patellar tendon auto/allografts were used in eight studiesÿand one study described ACLR with peroneus longus allografts. The map of the evidence documented high heterogeneity also in terms of surgical technique, objective and subjective outcome measuresÿand radiological assessment, as well as follow-up times ranging from 1 day to 2 years, with virtually no overlapping data among studies neither in terms of treatments nor evaluations. Risk of bias evaluation showed an overall low quality of the included studies. Conclusions: The available literature addressing PRP augmentation in ACLR is largely scattered. PRP was produced and applied following different procedures, and high variability was detected across the included studies for every aspect of ACLR surgery and evaluation. Currently, a meaningful comparison of the available studies is not possible as the quantification of the literature results is biased by their heterogeneity. Future studies should provide more standardisation to investigate the benefits of biological augmentation in ACL surgery and confirm the promising yet weak evidence of PRP potential as well as the most suitable application modality, before routine use in clinical practice.

(2024),2024,Donor age has no relevant role in biomechanical properties of allografts used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction: A systematic review,"Purpose: Surgeons generally consider the donor age as a factor that negatively influences the quality of allograft used in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, however, the available evidence does not clearly support this statement. The purpose of the study was to investigate if donor age influences the biomechanical properties of allografts used in ACLÿreconstruction. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted for all relevant articles using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane Collaboration Library, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. Studies including the analysis of the correlation between biomechanical properties of the allografts and donor age were selected. The role of donor age was labelled as ?none? if absent, ?higher? or ?lower? if the properties were higher or lower in older specimens with respect to younger. The correlation was defined as ?weak? or ?strong? according to each study definition. Results: No conflicting role of donor age was reported for modulus of elasticity, load to failure, strain, stiffness and displacement. The only parameters where the significant results were consistent were the tensile strength and the stress (low or moderate correlations). When considering the tested samples with a donor's age <65 years, a significant role of age was reported in only four out of 13 groups of graft tested (patellar tendon, fascia lata, anterior tibialis tendonÿand posterior tibialis tendon). Conclusion: The current literature did not allow to state that the donor age negatively influences the biomechanical properties of allografts, making it impossible to identify a clear age cut-off value to exclude them from ACL reconstruction procedures.

There are different types of grafts used, and the choice depends on several factors. Autologous grafts, from the patients themselves, are the most common option, with rapid incorporation and a lower failure rate. Allografts from donors have their role in specific cases. Synthetic grafts, used in the 1980s, have advantages such as the absence of morbidity at the donor site, but studies have shown long-term complications. Hybrid grafts, combining autologous grafts and allografts, have gained interest, allowing a larger diameter and reducing morbidity. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has received attention, with positive results, good knee function and less hypotrophy of the thigh at the donor site. Autologous quadriceps tendon graft has gained popularity, with results comparable to patellar and flexor tendon grafts, lower morbidity at the donor site and a lower rate of re-rupture. The choice of graft has evolved, with autologous flexor grafts being preferred for less active patients and patellar grafts with bone fragments for high-performance athletes. Allografts, synthetic and hybrid grafts have their role in specific circumstances. The choice must be based on scientific evidence, considering advantages and disadvantages. ACL reconstruction is a complex procedure that requires individual considerations to select the most appropriate graft. ? 2024.

853,SC-236,Seruya et al. (2024),2024,Anatomical and Technical Considerations in Fascicular Nerve Transfers for Foot Drop,"Background Foot drop is the common endpoint for a diverse set of nerve injuries, affecting over 128,000 in the United States each year. The level of injury, finite pace of regeneration, and/ exponential decay in the percentage of motor end-plates reinnervated over time may explain the limited success with natural recovery. Past nerve techniques have also been met with limited success. Methods This narrative review explores why past nerve techniques have failed to correct foot drop. Results Previously described nerve transfer techniques suffer from incompletely balancing the foot and ankle, poor donor-target nerve synergy, and/or not effectively bypassing the wide and oftentimes underappreciated zone of injury. For maximal stability, one should look to balance the foot in both dorsiflexion and eversion. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of the branching anatomy for the peroneal and tibial nerves are provided, with specific application to nerve transfer reconstruction. Conclusion Based on an understanding of why past nerve techniques have failed to correct foot drop, a set of surgical principles can be codified to optimize functional outcomes. A surgical technique should be versatile enough to address foot drop from any of the three common pathways of injury (lumbar spine, sciatic nerve, and common peroneal nerve). With increasing familiarity using this once poorly understood anatomical region, limitations with past nerve transfer techniques may be overcome. ? 2024. Thieme.

Purpose: To conduct a layer-by-layer dissection of the knee?s anteromedial side and provide a qualitative and quantitative description of the anatomy and histology of a ligament in the anteromedial region of the knee, which we have termed the anterior oblique ligament (AOL). Also, to describe the AOL relationship with what we have termed the medial cross?a ligament complex that stabilizes the medial pivot. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: A total of 35 fresh-frozen knees from transfemoral amputations that were exclusively performed for vascular reasons were dissected. Structures were identified after meticulous dissection, respecting the same protocol, measured with a digital caliper rule, and histologically studied for data. Results: The AOL was found in all dissected knees, with a mean length of 31.47 ñ 5.06 mm. This structure presented a ligament histology with densely organized collagen fibrils. The medial cross was represented by the superficial medial collateral ligament, AOL (anterior region), and posterior oblique ligament. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the presence of a ligament in the anteromedial region of the knee, termed the AOL. This structure was in the anterior part of a ligament complex?the medial cross. Clinical Relevance: Studying and revisiting the medial compartment can provide important information for understanding joint instability and promoting better results in ligament reconstructions. ?

Methods: This study used a prospective cohort study design. Online enrolment from August 2018 to January 2019 in ACL Community Indonesia recruited 148 patients who had undergone ACLR less than one month prior to injury. Knee injury occurrence after ACLR was diagnosed through a physical examination and positive MRI or arthroscopic findings. Results: During the study, 55 knee reinjuries occurred. The proportional hazards model analysis revealed that the risk of knee reinjury at 12 and 24 months for patients who returned to level I sports (hazards ratio (HR)=3.17 and HR=3.90, respectively) was significantly higher than that of the patients who did not return to sports and that the risk for those who returned to level II/III sports did not significantly increase at 12 or 24 months. Patients with concomitant meniscus injury had a significantly higher risk of knee reinjury at 12 and 24 months (HR=3.33 and HR=2.25, respectively) than those without, and the risk of knee reinjury for patients with concomitant posterior cruciate ligament injury was significantly higher at 12 months (HR=3.05) but not at 24 months. Fewer knee symptoms after ACLR were significantly associated with a lower risk of knee reinjury (HR=0.98) at 12 and 24 months. Conclusions: The return to level I sports, concomitant meniscus and posterior cruciate ligament injury, and knee symptoms after ACLR may increase the risk of knee reinjury for post-ACLR patients. ?

Previously reported methods have described end-to-end repair, transfer of the extensor hallucis longus, and allograft interposition graft. The purpose of this paper is to describe a technique for reconstruction of the anterior tibialis tendon with a transfer of the medial 2 tendons of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) to span any gaps or diseased tendon. In addition, the lateral 2 tendons of the EDL are transferred to the peroneus tertius to balance dorsiflexion and prevent overpull on the fourth and fifth toes if the EDL tendons are left in place. Using the EDL to reconstruct the anterior tibialis provides an in-phase tendon transfer resulting in symmetric dorsiflexion at the ankle. In addition, the EDL is a normal muscle with the capacity for hypertrophy, which supplements the muscle power of the injured anterior tibialis which often atrophies in the interim between injury and repair.

858,SC-241,Chauhan et al. (2024),2024,"Clinical Outcomes of Anatomic, Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction through All-inside Technique in Armed Forces Personnel","Context: Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) allows patients to resume their sports activity and delay the onset of osteoarthritis associated with loss of meniscal function. The all-inside approach for ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is to increase the graft diameter by folding several strands when sufficient graft diameter is not secured. Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and functional outcomes in patients undergoing of anatomic, all-inside ACLR procedure. Settings and Design: This was a prospective clinical study conducted in a Tertiary Care Hospital for 12 months on patients undergoing all-inside anatomic arthroscopic ACLR with hamstring autograft using BUTTONFIX ? fixation button with adjustable loop (Chetan Meditech Pvt. Ltd., Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India). Subjects and Methods: Patients were evaluated for functional status using Lysholm Knee Score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Tegner Activity Scale at 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month postsurgery. Statistical Analysis Used: All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23 (IBM 2013). Results: Forty patients were included in the study with a mean age of 29.38 ñ 5.47. There was a gradual increase in the scores at the follow-up starting from baseline with a mean difference of Lysholm knee score from 43.58 ñ 5.23 to 93.50 ñ 3.00 at the 12-month follow-up period. Similarly, the KOOS at baseline showed a mean of 44.03 ñ 5.20, which increased gradually up to 93.05 ñ 2.83 at 12 months, and the Tegner activity score at baseline was 3.55 ñ 0.6 and gradually increased to 7.28 ñ 0.85 at 12-month period. Conclusions: All-inside surgical techniques for the anatomic ACLR showed favorable clinical and functional outcomes. ? 2024 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

(2024),2024,Reconstruction of Coracoclavicular Ligaments with Semitendinosus Autograft and Temporary Kirschner Wires is a good option for Chronic Acromioclavicular Joint Instability,"Introduction: This study reports the results of surgical anatomic reconstruction of torn coracoclavicular ligaments with an autogenous semitendinosus graft and temporary Kirschner wires (K-wires) in chronic acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations. Materials and methods: Nineteen shoulders underwent surgical anatomic reconstruction of torn coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments with an autogenous semitendinosus tendon graft and temporary K-wires for Rockwood grade III, IV and V chronic AC joint dislocations. Pre-operative data included patients? demographic characteristics, injury characteristics and surgical histories. The primary outcome measures were the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating scale and visual analogue pain scoring (VAS), and the complications were noted for each patient. Results: Surgical anatomic reconstruction of torn CC ligaments was performed in 19 patients with a mean age of 41.6ñ16 years (range 21?72 years). All of the patients were satisfied and felt better after CC ligament reconstruction. The average UCLA shoulder rating scale score was good/excellent: 29.4 (range 23?34) out of 35 points. The average pre-operative VAS score was 7.7 points out of 10 and improved to 1.1 points post-operatively (p<0.05). None of the patients experienced failure during the follow-up. One patient had a mild subluxation, but the patient was satisfied with the result. Conclusions: This technique is simple, reliable, and biologic without major complications. It is also a cost-effective procedure since it can be performed with Kirschner wires and autogenous grafts. It has a major advantage of leaving no implants inside the joint, which can lead to hardware complications, and it can be performed in basic operating room settings. ? 2024, Malays. Orthop. J.

(2024),2024,Clinico-radiological outcome of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Augmentation of Dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Allograft Membrane using Peroneus Longus Autograft,"Introduction: For many sportsmen, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are unfortunate but common injuries. Several growth factors, cytokine, chemokine, and protease inhibitors functions in stimulation of paracrine reactions in fibroblast, endothelial, and stem cells thereby promoting the tissue restorative processes. Augmented with dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft reinforces the reconstructed ligament and aids in effective restoration. Materials and methods: In this case control study 15 patients undertaking ACL reconstruction with tripled peroneus augmented dHACM (G1) were prospectively monitored up for a period of 8 months along with 15 control patients (G2) without dHACM augmentation. Clinical and radiological outcomes were analysed and assessed about effect of augmenting the peroneus longus graft using dHACM. Clinical analysis included pre-operative two, four, six, and eight months post-operative Tegnor-Lysholm score, and radiological analysis included the 6th month postoperative MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements by mean signal-value at femoral insertion, midsubstance and tibial insertion of ACL graft. Results: Clinically, as a mean Lysholm score of all patients, they were revealed to be consecutively high in G1 than in Group 2 at four, six, and eight months. The signal-to-noise ratio from the MRI results showed majority having good healing in G1 group. Conclusions: Based on 6-month MRI, an effective ligamentization (SNR<75) was noticed in 53.33% of patients in the dHACM allograft enhanced group on comparison with 33% in the controls. The overall results show that the augmentation of dHACM allograft to ACL reconstruction yields in good patient outcomes at post-operative follow-up. ? 2024, Malaysian Orthopaedic Association.

861,SC-244,Sritharan et al. (2024),2024,Evaluating the quality of systematic reviews of comparative studies in autograft-based anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the AMSTAR-2 tool: A systematic umbrella review,"Purpose: There remains a lack of consensus around autograft selection in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), though there is a large body of overlapping systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Systematic reviews and their methodological quality were aimed to be further assessed, using a validated tool known as assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews (AMSTAR-2). Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL were searched from inception to 23 April 2023 for systematic reviews (with/without meta-analysis) comparing primary ACLR autografts. A final quality rating from AMSTAR-2 was provided for each study (?critically low?, ?low?, ?moderate? or ?high? quality). Correlational analyses were conducted for ratings in relation to study characteristics. Results: Two thousand five hundred and ninety-eight studies were screened, and 50 studies were ultimately included. Twenty-four studies (48%) were rated as ?critically low?, 17 (34%) as ?low?, seven (14%) as ?moderate? and two (4%) as ?high? quality. The least followed domains were reporting on sources of funding (1/50 studies), the impact of risk of bias on results of meta-analyses (11/36 studies) and publication bias (17/36 studies). There was a significant increase in the frequency of studies graded as ?moderate? compared to ?low? or ?critically low? quality over time (p = 0.020). Conclusion: The methodological quality of systematic reviews comparing autografts in ACLR is low, with many studies being rated lower due to commonly absent aspects of systematic review methodology such as investigating sources of funding and publication bias. More recent studies were generally more likely to be of higher quality. Authors are advised to consult AMSTAR-2 prior to conducting systematic reviews in ACLR.

862,SC-245,Saliba et al. (2024),2024,The Ankle Ligament Reconstruction-Return to Sport after Injury (ALR-RSI) is a valid and reliable measure to assess psychological readiness before returning to sport following peroneal tendon pathology surgery,"Purpose: The objective of this study was to validate a scale that could help surgeons evaluate patients' psychological readiness to return to sport (RTS) after peroneal tendon pathology surgery. Methods: The Ankle Ligament Reconstruction-Return to Sport after Injury (ALR-RSI) scale, which had previously been validated in ankle ligament reconstruction patients, was adapted to evaluate the psychological preparedness for RTS in athletic patients who underwent peroneal tendinopathy surgery. The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and Foot Ankle Ability Measurement (FAAM) scores were employed as patient-related outcome measurement (PROM) instruments. Results: This study included 57 patients. There was a strong correlation between ALR-RSI and both FAOS and FAAM (r = ?0.68 and 0.74, respectively). ALR-RSI was considerably higher in patients who returned to sports than in those who did not. The mean score was 72.9 ñ 19.0 in patients who returned to the same preinjury level, 48.5 ñ 24.0 in those who returned to a lower levelÿand 53.6 ñ 31.1 in patients who changed their athletic activity (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, ALR-RSI showed at least a similar discrimination ability when compared to FAOS and FAAM. The test?retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.95. The Cronbach's à statistic used to measure the internal consistency was high (0.95). A Youden index of 0.65 was observed for a cut-off score of 68 points. Conclusion: ALR-RSI is a valid instrument for assessing psychological readiness to RTS in an athletic population following peroneal tendon surgery. When compared to the most commonly used PROMs, it was strongly correlated and demonstrated at least similar discrimination capacity. This could assist surgeons in identifying athletes who will have poor postoperative results and advising them on their capability to RTS. Level of Evidence: Level III. ? 2024 The Authors.

(2024),2024,The impact of whole-body vibration training and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation on biomechanical characteristics of lower extremity during cutting movement in individuals with functional ankle instability: A parallel-group study,"Background: We compared the effects of whole-body vibration training and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation on the biomechanical characteristics of the lower limbs in functional ankle instability patients during cutting movement to ascertain the superior rehabilitation method. Methods: Twenty-two male College students with unilateral functional ankle instability volunteered for this study and were randomly divided into whole-body vibration training group and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation group. Kinematics data and ground reaction forces were collected using infrared motion capture system and 3-D force plates synchronously during cutting. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was performed to analyze the data. Findings: Both training methods reduced the maximum hip abduction angle (p = 0.010, effect size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 0.69; whole-body vibration training = 0.20), maximum knee flexion angle (p = 0.008, effect size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 0.39, whole-body vibration training = 1.26) and angular velocity (p = 0.014, effect size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 0.62, whole-body vibration training = 0.55), maximum ankle inversion angular velocity (p = 0.020, effect size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 0.52, whole-body vibration training = 0.81), and knee flexion angle at the time of maximum vertical ground reaction forces (p = 0.018, effect size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = 0.27, whole-body vibration training = 0.76), and increased the maximum ankle dorsiflexion moment (p = 0.049, effect size: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation = ?0.52, whole-body vibration training = ?0.22). Whole-body vibration training reduced the maximum ground reaction forces value in the mediolateral directions (p = 0.010, effect size = 0.82) during cutting movement. Interpretation: These findings suggested that the two types of training might increase neuromuscular conduction function around the ankle. After these two types of training, functional ankle instability patients showed a similar risk of injury to the lateral ankle ligaments during cutting. ? 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2024.106208,Clinical Biomechanics
864,SC-247,Wu et al. (2024),2024,Clinical and Radiological Outcomes After Combined ACL and MPFL Reconstruction Versus Isolated ACL Reconstruction for ACL Injury With Patellar Instability,"Background: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury accompanied by patellar instability (PI) is a topic that has gained orthopaedic surgeons? attention recently. Untreated PI is reportedly associated with worse clinical outcomes after isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR) in patients after an ACL injury with PI. Nevertheless, the appropriate surgical approach and its long-term therapeutic effects in these patients remain unclear. Purpose: (1) To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes between isolated ACLR (iACLR) and combined ACLR and medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (cAMR) in patients after an ACL injury with PI and (2) to explore the correlations between these 2 procedures and clinical and radiological outcomes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 106 patients diagnosed with an ACL injury accompanied by PI between January 2016 and April 2021 were analyzed in this study. There were 34 patients excluded because of missing postoperative radiological data. Among the remaining 72 patients, 34 patients underwent iACLR, while 38 patients underwent cAMR. Demographic characteristics, intraoperative findings, and patient-reported outcomes (Lysholm score, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee score, and Tegner activity score) were prospectively collected. Patellar alignment parameters and worsening patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) features (evaluated with the modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score) were analyzed longitudinally on magnetic resonance imaging. The Kujala score was used to evaluate the functional recovery of the patellofemoral joint, and redislocations of the patella were prospectively recorded. Finally, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore the correlations between these 2 procedures and clinical (not achieving the minimal detectable change [MDC] for the Lysholm score) and radiological (worsening PFOA features) outcomes. Results: The mean follow-up duration was 28.9 ñ 6.2 and 27.1 ñ 6.8 months for the iACLR and cAMR groups, respectively (P =.231). Significantly higher Lysholm scores (88.3 ñ 9.9 vs 82.1 ñ 11.1, respectively; P =.016) and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee scores (83.6 ñ 11.9 vs 78.3 ñ 10.2, respectively; P =.046) were detected in the cAMR group compared with the iACLR group postoperatively. The rates of return to preinjury sports were 20.6% and 44.7% in the iACLR and cAMR groups, respectively (difference, 24.1% [95% CI, 3.3%-45.0%]; P =.030). Moreover, the rates of worsening PFOA features were 44.1% and 18.4% in the iACLR and cAMR groups, respectively (difference, 25.7% [95% CI, 4.9%-46.4%]; P =.018). In addition, significantly higher Kujala scores (87.9 ñ 11.3 vs 80.1 ñ 12.0, respectively; P =.006), lower redislocation rates (0.0% vs 11.8%, respectively; difference, 11.8% [95% CI, 0.9%-22.6%]; P =.045), and significantly better patellar alignment were detected in the cAMR group compared with the iACLR group postoperatively. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis determined that iACLR and partial lateral meniscectomy were significantly correlated with not achieving the MDC for the Lysholm score and worsening PFOA features in our study population. Conclusion: In patients after an ACL injury with PI, cAMR yielded better clinical and radiological outcomes compared with iACLR, with better patellar stability and a lower proportion of worsening PFOA features. Furthermore, not achieving the MDC for the Lysholm score and worsening PFOA features were significantly correlated with iACLR and partial lateral meniscectomy. Our study suggests that cAMR may be a more appropriate procedure for patients after an ACL injury with PI, which warrants further high-level clinical evidence. ? 2024 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465241226976,American Journal of Sports Medicine
865,SC-248,Sung et al. (2024),2024,Compensatory latency time delays during consecutive perturbations in older adults with and without kinesiophobia,"Background: Fear of movement has been related to lower limb activation patterns in older adults. However, insight into consecutive perturbations on stepping strategy while considering fall-related confidence is unknown. Research question: Are there latency time delays following three consecutive slip perturbations between subjects with and without kinesiophobia when considering limb dominance and fall efficacy differences? Methods: There were 15 older adults with kinesiophobia and 15 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects. The subjects stood on the platform during three consecutive perturbations (250, 300, and 400 msec excursions), which were produced by a Bertec device. The subjects completed questionnaires to evaluate the psychological features of their fall-related fear (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia: TSK) as well as the modified fall efficacy scale (FES). The latency times (msec) measured the time it took for a subject to respond to a translation. Results: Overall, the results of the FES demonstrated a moderate negative association with the TSK (r = ?0.52, p = 0.004). There was a significant group difference for the FES (t = 2.78, p = 0.01). The FES demonstrated significant positive correlation coefficients (ranging from 0.40 to 0.51) and significant negative correlation coefficients (ranging from ?0.41 to ?0.61), except for the slow perturbations. The groups demonstrated a significant interaction on consecutive latency times and limb side (F = 5.84, p = 0.02). The latency time during the fast perturbations on the dominant limb (F = 5.53, p = 0.02) was significantly shorter in the kinesiophobia group. Significance: The control group demonstrated confidence during fall-related activities, but the latency times were significantly different between groups when considering the dominant limb following repeated slip perturbations. The kinesiophobia group demonstrated shorter latency times on the dominant limb to protect against potential fall-risks from perturbations. The group interactions on limb side and consecutive perturbations need to be considered with fall-related confidence and improved standing balance in older adults with kinesiophobia. ? 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2024.01.012,Gait and Posture

LPFL is a lateralÿstabilizer of the patellofemoral joint. Reconstruction of LPFL is necessary to provide stability to the patella-femoral joint in patients with instability. We describe a novel technique of trans-osseous reconstruction of LPFL to gain stability and have better graft incorporation. A doubled peroneus longus graft is inserted into the patellar tunnel and secured with an endo button on the anteromedial aspect of the patella; the other end is then inserted into the insertional point on the femur and secured with an interference screw. This is an easy, novel, and reproducible technique which can be used to reconstruct LPFL. ? Indian Orthopaedics Association 2024.",Scopus,10.1007/s43465-023-01091-2,Indian Journal of Orthopaedics
867,SC-250,Guzm n-Mu¤oz et al. (2024),2024,Quadriceps muscle reaction time in obese children,"This study aimed to determine the influence of obesity, according to body mass index (BMI) and fat mass percentage, on quadriceps muscle reaction times. The study utilized a cross-sectional design. The sample size consisted of 42 schoolchildren (54.5% girls) aged 11 to 12 years old. Participant measurements included weight and height, which were used to categorize individuals based on BMI. Additionally, the electrical bioimpedance technique was employed to categorize participants based on their body fat percentage. A sudden destabilization test of the lower limb was performed to assess the reaction time of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis muscles. The results show that overweight/obese children have a longer muscle reaction time for both the rectus femoris (? = 18.13; p = 0.048) and the vastus lateralis (? = 14.51; p = 0.042). Likewise, when the children were classified by percentage of body fat the results showed that overfat/obese children have a longer muscle reaction time for both the rectus femoris (? = 18.13; p = 0.048) and the vastus lateralis (? = 14.51; p = 0.042). Our results indicate that BMI and fat mass classification negativity alter the muscle reaction time in children. Overweight/obese or overfat/obese children showed longer reaction times in the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis muscles compared to children with normal weight. Based on these findings, it is suggested that in overweight and obese children, efforts not only focus on reducing body weight but that be complemented with training and/or rehabilitation programs that focus on preserving the normal physiological function of the musculoskeletal system. ? 2024 Guzm n-Mu¤oz et al.",Scopus,10.7717/peerj.17050,PeerJ

Methods A retrospective case series study was conducted on the clinical data of 14 patients with chronic tendon rupture combined with defects admitted to Orthopedic Sports Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University from November 2017 to August 2020, including 11 males and 3 females, aged 26-62 years [(42.8ñ10.7)years]. All the patients underwent Achilles tendon reconstruction with half of peroneus longus tendon autograft. American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were compared before surgery, at 12 months after surgery and at the last follow-up. At the last follow-up, MRI of the injured ankle was prescribed to evaluate tendon healing; Thomspon test was performed and the patients were asked to do single-leg heel raise; the patients were asked about their conditions in returning to daily life activities and sports. Postoperative complications were observed. Results All the patients were followed up for 24-47 months [(35ñ9)months]. AOFAS score, ATRS and VAS at 12 months after surgery were (87.9ñ6.6)points, (80.9ñ2.4)points and (2.0ñ0.3)points respectively, superior to those before surgery [(52.7ñ16.9)points, (42.0ñ4.4)points and (4.1ñ0.4)points respectively] (P<0.05). The afore-mentioned results at the last follow-up were (95.2ñ7.2)points, (85.9ñ2.5)points and (0.8ñ0.3)points respectively, superior to those at 12 months after surgery (P<0.05). MRI images of the affected ankle joints showed satisfactory healing of the reconstructed Achilles tendon at the last follow-up. All the patients, being negative in Thompson test at the last follow-up, were able to complete the heel lift on the affected side. All the patients resumed activities of daily living at the last follow-up, among whom 5 resumed to moderate- to high-intensity sports activities, such as basketball sport, and moderate-to high-intensity physical training, 5 resumed light-intensity sports activities such as jogging and swimming, and the other 4 did not resume sports due to fear of re-injury or aging. One patient had delayed wound healing, which was considered gout-related. One patient complained about mild pain at the Achilles tendon in cold weather or after long walks. No re-rupture of the Achilles tendon occurred. No patient complained about discomfort at the graft harvest site, calcaneal valgus or restricted ankle plantar flexion. Conclusions For patients with chronic Achilles tendon rupture combined with tendon defects, reconstruction with half of peroneous longus tendon autograft facilitates postoperative spinal function recovery and pain alleviation, achieves satisfaction with the returning to daily activity and sports, and has few complications. ? 2024 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

In these situations, meniscal allograft transplantation is considered the gold standard. But allografts are not available in every part of the world. Collagen implants and synthetic polymers are also advocated. But again, its limited research, availability, and high cost have restricted its widespread use. Many authors have advocated autograft transplantation, but there are no long-term results, and there is a lack of uniform surgical techniques.

This study aimed to assess the impact of anticipation on joint orientation and muscle activity during landing in individuals with CAI. Fifteen participants with CAI and 15 healthy participants (control) were recruited to perform single-leg landings after bilateral countermovement jumps when the landing limb was specified before (planned) or after (unplanned) take-off. Joint angle (hip, knee, and ankle) and electromyography (gluteus medius, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius lateral head, tibialis anterior, and peroneal longus) were collected and analyzed with 2 (groups) ? 2 (conditions) statistical parametric mapping ANOVA. In the unplanned condition, the CAI group demonstrated a less plantarflexed (maximum difference [MD] = 9.5ø, p = 0.047) and more inverted ankle joint (MD = 4.1ø, p < 0.001) before ground contact, along with lower peroneal activity at ground contact compared to the control group (MD = 28.9% of peak activation, p < 0.001). No significant differences between groups were observed in the planned condition. In conclusion, anticipation may mask jump landing deficits in people with CAI, including inverted ankle orientation and reduced peroneus longus activity pre- and post-landing, which were observed exclusively in unplanned landings. Clinicians and researchers need to recognize the impact of anticipation on apparent landing deficits and consider the implications for injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies. ? 2024 The Authors.

Part 3: Recommendation on surgical treatment,"Purpose: The aim of this consensus project was to give recommendations regarding surgical treatment of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injured patient. Methods: For this consensus process, an expert, steeringÿand rating group was formed. In an initial online meeting, the steering group, together with the expert group, formed various key topic complexes for which multiple questions were formulated. For each key topic, a structured literature search was performed by the steering group. The results of the literature review were sent to the rating group with the option to give anonymous comments until a final consensus voting was performed. Sufficient consensus was defined as 80% agreement. Results: During this consensus process, 30 topics regarding the surgical management and technique of ACL reconstruction were identified. The literature search for each key question resulted in 30 final statements. Of these 30 final statements, all achieved consensus. Conclusions: This consensus process has shown that surgical treatment of ACL injury is a complex process. Various surgical factors influence patient outcomes. The proposed treatment algorithm can be used as a decision aid for the surgeon.

Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. Results: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/- 0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/- 0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre-op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre-op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre-op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre-op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/- 2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon appears to be a better autograft choice than hamstrings for primary ACL reconstruction. Further, without a peroneal tenodesis, the functional outcomes of the donor ankle remained excellent. ? 2024 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

873,SC-256,Kobayashi et al. (2024),2024,Morphological and mechanical characteristics of the intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles under loading in individuals with flat feet,"Background: The intrinsic and extrinsic foot softtissue structures that apply force and support the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) have been implicated in the development of flat feet. However, the relationship between the changes in MLA height under increasing load and the morphological and mechanical properties of individual intrinsic and extrinsic foot soft tissue structures is not fully understood. Research question: To examine the morphological and mechanical characteristics of the foot soft tissue structures in flat feet when subjected to loading. Methods: This study consisted of two studies focusing on the extrinsic foot muscles (10 normal feet/11 flat feet) and intrinsic foot muscles (14 normal feet/13 flat feet). Images of the extrinsic and intrinsic foot muscles and plantar fascia (PF) under 10%, 50%, and 90% body weight conditions were obtained using ultrasound-based shear-wave elastography. Results: The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the peroneus brevis was larger in the flat-foot group than in the normal-foot group under all loading conditions. The CSAs of the intrinsic foot muscles (abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis, and quadratus plantae) and thickness of the PF in the flat-foot group decreased significantly with increasing load. As for mechanical characteristics, the stiffness of the flexor digitorum longus and abductor hallucis was higher in the flat-foot group than in the normal group under high loading conditions. In addition, flat feet with greater flexibility tended to exhibit a greater decrease in PF thickness and smaller increase in stiffness. Significance: Excessive stretching of the intrinsic foot muscles and PF occurs in flat feet, and excessive contraction of the flexor digitorum longus may counteract the excessive lowering of the foot arch. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the contraction of the intrinsic foot musculature in feet with greater flexibility of the MLA during loading. ? 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2023.11.001,Gait and Posture
874,SC-257,Blasimann et al. (2024),2024,Bilateral neuromuscular control in patients one year after unilateral ACL rupture or reconstruction. A cross-sectional study,"Objectives: To compare bilateral neuromuscular control in patients one year after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) or conservative treatment (ACL-C) to healthy controls (ACL-I). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Electromyography of vastus medialis (VM) and lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) was recorded during stair descent and anterior tibial translation. Each step of stair descent was divided into pre-activity, weight-acceptance and push-off phase. Pre-activation, short, medium (MLR) and long latency responses (LLR) were defined for reflex activity. Participants: N = 38 patients one year after ACL reconstruction (ACL-R), N = 26 participants with conservative treatment one year after ACL rupture (ACL-C), N = 38 healthy controls with an intact ACL (ACL-I). Main outcome measures: Normalized root mean squares per muscle and phase (à = 0.05). Results: During stair descent, within-group leg differences were found for the quadriceps in ACL-R during all phases and for the BF in ACL-C during weight-acceptance. Between-group leg differences were found for BF in both patient groups compared to ACL-I during push-off. Between-group differences in pre-activation for VM between ACL-R and ACL-C, and between ACL-C and ACL-I were found, and as LLR between patients and ACL-R versus ACL-I. Pre-activation of BF and MLR of ST differed for each patient group compared to ACL-I. Conclusions: Bilateral neuromuscular alterations are still present one year after ACL rupture or reconstruction. ? 2024 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24364,Heliyon

(2024),2024,Local Firework Restrictions and Ocular Trauma,"Importance: Fireworks can cause vision-threatening injuries, but the association of local legislation with the mitigation of these injuries is unclear. Objective: To evaluate the odds of firework-related ocular trauma among residents of areas where fireworks are permitted vs banned. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study was conducted at a level 1 trauma center in Seattle, Washington, among 230 patients presenting with ocular trauma in the 2 weeks surrounding the Independence Day holiday, spanning June 28 to July 11, over an 8-year period (2016-2022). Exposures: Firework ban status of patient residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of firework-related injuries among residents of areas where fireworks are legal vs where they are banned, calculated as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Results: Of 230 consultations for ocular trauma during the study period, 94 patients (mean [SD] age, 25 [14] years; 86 male patients [92%]) sustained firework-related injuries, and 136 (mean [SD] age, 43 [23] years; 104 male patients [77%]) sustained non-firework-related injuries. The odds of firework-related ocular trauma were higher among those living in an area where fireworks were legal compared with those living in an area where fireworks were banned (OR, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.2-3.5]; P =.01). In addition, the odds of firework injuries were higher for patients younger than 18 years (OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.7-5.8]; P <.001) and for male patients (OR, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.5-7.1]; P =.004). Firework injuries were more likely to be vision threatening (54 of 94 [57%]) compared with non-firework-related injuries (54 of 136 [40%]; OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.2-3.5]; P =.01). Conclusions and Relevance: This case-control study suggests that the odds of firework-related ocular trauma were slightly higher among residents of areas where fireworks were legal compared with residents of areas where fireworks were banned. Although these results suggest that local firework bans may be associated with a small reduction in the odds of firework-related ocular trauma, additional studies are warranted to assess what actions might lead to greater reductions. ? 2024 American Medical Association.

876,SC-259,Zhong et al. (2024),2024,Effects of dual-task paradigm on the injury potential during landing among individuals with chronic ankle instability,"Purpose: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) causes maladaptive neuroplastic changes in the central nervous system, which may lead to high injury potential under dual-task conditions. This study aims to explore the effects of dual-task paradigm on the injury potential during landing among individuals with CAI. Methods: Twenty participants with CAI (4 female and 16 male, 12 were affected with their right limbs and 8 were affected with their left limbs, 20.4 ñ 1.7 years, 176.9 ñ 5.0 cm, and 72.0 ñ 11.1 kg) and eighteen without CAI (6 female and 12 male, 20.2 ñ 1.5 years, 173.5 ñ 7.0 cm, and 70.3 ñ 10.8 kg) were recruited. They drop-landed on a trap-door device, with their affected or matched limbs on a flippable platform, under single- (drop-landing only) and dual-task (drop-landing while subtracting of serial threes) conditions. A twelve-camera motion capture system was used to capture the kinematic data. Two-way ANOVA with mixed design (CAI vs non-CAI groups by single-vs dual-task conditions) was used to analyze the data. Results: Significant group-by-condition interactions were detected in the ankle inversion angle (P = 0.040, ?2<inf>p</inf> = 0.012) and ankle inversion angular velocity (P = 0.038, ?2<inf>p</inf> = 0.114). Both indicators decreased among individuals without CAI from single-to dual-task conditions, while remained unchanged among those with CAI; and they were higher among individuals with CAI under both single- and dual-task conditions, compared to those without CAI. Conclusion: Individuals with CAI have a reduced ability to limit ankle inversion compared to those without CAI. Under dual-task conditions, individuals without CAI limited their ankle inversion, while those with CAI did not. Drop-landing, especially under dual-task conditions, poses a high risk of excessive ankle inversion for individuals with CAI. ? ? 2024 Zhong, Luo, Gao, Zhang, Zhu, Huang and Shen.",Scopus,10.3389/fphys.2024.1473844,Frontiers in Physiology

878,SC-261,Liang et al. (2024),2024,Impact of various training programs on lower limb biomechanics in adolescent Latin dancers,"Latin dance attracts many young dancers globally. While these adolescents exhibit flexibility and imitation skills, their muscular strength and neuromuscular control often fall short, making complex movements challenging. Thus, incorporating functional training methods is essential for enhancing performance and reducing injury risk. This study, a total of 30 adolescent female Latin dancers aged 12?14 years with at least one year of training and competition experience were recruited for this study and randomly divided into two groups: One group of 15 students (average height 154.37 ñ3.82 cm, average weight 45.31 ñ5.29 kg) received traditional Latin dance training, and the other group of 15 students (15 students average height 154.73 ñ4.28 cm, average weight 44.63 ñ4.37 kg) received traditional Latin dance training and based on traditional Latin dance training, functional exercise was carried out for 12 weeks. A Vicon motion capture system, force platform, and electromyography were used to collect biomechanical data. Paired samples t-tests assessed significant differences between groups pre- and post-intervention. The experimental group showed significant improvements post-intervention: in the sagittal plane, ankle joint angles improved by 14.01% to 52.21% (p < 0.001); in the coronal plane, knee joint angles increased by 0% to 31.21% (p < 0.001) and 66.67% to 100% (p < 0.001); in the horizontal plane, hip joint angles improved by 4.99% to 76.00% (p < 0.001). Muscle activation showed significant increases in gastrocnemius lateral (p = 0.016), gluteus maximus (p = 0.001), tibialis anterior (p = 0.014), and rectus femoris (p < 0.001). Functional training enhances joint flexibility, muscle activation, balance, and overall performance in adolescent Latin dancers. Integrating functional training into regular routines can improve athletic performance and lower injury risk, informing the development of targeted training programs. ? 2024 by author(s).",Scopus,10.62617/mcb.v21i2.436,MCB Molecular and Cellular Biomechanics

880,SC-263,G”k et al. (2024),2024,Peroneus Longus vs Hamstring Tendon Autografts in ACL Reconstruction: A Comparative Study of 106 Patients? Outcomes,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction commonly uses a hamstring tendon autograft, but the peroneus longus tendon can also be used. This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. Material/Methods: ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56ñ0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44ñ0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46ñ3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48ñ4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. Conclusions: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain. The peroneus longus tendon, with its larger diameter, fewer graft-related complications, and similar knee scores compared to the hamstring group, is considered a suitable alternative graft source. ?

(2024),2024,Two Experiments for Automatic Scoring of Handwritten Descriptive Answers,"This paper presents our motivation, design and two experiments for automatic scoring of handwritten descriptive answers. The first experiment is on scoring of handwritten short descriptive answers in Japanese language exams. We used a deep neural network (DNN)-based handwriting recognizer and a transformer-based automatic scorer without correcting misrecognized characters or adding rubric annotations for scoring. We achieved acceptable agreement between the automatic scoring and the human scoring, while using only 1.7% of the human-scored answers for training. The second experiment is to score descriptive answers written on electronic paper for Japanese, English, and math drills. We used DNN-based online and offline handwriting recognizers for each subject and took simple perfect matching of recognized candidates with correct answers. The experiment shows that the False Negative rate is reduced by combining the online and offline recognizers and the False Positive rate is reduced by rejecting low recognition scores. Even with the current system, human scorers only need to manually score less than 30% of the answers, with false positive (risky) scores of about 2% or less for the three subjects. ?

882,SC-265,Gofer et al. (2024),2024,Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft for One-Stage Revision ACL Reconstruction: Mid-Term Results,"Background. The results of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are usually worse than the primary ACLR. The positive outcome of the revision ACLR is significantly influenced by the following factors: anatomical position of bone tunnels, correct choice of graft, its preparation and fixation method. Equally important is to choose the accurate indications for additional extraarticular interventions. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft in one-stage revision ACL reconstruction and to compare the obtained data with the results of primary ACLR. Methods. The comparison was carried out between the RACL-PLT group (n = 29) and the PACL-HT group (n = 82), which underwent single-stage revision ACLR with a PLT autograft and primary ACLR with a hamstring tendons (HT) autograft, respectively. Subjective and objective evaluation was performed on the KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm Knee scales. Also, in the RACL-PLT group, the position of the central entry points into the primary and revision tunnels was determined. Results. We observed no statistically significant differences during the objective assessment of knee joint stability between the groups (p>0.999). During the subjective assessment on the KOOS, IKDC and Lysholm Knee scales, significantly higher results were obtained in the PACL-HT group (p<0.001). The position of the central entry points into the revision tunnels corresponded to the normative values in all cases. Conclusions. The analysis of the use of a PLT autograft in revision ACLR, as well as the achievement of the anatomical position of the revision tunnels showed: 12 months after surgery, the results of an objective assessment between the revision and primary ACLR are comparable; the results of a subjective assessment are statistically significantly different. However, the differences in indicators do not reach a minimal clinically important difference. ?

(2024),2024,Relevant Biomechanical Variables in Skateboarding: A Literature Review,"Skateboarding, once regarded primarily as a means of transportation and entertainment for youth, has become a recognized professional sport, gaining global popularity. With its recent inclusion in the Olympics, a growing imperative exists to comprehensively understand biomechanics explaining skateboarding performance. This literature review seeks to consolidate knowledge within this domain, focusing on experimental and modeling studies about skateboard riding and tricks. The criteria for study selection encompassed content relevance and publication year, spanning from the last two decades and extending further back to 1980 following cross-referencing of seminal works. Peer-reviewed journal articles, conference proceedings, and books were considered, with comprehensive searches conducted on electronic databases, including SCOPUS, PubMed, Scielo, and Taylor & Francis. Comprehending the biomechanical facets of skateboarding is essential in promoting its use and ensuring safety among all practitioners. Insights into factors such as body kinetics, kinematics, and muscle activation represent a foundational step toward understanding the nuances of this sport with implications for both clinical and biomechanical research. Modern data collection systems such as inertial measurement units (IMU) and electromyography (EMG) offer unprecedented insights into human performance during skateboarding, such as joint range of motion, coordination, and muscle activation, whether in casual riding or executing complex tricks and maneuvers. Developing robust modeling approaches also holds promise for enhancing skateboarding training and performance. Crucially, these models can serve as the initial framework for understanding injury mechanisms and implementing strategies to improve performance and mitigate injury risks. ? 2024 by Begell House, Inc.",Scopus,10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2024052903,Critical Reviews in Biomedical Engineering
887,SC-270,Liu et al. (2024),2024,Patients with chronic ankle instability exhibit increased sensorimotor cortex activation and correlation with poorer lateral balance control ability during single-leg stance: a FNIRS study,"Introduction: Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI) is a musculoskeletal condition that evolves from acute ankle sprains, and its underlying mechanisms have yet to reach a consensus. Mounting evidence suggests that neuroplastic changes in the brain following ankle injuries play a pivotal role in the development of CAI. Balance deficits are a significant risk factor associated with CAI, yet there is a scarcity of evidence regarding the sensorimotor cortical plasticity related to balance control in affected individuals. This study aims to evaluate the differences in cortical activity and balance abilities between patients with CAI and uninjured individuals during a single-leg stance, as well as the correlation between these factors, in order to elucidate the neurophysiological alterations in balance control among patients with CAI. Methods: The study enrolled 24 patients with CAI and 24 uninjured participants. During single-leg stance, cortical activity was measured using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system, which included assessments of the pre-motor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor area (SMA), primary motor cortex (M1), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Concurrently, balance parameters were tested utilizing a three-dimensional force platform. Results: Independent sample t-tests revealed that, compared with the uninjured individuals, the patients with CAI exhibited a significant increase in the changes of oxyhemoglobin concentration (?HbO) during single-leg stance within the left S1 at Channel 5 (t = 2.101, p = 0.041, Cohen?s d = 0.607), left M1 at Channel 6 (t = 2.363, p = 0.022, Cohen?s d = 0.682), right M1 at Channel 15 (t = 2.273, p = 0.029, Cohen?s d = 0.656), and right PMC/SMA at Channel 11 (t = 2.467, p = 0.018, Cohen?s d = 0.712). Additionally, the center of pressure root mean square (COP-RMS) in the mediolateral (ML) direction was significantly greater (t = 2.630, p = 0.012, Cohen?s d = 0.759) in the patients with CAI. Furthermore, a moderate positive correlation was found between ML direction COP-RMS and ?HbO2 in the M1 (r = 0.436; p = 0.033) and PMC/SMA (r = 0.488, p = 0.016), as well as between anteroposterior (AP) direction COP-RMS and ?HbO in the M1 (r = 0.483, p = 0.017). Conclusion: Patients with CAI demonstrate increased cortical activation in the bilateral M1, ipsilateral PMC/SMA, and contralateral S1. This suggests that patients with CAI may require additional brain resources to maintain balance during single-leg stance, representing a compensatory mechanism to uphold task performance amidst diminished lateral balance ability in the ankle joint. ? ? 2024 Liu, Yang, Song, Yang and Chen.",Scopus,10.3389/fnhum.2024.1366443,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
888,SC-271,Gofer et al. (2024),2024,Mid-term Results of a Single-Stage Revision Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Retrospective Analysis of 36 Cases,"Background. Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is becoming more and more common in the knee surgery due to the annual increase in the number of primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. Choosing the most suitable graft and determining the staging of the surgical treatment by preoperative assessment of the possibility of performing the most anatomical revision canals and their interposition with the primary canals are the main factors that influence treatment results. Aim of the study ? comparative assessment of the results of using hamstring tendon and peroneus longus tendon autografts in a one-stage revision reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods. A retrospective analysis of the medical records of 36 patients who underwent revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed. The patients were divided into two groups: in the patients of the study group (n = 19) a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft was used, in the comparison group (n = 17) a hamstring tendon autograft (HT) was applied. Subjective and objective evaluation using the KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm scales was performed, and position of the central entry points of the primary and revision canals was determined. There were no statistically significant differences in the objective assessment of the knee joint stability. Significantly better results of subjective assessment of the knee function according to the Lysholm and KOOS scales were obtained in the PLT group (p = 0.042 and p<0.001, respectively). Position of revision canals corresponded to the standard values, but position of the femoral canal had a slight cranial and anterior displacement. It was also found that the PLT graft diameter was statistically significantly larger than the HT graft diameter (p<0.001). Results. There were no statistically significant differences in the objective assessment of the knee joint stability. Significantly better results of subjective assessment of the knee function according to the Lysholm and KOOS scales were obtained in the PLT group (p = 0.042 and p<0.001, respectively). Position of revision canals corresponded to the standard values, but position of the femoral canal had a slight cranial and anterior displacement. It was also found that the PLT graft diameter was statistically significantly larger than the HT graft diameter (p<0.001). Conclusion.

(2024),2024,The healing effect of the all inside technique is superior to the traditional technique in the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament,"Our main objective was to examine the curative effect of all inside technique and traditional technique in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. In our retrospective study at the First People's Hospital of Jiashan County, we analyzed 88 participants with ACL injuries (50 males, 38 females, average age 27 years). They were randomly divided into two groups: traditional ACL reconstruction (42 participants) and all inside ACL reconstruction (46 participants). We measured and recorded the Visual Analog Scores (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm scores, operation time, graft diameter and length between the traditional technique group and all inside technique group. There were statistically significant differences in the Lysholm scores and IKDC scores between traditional and all inside technique groups. The all inside technique showed a higher efficacy and effective post-operative recovery with minimal pain and recurrent injuries. Our findings showed that the differences in gender, age, side of injury and operation time were not significant (p> 0.05). Follow-up was conducted at 6 months and 12 months post operations (mean, 7.5 ñ 1.1 months). All inside technique minimizing tissue disruption, optimizing graft placement and facilitating early recovery have a significant impact on patient outcomes. ? 2024 Page Press Publications.

Design: Quasi-experimental study. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Twenty-six individuals with CAI and 26 healthy controls. Main outcome measures: Center of pressure variables (mean total velocity and displacement in anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions) during single-leg standing with eyes open and eyes closed and also reach distances in anterior (ANT), posteromedial (PM), and posterolateral (PL) directions of the modified star excursion balance test (MSEBT) were assessed before and after LMV. Results: Statistical analyses showed a significant decrease in mean total velocity and displacement in AP direction from before to after LMV in eyes open condition for both individuals with CAI (p = 0.025, p = 0.041, respectively) and healthy controls (p = 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). Similar results were observed in eyes closed condition for both individuals with CAI (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively) and healthy controls (p = 0.040, p = 0.014, respectively). The results also showed increased reach distances in ANT (p < 0.001), PM (p < 0.001), and PL directions (p < 0.001) in all participants after LMV. Conclusion: Our results suggest that LMV may be a useful tool in rehabilitation of static and dynamic balance deficits in individuals with CAI. ? 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2023.11.008,Physical Therapy in Sport

892,SC-275,Jang et al. (2024),2024,Muscle contributions to reduced ankle joint contact force during drop vertical jumps in patients with chronic ankle instability,"Chronic ankle instability is a condition linked to progressive early ankle joint degeneration. Patients with chronic ankle instability exhibit altered biomechanics during gait and jump landings and these alterations are believed to contribute to aberrant joint loading and subsequent joint degeneration. Musculoskeletal modeling has the capacity to estimate joint loads from individual muscle forces. However, the influence of chronic ankle instability on joint contact forces remains largely unknown. The objective of this study was to compare tri-axial (i.e., compressive, anterior-posterior, and medial?lateral) ankle joint contact forces between those with and without chronic ankle instability during the ground contact phase of a drop vertical jump. Fifteen individuals with and 15 individuals without chronic ankle instability completed drop vertical jump maneuvers in a research laboratory. We used those data to drive three-dimensional musculoskeletal simulations and estimate muscle forces and tri-axial joint contact force variables (i.e., peak and impulse). Compared to those without chronic ankle instability, the ankles of patients with chronic ankle instability underwent lower compressive ankle joint contact forces as well as lower anterior-posterior and medial?lateral shearing forces during the weight acceptance phase of landing (p <.05). These findings suggest that patients with chronic ankle instability exhibit lower ankle joint loading patterns than uninjured individuals during a drop vertical jump, which may be considered in rehabilitation to potentially reduce the risk of early onset of ankle joint degeneration. ? 2024",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2024.111926,Journal of Biomechanics
893,SC-276,G”kler et al. (2024),2024,The effect of sterilization and storage on the viscoelastic properties of human tendon allografts ? Continued: Storage for 0 to 4 months,"The role of donor-derived tendons, also known as allografts, in anterior cruciate ligament replacement surgeries is steadily increasing. Before surgery, temporary storage and, in most cases, sterilization are essential. It is, thus, crucial to determine how these procedures alter the grafts? biomechanical properties. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of different sterilization methods (native, frozen, frozen + 21 kGy gamma irradiation, frozen + 21 kGy electron beam irradiation) and storage durations (0 to 4 months) on the deformation and creep of two tendon types (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus). 80 tibialis anterior and 83 peroneus longus tendons from 51 human cadavers were included. The samples were removed, placed in a radio-cryoprotectant solution, then slowly cooled, sterilized and stored at ?80 øC. All groups were subject to 60 s static creep test with 250 N load. Deformation during the loading phase, creep during static loading, and the ratio of these two were evaluated. Deformation at the end of the loading phase and creep consistently exhibited significantly smaller values in the tibialis anterior compared to the peroneus longus type, as well as in electron beam-sterilized grafts as opposed to gamma beam-sterilized ones. Prolonged storage periods (within 0 to 4 months) resulted in a notable increase in these values, particularly in deformation. Based on the experimental data, the tibialis anterior tendon type and sterilization by gamma beam irradiation are better choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than the peroneus longus and sterilization by electron beam. Increased storage time affects negatively the evaluated mechanical properties. ? 2023 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2023.111904,Journal of Biomechanics
894,SC-277,Barak et al. (2024),2024,The trabecular architecture of the popliteal sesamoid bone (cyamella) from a New Zealand white rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus),"Sesamoid bones are ossified structures that are embedded in tendons near articulation. They consist of an inner trabecular bone architecture surrounded by a thin cortical shell. While the formation of sesamoid bones is probably mainly controlled by genetic factors, the proper development and mineralization of a sesamoid bone depends also on mechanical stimulation. While most sesamoid bones are not loaded directly by other bones during locomotion, they still experience forces directed from the tendon in which they are embedded. In cases when the sesamoid bone is experiencing forces only from a single tendon, such as the cyamella in the rabbit, this may give us a tool to study bone functional adaptation in a relatively simple loading setting. This study investigates the internal trabecular architecture of the popliteal sesamoid bone (cyamellae) in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Five hind limbs of NZW rabbits were micro-computed tomography scanned and the cortical and trabecular architectures of the cyamellae were evaluated. The results revealed that similar to the patella, the cyamella has a thin cortex and a high trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), which is derived mostly from the high trabecular thickness (Tb.Th). Trabecular BV/TV and Tb.Th were not distributed homogeneously, but they were lower at the periphery and higher closer to the proximal and middle of the cyamella, near the musculotendinous junction. The results also demonstrated that trabeculae tend to align along two recognizable orientations, one with the direction of tensile stresses, in line with the popliteal tendon, and the second bridging the narrow space between the cranial and caudal cortical faces of the bone. ? 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Scopus,10.1002/jmor.21660,Journal of Morphology

(2024),2024,Muscle activation while running on the ground compared to artificial turf in males with pronated and supinated feet,"Background: Running on different surfaces, including natural and artificial surfaces, requires different gait mechanics, especially in individuals with foot deformity. Research question: How muscle activity change during running on the ground and artificial turf in males with pronated and supinated feet? Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, we assessed a cohort of young male subjects, classified as healthy (n = 10), and with pronated (n = 10) or supinated (n = 10) feet. An electromyographic system was used to record lower limb muscle activity while running on the ground and artificial turf at constant speed (3.2 m/s). Results: Results demonstrated significant main effects of the ?surface? factor for vastus medialis activity during the loading phase (p = 0.040, ?2 =0.147). Paired comparison revealed significantly greater vastus medialis activity while running on artificial grass with respect to the ground. A significant effect of the ?group? factor was found for medial gastrocnemius during loading phase (p = 0.020, ?2 =0.250). Paired-wise comparison revealed significantly lower medial gastrocnemius activity in the pronated and supinated feet groups than in the healthy group. Significance: The healthy group may possess better neuromuscular control, allowing them to effectively coordinate the activation of the medial gastrocnemius with other muscles involved in running. Based on these findings, running on artificial turf is useful when the runner would like to strengthen vastus medialis muscle. The runner should carefully choose the running surface according to his/her state and training session goal. ? 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2023.10.020,Gait and Posture

(2024),2024,Outcome of percutaneous reconstruction of chronic lateral collateral ligament rupture,"Purpose: Many techniques have been described for the reconstruction of chronic lateral collateral ligament (LCL) rupture with different autograft options. The advantages of percutaneous LCL reconstruction include small incisions, minimal soft tissue disruption, less postoperative pain, and speedy rehabilitation and recovery. The aim of this study was to report the functional outcome of percutaneous LCL reconstruction and overall patient satisfaction in Africans. Methods: This prospective and interventional study involving 51 patients with chronic LCL rupture who had percutaneous LCL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft was conducted between January 2021 and December 2022 in National Orthopaedic Hospital, Dala-Kano, Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were patients between the ages of 18 and 45 years with chronic isolated LCL and not more than 1 injury of knee ligament. Exclusion criteria were active infection, and multi-ligament knee injury requiring 2-staged surgery. The knee functions were assessed preoperatively, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively using the Lysholm scoring system. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of the treatment was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Relevant information was recorded into Microsoft Excel sheet and data was analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 for windows. The paired samples t-test was used to compare the clinical outcomes as continuous variables. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. Results: The mean age of the patients was (30.10 ñ 5.90) years. The median time from injury to surgery was 7 months (ranging from 3 to 28 months). The mean follow-up period was (14.07 ñ 3.13) months. The mean preoperative and 1-year postoperative Lysholm scores were 44.33 ñ 12.97 and 97.96 ñ 1.23, respectively. Conclusion: Percutaneous LCL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft significantly improves patient knee function and results in excellent patient satisfaction. ? 2023 Chinese Medical Association",Scopus,10.1016/j.cjtee.2023.09.004,Chinese Journal of Traumatology - English Edition
897,SC-280,Adhitya et al. (2024),2024,Predictors of lower knee function improvement two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Objectives: The extent to which knee functions improve after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) varies. This study aimed to determine the factors that affect lower knee function improvement after two years of ACLR. Methods: The study included 159 patients who underwent ACLR in the Indonesian ACL community between August 2018 and April 2020. The concomitant injury and graft types of ACLR were determined using patients? pre-surgical MRI and medical records. The five subscales of the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) were used to evaluate the patient at baseline, first year, and second year following ACLR. A linear mixed-effect model (LMEM) was used to predict the longitudinal improvement models for the five-subscales KOOS score after ACLR. Results: The LMEM predicted lower KOOS subscales scores improvements by 0.5 for QOL, 0.1 for symptom, ADL, and QOL, and 0.2 for sports/recreation, respectively, for a one score increase of age and time from injury to surgery. Male patients had higher KOOS subscale scores with the improvement of pain, symptom, and ADL by 5.7, 5.9, and 6.3 compared to female patients, respectively, while patients with patellar tendon grafts had lower improvement of KOOS score pain by 6.5 compared to hamstring tendon grafts. Conclusion: As the age and time from injury to surgery increased, the KOOS subscales scores of QOL and symptoms, ADL, sports/recreation, and QOL decreased. Male patients reported higher KOOS subscales scores for pain, symptoms, and ADL, while patients with patella tendon grafts had a lower improvement in pain score. ? 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,10.1080/00913847.2023.2217877,Physician and Sportsmedicine
898,SC-281,Pan et al. (2024),2024,Characteristics of muscle synergy and anticipatory synergy adjustments strategy when cutting in different angles,"Background: Cutting is a quick change of direction that challenges body balance and stability. As the cut-angle increases, the elite athlete can achieve higher performance by pre-adjusting the posture of the lower limb joints. However, it is unclear how the cut-angle affects the neuromuscular control of cutting and the step before cutting, which is essential for daily training and preventing injury in large-angle cutting. Research question: The purpose of this study was to determine how neuromuscular control strategies change under different angles for cutting and the step before cutting Methods: Non-negative matrix factorisation and K-means clustering were used to extract muscle synergy in the trunk and lower limbs of 12 athletes when cutting at different angles. Uncontrolled manifold analysis was used to clarify whether the muscle synergy fluctuations in the step before cutting were beneficial in stabilising the COP during the cutting. Results: This study found that the angle did not affect the number of muscle synergies either in the cutting or the step before the cutting. As the angle increases, the activation timing of synergy module 2 during cutting moves forward and is tightly integrated with module 1. The combined synergy at 90ø accounted for the largest proportion of either cutting or the step before cutting and had a lower synergy index. Significance: Muscle synergy can respond to large-angle cutting through flexible combinations. The muscle synergy for 90ø cutting is less regular and has a lower degree of anticipatory synergy adjustments, which may result in poorer postural stability and an increased risk of lower limb joint injury during cutting. ? 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2023.03.010,Gait and Posture
899,SC-282,Xue et al. (2024),2024,Postural Control Deficits During Static Single-leg Stance in Chronic Ankle Instability: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Context: Postural control deficits arising from injured ankles are central to chronic ankle instability (CAI) and its persistent symptoms. This is usually measured by recording the center of pressure (CoP) trajectory during static single-leg stance using a stable force plate. However, existing studies have produced conflicting results on whether this mode of measurement adequately reveals the postural deficits in CAI. Objective: To determine whether postural control during static single-leg stance is impaired in CAI patients when compared with uninjured healthy controls. Data Sources: Literature databases, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus, were searched from inception to April 1, 2022, using ankle-, injury-, and posture-related terms. Study Selection: Two authors independently performed the step-by-step screening of article titles, abstracts, and full texts to select peer-reviewed studies investigating CoP trajectory during static single-leg stance using a stable force plate in CAI patients and healthy controls. A total of 13,637 studies were reviewed, and 38 studies (0.003%) met the selection criteria. Study Design: Meta-analyses of descriptive epidemiological study. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Data Extraction: CoP parameters, sway directions, visual condition, and numerical data (means and standard deviations) were extracted. Results: The injured ankles of CAI patients had higher standard deviations of sway amplitude in both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.36 and 0.31, respectively) under conditions of open eyes than controls. Higher mean sway velocity in anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and total directions (SMD = 0.41, 0.37, and 0.45, respectively) with closed eyes was also found. Conclusion: CAI patients had deficits of postural control during static single-leg stance, and these deficits were identified by the CoP trajectory. Further methodological explorations of CoP parameters and corresponding test conditions are required to enhance the sensitivity and reliability of postural deficit assessments in CAI using force plates. ? 2023 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/19417381231152490,Sports Health
900,SC-283,Kim et al. (2024),2024,What interventions can treat arthrogenic muscle inhibition in patients with chronic ankle instability? A systematic review with meta-analysis,"Purpose: To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize the existing evidence regarding the effects of therapeutic interventions on arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Materials and methods: Two reviewers independently performed exhaustive database searches in Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus. Results: Nine studies were finally included. Five types of disinhibitory interventions were identified: focal ankle joint cooling (FAJC), manual therapy, fibular reposition taping (FRT), whole-body vibration (WBV), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). There were moderate effects of FAJC on spinal excitability in ankle muscles (g = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.03?1.08, p = 0.040 for the soleus and g = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.01?1.07, p = 0.046 for the fibularis longus). In contrast, manual therapy, FRT, WBV were not effective. Finally, 4 weeks of tDCS combined with eccentric exercise showed large effects on corticospinal excitability in 2 weeks after the intervention (g = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.14?1.85 for the fibularis longus and g = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.16?1.87 for the tibialis anterior). Conclusions: FAJC and tDCS may be effective in counteracting AMI. However, the current evidence of mainly short-term studies to support the use of disinhibitory interventions is too limited to draw definitive conclusions. ? 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,10.1080/09638288.2022.2161643,Disability and Rehabilitation
901,SC-284,Slawaska-Eng et al. (2024),2024,Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Clinical and Functional Outcomes,"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the world. As such, functional and clinical outcomes following ACLR are a very well-studied topic in the orthopedic literature. The most widely used measures to assess ACLR outcomes are validated patient reported outcome measurements (PROMs) such as the Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS). Despite their subjective nature, they do provide valuable insight into the functional outcomes of ACLR. Other important clinical outcomes following ACLR are return to sport (RTS), graft failure (or rerupture), and postoperative complications.As PROMs are based on patient perception, they are inherently subjective. Other outcome measurements of ACL laxity such as the anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot-shift - which have their own standardized grading schemes - may offer more objectivity in a clinical setting. However, they may only display moderate levels of interrater reliability. More truly objective methods of ACL laxity measurement are available such as the KT-1000 arthrometer, but they are not widely used in a clinical setting.The focus of this chapter will be to describe factors that influence clinical and functional outcomes after primary ACL reconstruction. To do so, several patient and surgical factors have been selected and categorized into three perioperative time points - preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors. ?

(2024),2024,Management of Posterolateral Corner Injury in the Multiligament Injured Knee,"The primary stabilizers of the posterolateral corner (PLC) are the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), the popliteus tendon (PLT), and the popliteofibular ligament (PFL), and they all serve as primary stabilizers against external rotation and varus opening forces. Historically, the PLC has been considered complex and was even termed ?the dark side of the knee?; however, a systematic approach by studying the anatomy and biomechanics has improved our understanding. These studies have led to development of anatomic-based reconstructions which improve knee function and patient outcomes. It is important to recognize these injuries and treat them early because missed or untreated injuries can lead to poor function, failure of reconstructed cruciate ligaments. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that anatomic reconstructions are superior to repairs for torn PLC structures; therefore, reconstruction for grade III injuries should be attempted early when possible. ?

904,SC-287,Saeed et al. (2023),2023,"Earlier Return to Sports, Reduced Donor-Site Morbidity with Doubled Peroneus Longus Versus Quadrupled Hamstring Tendon Autograft in ACL Reconstruction","Background:Graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has been evolving. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied.Methods:Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared.Results:The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up.Conclusions:PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level II.

Place and Duration of Study: Orthopedic Department, Combined Military Hospital, Lahore Pakistan, from Jul 2020 to Jun 2021. Methodology: We included all the patients who underwent ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Fixation was achieved with a bio-absorbable screw on the tibial side and an endobutton on the femoral side. Lateral or medial menisectomy was performed according to the requirement. Post-op X-rays were done to assess the position of the endobutton and tibial tunnel. Eight millimetres tunnels were drilled, and the tendon was tailored accordingly. Results were assessed for pain, infection, range of motion and instability after three months of surgical procedure. Results: A total of 52 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age of the study participants was 33.36ñ6.353 years. At the end of three months, pain 6(11.5%) and restricted range of motion 6(11.5%) were the common untoward outcomes reported by the patients. High body mass index and lack of engagement in physiotherapy had a statistically significant relationship with the presence of untoward outcomes in our study (p-value<0.05). Conclusion: Peroneus longus is a strong, robust autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with excellent functional results. Very few patients had untoward effects, and those, too, were of mild intensity. Patients with high body mass index and those not engaging in physiotherapy emerged as high-risk patients for having untoward effects after the surgery. ? 2023, Army Medical College.

Objective: To compare the cortical activity during single-legged stance among CAI, copers, and uninjured control participants and to compare dynamic balance across groups. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Biomechanics laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 22 participants with CAI (median [interquartile range]; age ¬ 34.5 [11.0] years, height ¬ 170.0 [15.8] cm, mass ¬ 67.0 [16.2] kg), 17 copers (age ¬ 27.0 [14.0] years, height ¬ 170.0 [9.5] cm, mass ¬ 66.5 [16.5] kg), and 21 uninjured control participants (age ¬ 25.0 [10.5] years, height ¬ 170.0 [11.0] cm, mass ¬ 64.0 [16.5] kg). Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants performed single-legged stance while cortical activation was tested with functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The peak oxyhemoglobin response of the activated cortex was calculated and compared across groups. The Y-Balance test outcomes and patient-reported outcomes were assessed and compared across groups. Results: The CAI group had worse Y-balance test and patient-reported outcomes than the coper and uninjured control groups. Differences in the peak oxyhemoglobin response were observed for the primary somatosensory cortex (S1; F<inf>2,57</inf> ¬ 4.347, P ¬ .017, h<inf>p</inf>2 ¬ 0.132) and superior temporal gyrus (STG; F<inf>2,57</inf> ¬ 4.548, P ¬ .015, h<inf>p</inf>2 ¬ 0.138). Specifically, copers demonstrated greater activation in S1 and STG than the CAI (d ¬ 0.73, P ¬ .034, and d ¬ 0.69, P ¬ .043, respectively) and uninjured control (d ¬ 0.77, P ¬ .036, and d ¬ 0.88, P ¬ .022, respectively) groups. No differences were found in the cortical activation between CAI and uninjured control participants. Conclusions: Copers displayed greater cortical activation in S1 and STG than CAI and uninjured control participants. Greater activation in S1 and STG suggested a better ability to perceive somatosensory stimuli and may represent a compensatory mechanism that allows copers to maintain good functional ability after the initial severe ankle sprain. ? by the National Athletic Trainers?

908,SC-291,Tensho et al. (2023),2023,Posterior Opening-Wedge Osteotomy for Posterior Tibial Slope Correction of Failed Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"A large posterior tibial slope (PTS) has been widely recognized as a potential risk factor in loosening and retear after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Anterior closed-wedge osteotomy is an effective surgical approach to mitigate this risk factor but presents several disadvantages. We describe in this Technical Note an original PTS correction technique called the posterior open-wedge osteotomy. The posterior surface of the proximal tibia is exposed, and 2 K-wires are inserted anteroposteriorly as osteotomy guides, and one wire is inserted mediolaterally as a hinge blocker. The osteotomy is performed from the posterior side and advanced to the anterior side using a single-bladed reciprocating saw. The slope is corrected by opening the osteotomy plane posteriorly with a spreader. The correction is maintained by inserting the harvested fibula fragments into the open space, and the fixation is completed with a locking plate to ensure firm fixation and allow early rehabilitation. This procedure can be an effective solution for patients with various risk factors for retear of the anterior cruciate ligament graft, including abnormal PTS. ? 2023 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2023.07.059,Arthroscopy Techniques
909,SC-292,Pham et al. (2023),2023,Reference intervals of complete blood count and coagulation tests in Vietnamese pregnant women,"Background: Pregnancy has major effects that make hematology parameters outside ofÿnormal reference ranges. Therefore, we conducted this study to establish reference intervals for Vietnamese pregnant women. Methods: From June 2023 to Augst 2023, blood samples from 879 eligible pregnant women were run on DxH 900 hematology analyzer and ACL TOP 550 coagulation analyzer. The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference intervals. Results: PT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count. The reference intervals for PT (seconds), APTT (seconds), fibrinogen (mg/dL), in the first trimester were 10.30?12.88, 25.40?35.46, 280.28?559.00, in the second trimester were 9.80?11.66, 24.05?33.23, 347.75?593.35, in the third trimester were 9.60?11.40, 23.40?31.80, 330.28?628.56, respectively. The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (? 109/L), RBC (? 1012/L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (? 109/L) in the first trimester were 6.33?15.24, 3.73?5.32, 10.33?13.95, 32.22?42.29, 169.66?413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99?15.55, 3.33?4.98, 9.71?13.17, 30.26?40.07, 172.34?372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22?14.14, 3.54?4.98, 9.80?13.97, 31.11?42.70, 151.30?417.14, respectively. Conclusions: Most established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.

910,SC-293,Rabello et al. (2023),2023,Different neuromuscular parameters are associated with knee abduction and hip adduction angles during functional tasks,"Knee abduction and hip adduction during functional tasks may indicate increased joint injury risk and discriminate between pathological and healthy people. Muscles? neuromuscular variables such as amplitude (EMG<inf>AMP</inf>) and onset (EMG<inf>ONSET</inf>) have been used to explain kinematics. The study aimed to evaluate the correlation between two EMG variables of seven trunk and lower limb muscles and 3D kinematics during two tasks. Eighteen physically-active women participated in the study. The following variables were obtained during single-leg squat and anterior step-down: (i) EMG<inf>AMP</inf> and EMG<inf>ONSET</inf> of fibularis longus (FL), tibialis anterior (TA), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), gluteus medius (GMED), ipsilateral (OB_IL) and contralateral (OB_CL) external obliques and (ii) knee abduction and hip adduction angular displacement (initial angle ? angle at 60ø of knee flexion). Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between kinematic and EMG variables. Greater knee abduction was correlated with delayed TA<inf>ONSET</inf>, GMED<inf>ONSET</inf> and OB_IL<inf>ONSET</inf> during step-down. Greater hip adduction was correlated with lower VM<inf>AMP</inf>, BF<inf>AMP</inf> and delayed VM<inf>ONSET</inf> during step-down. Although task-specific, these results suggest that EMG<inf>ONSET</inf> may influence knee abduction, while both EMG<inf>ONSET</inf> and EMG<inf>AMP</inf> may affect hip adduction. The identification of muscle activation patterns in relation to kinematics may help the development of injury prevention and rehabilitation programs. ? 2023 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2023.102833,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology
911,SC-294,Blasimann et al. (2023),2023,Neuromuscular control in males and females 1ÿyear after an anterior cruciate ligament rupture or reconstruction during stair descent and artificial tibial translation,"Neuromuscular alterations are reported in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) and conservative treatment (copers with ACL deficiency, ACL-C). However, it is unclear whether sex influences neuromuscular control. The objective was to investigate differences in neuromuscular control regarding sex and treatment type one year after ACL rupture in comparison to a group with an intact ACL (ACL-I). Electromyography of vastus medialis (VM) and lateralis, biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) was recorded in ACL-R (N = 38), ACL-C (N = 26), and ACL-I (N = 38) during stair descent and reflex activity by anterior tibial translation while standing. The movements of stair descent were divided into pre-activity, weight-acceptance and push-off phases, reflex activity in pre-activation, short, medium (MLR), and long latency responses (LLR). Normalized root mean squares for each muscle of involved and matched control limb per phase were calculated and analyzed with two-way ANOVA (à = 0.05). During stair descent, neuromuscular differences of BF were significant during push-off only (p = 0.001). Males of ACL-R and ACL-C had higher BF activity compared to ACL-I (p = 0.009, 0.007 respectively). During reflex activity, VM and BF were significantly different between treatment groups for pre-activation (p = 0.013, 0.035 respectively). VM pre-activation of females was higher in ACL-R compared to ACL-C (p = 0.018), and lower in ACL-C compared to ACL-I (p = 0.034). Males of ACL-R showed higher VM and less BF pre-activation (p = 0.025, p = 0.003 respectively) compared to ACL-I. Males of ACL-C had less BF pre-activation compared to ACL-I (p = 0.019). During MLR, intra-group differences in ST were found for treatment (p = 0.011) and females of ACL-R compared to ACL-I (p = 0.015). During LLR, overall intra-group differences in VM were present for treatment (p = 0.034) and in females (ACL-R versus ACL-C (p = 0.015), ACL-I (p = 0.049), respectively). One year after an ACL rupture, neuromuscular alterations persist regardless of treatment and sex. Standard rehabilitation protocols may not be able to restore neuromuscular control. Future research should include long-term follow up and focus on exercises targeting neuromuscular function. ? 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-023-42491-6,Scientific Reports
912,SC-295,Hirai et al. (2023),2023,Anatomical study of type classification and surface area of attachment sites for tibialis anterior tendon,"Background: The purpose of this study was to clarify the attachment types of the tibialis anterior tendon (TAT) in Japanese fixed cadavers and to determine the attachment site area in three dimensions. Methods: We examined 100 feet from 50 Japanese cadavers. The TAT was classified according to differences in the number of fiber bundles as: Type I, with one fiber bundle; Type II, with two fiber bundles; and Type III, with three fiber bundles. The attachment site area of the TAT was measured using a three-dimensional scanner. Results: Cases were Type II in 95% and Type III in 5%, with no cases of Type I identified. In Type II, mean attachment site areas were 85.2 ñ 18.2 mm2 for the medial cuneiform bone (MCB) and 72.4 ñ 19.0 mm2 for the first metatarsal bone (1ÿMB), showing a significantly larger area for MCB than for 1ÿMB. Conclusions: These findings suggest the possibility of ethnic differences in TAT attachment types and suggest that TAT attachments in Japanese individuals are highly likely to be Type II, with rare cases of Type III. Accurate measurement of attachment site areas is possible with appropriate three-dimensional measurements. ? 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1186/s12891-023-06753-8,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders

The study aims to investigate myotonometric parameters and muscle strength of ankle muscles, as well as gait pattern and balance among patients following surgical treatment of pilon fractures. The randomized controlled study will analyze the differences between the patients who will follow a 3-month physical exercise program and will wear customized foot orthoses (i.e., customized orthotic arch support insoles) versus patients who will attend only the physical exercise program. For each group, at least 21 patients will be required. The assessment involves four different testing procedures: myotonometry (anterior tibialis, medial and lateral gastrocnemius, and longus peroneus assessed using MyotonPRO), muscle strength testing (ankle dorsiflexors, plantar flexors, and peroneal muscles assessed using MicroFET2 dynamometer), analysis of gait parameters (using Scheinworks treadmill), and double-leg and single-leg balance tests (using K-Force plate). After 3 months, the assessments will record which of the two treatments (physical exercise program with or without wearing customized foot orthoses) has better outcomes in regaining ankle muscle properties and tone, as well as the restoration of gait and balance. ? 2023 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/life13112187,Life
914,SC-297,Friedman et al. (2023),2023,Perceived ankle instability and cutaneous reflex modulation during gait,"Cutaneous reflex modulation during rhythmic ambulation is an important motor control mechanism to help minimize stumbling following an unexpected perturbation. Previous literature found individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) experience altered reflex patterns compared to healthy controls. Considering CAI is characterized by intermittent feelings of ankle instability, researchers have speculated that these alterations are related to perceived instability. Our purpose was to determine whether variability and magnitude of cutaneous reflex amplitudes can predict perceived instability levels following sural nerve stimulation during gait. Forty subjects walked while receiving random stimulations and reported their perceived instability. Middle latency reflexes among lower leg muscles were calculated using data derived from surface electromyography. Hierarchical logistical regressions revealed a positive relationship between reflex variability of the peroneus longus and lateral gastrocnemius muscles and perceived instability during midstance. This suggests subjects with consistent reflexes following sural nerve stimulation develop a certain level of perceptual expectation resulting in generally lower feelings of ankle instability, while subjects with more variable motor outputs perceive greater instability at the supraspinal level. Cutaneous reflex variability during stance may be an important objective outcome measure to monitor neuromuscular recovery throughout a rehabilitation or as a potential predictor of future lateral ankle sprains. ? 2023 The Authors.

With the development of arthroscopic technology, the treatment options for irreparable massive rotator cuff tears (IMRCTs) have gradually increased, but postoperatively, these options are prone to graft retears, reoperations, infections, revision surgical procedures, and so on. On the basis of studies on the balance of the force couples of the rotator cuff, more scholars believe that when addressing IMRCTs, attention should be paid to the reconstruction of the force couples of the rotator cuff; hence, we developed the superior fulcrum reconstruction technique. This article describes an alternative approach to IMRCT repair with superior fulcrum reconstruction using autologous ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon. ? 2023 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2023.07.024,Arthroscopy Techniques
916,SC-299,Reisdorf et al. (2023),2023,Carbodiimide-Derivatized Synovial Fluid for Tendon Graft Coating Improves Long-Term Functional Outcomes of Flexor Tendon Reconstruction,"Background: Flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon injury is common in hand trauma, and flexor tendon reconstruction is one of the most challenging procedures in hand surgery because of severe adhesion that exceeds 25% and hinders hand function. The surface properties of a graft from extrasynovial tendons are inferior to those of the native intrasynovial FDP tendons, which has been reported as one of the major causations. Improved surface gliding ability of the extrasynovial graft is needed. Thus, this study used carbodiimide-derivatized synovial fluid and gelatin (cd-SF-gel) to modify the surface of the graft, thus improving functional outcomes using a dog in vivo model. Methods: Forty FDP tendons from the second and fifth digits of 20 adult women underwent reconstruction with a peroneus longus (PL) autograft after creation of a tendon repair failure model for 6 weeks. Graft tendons were either coated with cd-SF-gel (n = 20) or not. Animals were euthanized 24 weeks after reconstruction, and digits were collected after the animals were euthanized for biomechanical and histologic analyses. Results: Adhesion score (cd-SF-gel, 3.15 ñ 1.53; control, 5 ñ 1.26; P < 0.00017), normalized work of flexion (cd-SF-gel, 0.47 ñ 0.28 N-mm/degree; control, 1.4 ñ 1.45 N-mm/degree; P < 0.014), and distal interphalangeal joint motion (cd-SF-gel, 17.63 ñ 6.77 degrees; control, 7.07 ñ 12.99 degrees; P < 0.0015) in treated grafts all showed significant differences compared with nontreated grafts. However, there was no significant difference in repair conjunction strength between the two groups. Conclusion: Autograft tendon surface modification with cd-SF-gel improves tendon gliding ability, reduces adhesion formation, and enhances digit function without interfering with graft-host healing. Clinical Relevance Statement: The authors demonstrate a clinically relevant and translational technology by using the patient's own synovial fluid to ""synovialize"" an autologous extrasynovial tendon graft to improve functional outcomes following flexor tendon reconstruction. ? 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

917,SC-300,Huddleston et al. (2023),2023,PROMIS physical function and pain perform poorly psychometrically in patients undergoing medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the validity, floor and ceiling effects, and dimensionality of PROMIS Physical Function (PF) and Pain compared to legacy patient reported outcome (PRO) measures in patients undergoing medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction. Methods: Patients who underwent MPFL reconstruction between 2018 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperatively, patients completed the IKDC, VR-12, Kujala, SF-12, KOOS JR, PROMIS PF and Pain surveys. Inter-survey convergence was assessed with Spearman correlations. Psychometric analysis included investigations of inter-survey convergent validity, intra-survey floor and ceiling effects, and Rasch analyses with person?item fit and iterative question elimination model fit testing. Results: A total of 76 patients (mean age: 22.6 ñ 8.4ÿyears) who completed preoperative surveys were included (compliance: 91.7?96.2%). Preoperatively, age was significantly associated with both PROMIS PF (coefficient: ? 0.291, P = 0.005) and Pain scores (coefficient: 0.294, P = 0.002). PROMIS PF had a Very Good correlation with IKDC and PROMIS Pain had a Very Good correlation with KOOS JR. Other correlations ranged from Poor to Good. No significant floor or ceiling effects were observed for any PRO. On iterative question elimination Rasch modelling, only two questions from PROMIS PF remained after 6 rounds of elimination while PROMIS Pain had no questions remaining after 3 rounds of elimination. Conclusion: Preoperative PROMIS PF and Pain provided only Fair to Good correlations with most legacy PROs. Although no significant floor and ceiling effects were observed, PROMIS PF and Pain did not perform well psychometrically in this population of patients undergoing MPFL reconstruction. These results suggest PROMIS questionnaires should be used with caution in this population, especially if used in isolation, when discussing clinical expectations with patients. The authors recommend continued use of legacy PROs specific to assessment of patellar instability and function that have established validity in patellar instability populations.

(2023),2023,Complications of peroneus longus tendon harvesting: a retrospective review of 82 cases,"Objective: Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has become a reliable autologous graft option for various ligament reconstructions. But there are potential risks and complications associated with its use as a graft. This retrospective study aimed to examine the complications and donor site morbidity following PLT harvesting. Patients and methods: A retrospective review was performed on an institutional digital patient database, and all patients who underwent ligament reconstruction using PLT autograft were identified. Intraoperative, early, and late complications were reviewed using digital patient notes and patients underwent a complete physical examination during their final follow-up. Ankle function was assessed using the AOFAS score, and manual ankle muscle testing was performed on both sides. Sural nerve iatrogenic injury was evaluated with a dermatomal light touch examination. Cosmetic satisfaction due to incision scar and footwear complaints were also assessed. Results: 82 patients (74 male, eight female) with a mean age of 31.9 ñ 10.4ÿyears (range, 16?66) were included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up time was 46.6 ñ 30.3ÿmonths (range, 6?109). The mean AOFAS score for the donor side was 98.7 ñ 3.3 (range, 87?100), and the contralateral side score was 100, with manual muscle testing graded as 5 in all movements and similar to the contralateral side. Fifteen patients (18.3%) had hypoesthesia over the dorsolateral aspect of the foot distal to the incision scar, two patients (2.4%) had hyperalgesia over the distal incision scar, and one patient (1.2%) had mild ankle instability. There were two cases (2.4%) of compartment syndrome, both of which were treated with fasciotomy and had complete regression of symptoms after 5 days. One patient (1.2%) had a transient peroneal nerve injury and foot drop that resolved in the sixth month. Conclusions: The results of this retrospective study suggest that harvesting the PLT is associated with a high rate of complications and donor site morbidity. The most common complication was hypoesthesia around the lateral side of the foot, although the ankle functions were not affected significantly. Two cases of compartment syndrome and one transient peroneal nerve injury were observed. Care should be taken while harvesting PLT autograft, and it should be kept in mind that peroneal nerve injury might occur.

921,SC-304,Islam et al. (2023),2023,Anthropometry in predicting Semitendinosus and Gracilis graft diameter for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction among the Bengali population,"Semitendinosus and Gracilis autografts are commonly used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However, its main drawback is individual variation in the tendon diameter. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the anthropometric measurements for the prediction of Semitendinosus and Gracilis combined (quadrupled) strands graft diameter in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction among the Bengali population. Sixty consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between July 2019 to June 2020 were observed in this cross-sectional study. In all cases, the doubled (2 strands) Gracilis and Semitendinosus tendons were combined to get the final quadrupled (combined 4 strands) graft for use. Anthropometries such as body mass index (BMI), body weight, and height were recorded preoperatively and quadrupled combined tendon diameter was measured at the operating theater. The relationship between these parameters was statistically determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and scatter diagrams were plotted. Among the study subjects, most (54) were male, and the mean age of all subjects was 24 ñ 6.92 years. The average graft diameter was 7.20 ñ 0.76 mm. Correlations between the mean graft diameter with BMI (r = 0.018, and P = .891), body height (r = 0.011 and P = .933), and weight (r = 0.028 and P = .832) were not significant. Scatter diagrams also showed that the variables were not correlated. Anthropometries like BMI, body weight, or body height cannot be used in predicting Semitendinosus and Gracilis tendon graft diameter for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction among the Bengali population. ? 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

922,SC-305,Liu et al. (2023),2023,Therapeutic effect on transposition of peroneal longus tendon in reconstruction of long segment defect of chronic Achilles tendon rupture; ??????????????????????,"Objective To explore the therapeutic effect on transposition of peroneal longus tendon in reconstruction of long segment defects of chronic Achilles tendon. Methods From November 2013 to November 2018, 17 patients with long segment defects of chronic Achilles tendon(greater than 5.0 cm of defect) were admitted in the Department of Trauma and Micro-orthopaedics of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. The patients were 14 males and 3 females, aged 19-55 years old, with an average of 34.7 years old. Eleven patients had defects on left Achilles tendon and 6 on the right. The chronic defects lasted over 1-12 months with an average of 3.8 months. The broken ends of the Achilles tendon located at 0-5.0 cm from the insertion point. The defects were at 5.0-9.0 cm in length, after debridement of the broken ends. After thoroughly debridement of the scar tissue over the broken end of an Achilles tendon, an autologous peroneal tendon transposition was performed for reconstruction of an Achilles tendon. Postoperative follow-ups were conducted to observe wound healing and complications. Arner Lindholm score was employed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy before surgery and at the final follow-up. Ankle-hindfoot score of American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society(AOFAS) and Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score(ATRS) were used to evaluate functional recovery. At the final follow-up, heel raise of single affected foot and the maximum circumference of both calves were observed, gait analyses for plantar stress assessment as well as review of ankle CT and MRI scans were conducted for assessment of therapeutic efficacy. Using t test in SPSS 22.0 software to compare preoperative and postoperative AOFAS and ATRS scores, P<0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference. Results Wounds healed in one stage, except 1 diabetic patient who had haematoma in the wound after surgery and healed after debridement combined with VSD treatment. All the 17 patients had completed the postoperative follow-up that lasted for 24-48 months, with an average of 33 months. According to Arner Lindholm score for efficacy evaluation, 11 patients were in excellent and 6 in good. The postoperative AOFAS scores increased from 62.94 ñ 6.51 before surgery to 93.71 ñ 6.15 after the surgery. ATRS increased from 29.00 ñ 3.54 before surgery to 92.29 ñ 3.02 after the surgery, and the score difference between before and after surgery was staistically significant (P<0.05). No patient experienced a complication such as Achilles tendon rupture, wound infection or nerve injury. During follow-up, ankle functions recovered well, valgus was found powerful as well as heel raise on single foot. The circumference of the affected calf was smaller than that of the healthy side by no more than 1.5 cm. Gait analysis showed balanced distribution of plantar stress. No corpus callosum formation was found in both of the affected and the healthy feet. No obvious sign of osteoarthritis of ankle showed review in CT scans. Ankle MRI scans showed good continuity of the reconstructed Achilles tendons, which become significantly thicker after the surgery. Conclusion The transposition of the long peroneal tendon is a relatively simple and effective surgical technique for reconstruction of a chronic Achilles tendon rupture or defect in a longer length or a rupture at the insertion point. ? 2023 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

923,SC-306,Stojanovic et al. (2023),2023,Vegetation Greenness Sensitivity to Precipitation and Its Oceanic and Terrestrial Component in Selected Biomes and Ecoregions of the World,"In this study, we conducted a global assessment of the sensitivity of vegetation greenness (VGS) to precipitation and to the estimated Lagrangian precipitation time series of oceanic (PLO) and terrestrial (PLT) origin. The study was carried out for terrestrial ecosystems consisting of 9 biomes and 139 ecoregions during the period of 2001?2018. This analysis aimed to diagnose the vegetative response of vegetation to the dominant component of precipitation, which is of particular interest considering the hydroclimatic characteristics of each ecoregion, climate variability, and changes in the origin of precipitation that may occur in the context of climate change. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as an indicator of vegetation greenness. Without consideration of semi-arid and arid regions and removing the role of temperature and radiation, the results show the maximum VGS to precipitation in boreal high-latitude ecoregions that belong to boreal forest/taiga: temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands. Few ecoregions, mainly in the Amazon basin, show a negative sensitivity. We also found that vegetation greenness is generally more sensitive to the component that contributes the least to precipitation and is less stable throughout the year. Therefore, most vegetation greenness in Europe is sensitive to changes in PLT and less to PLO. In contrast, the boreal forest/taiga in northeast Asia and North America is more sensitive to changes in PLO. Finally, in most South American and African ecoregions, where PLT is crucial, the vegetation is more sensitive to PLO, whereas the contrast occurs in the northern and eastern ecoregions of Australia. ? 2023 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/rs15194706,Remote Sensing
924,SC-307,Azam et al. (2023),2023,Surgical Management of Chronic Achilles Tendon Ruptures: A Systematic Review and Proposed Treatment Algorithm,"Background: As no evidence-based treatment guidelines exist for chronic Achilles tendon rupture (CATR), a systematic review of the literature was performed to compare the different treatment options and recommend a literature-based algorithm. Methods: In June 2022, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically reviewed based on the PRISMA guidelines. The level of evidence (LOE) and quality of evidence were evaluated, and statistics on clinical outcomes and complications were calculated. Results: Twenty-seven studies with 614 patients were included. Three studies were LOE III and 25 studies were LOE IV. The mean Achilles tendon rupture score improved from a preoperative weighted mean of 38.8 ñ 12.4 to a postoperative score 90.6 ñ 4.7. The overall complication rate was 11.4%. Single techniques were used in 23 studies and dual techniques were used in 5 studies. The FHL tendon transfer was the most frequently used technique. We devised an algorithmic approach based on time from injury to surgical intervention and the length of the gap between the tendon stumps: >3 months: FHL transfer; <3 months (a) gap <2 cm, end-to-end repair; (b) gap 2 to 5 cm, gastrocnemius transfer, (c) gap >5 cm, semitendinosus autograft. Conclusion: Surgical management of CATR produced improvements in patient-reported outcome scores at midterm follow up, but a high complication rate (11.4%) was noted. Our proposed treatment algorithm may assist in shared decision making for this complex problem. ? The Author(s) 2023.",Scopus,10.1177/24730114231200491,Foot and Ankle Orthopaedics
925,SC-308,Ripoll et al. (2023),2023,Comparison Between Continuous and Separate Grafts for ALL Reconstruction When Combined With ACL Reconstruction: A Retrospective Cohort Study From the SANTI Study Group,"Background: While various techniques have been described to augment the anterolateral side of the knee, such as lateral extra-articular tenodesis and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction (ALLR), it is unclear how they affect clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the results of 2 ALLR techniques for combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)/ALL reconstruction. Hypothesis: The graft rupture rate, complications, and patient-reported outcomes are similar between a reconstruction technique using a continuous gracilis graft (CG) and single femoral tunnel for ACL/ALL reconstruction, and one using a separate gracilis graft (SG) and independent femoral tunnels. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively at 2 hospitals was conducted: one in which a CG is preferred when performing combined ACL/ALL reconstruction and the other in which an SG is preferred. The medical records at these 2 hospitals were searched to identify ACL-deficient patients who had undergone ACL/ALL reconstruction between 2015 and 2020. Eligible patients were between 18 and 60 years of age, had the reconstruction surgery done within 24 months of the injury, and had ò2 years of follow-up. The eligible patients were contacted to gather outcomes, or their outcomes were collected in person during their last follow-up visit. Outcomes evaluated included graft rupture rate, complication rate, and Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) scores. Preoperative and intraoperative data were also evaluated. Results: A total of 237 patients were available for analysis in the GC group and 178 in the SG group with a mean follow-up of 3 years (CG: SD, 9.6 months; SG: SD, 8.1 months). The authors found a low rate of graft rupture (CG: 3.4%; SG: 2.8%; P =.785) and no difference between techniques. The complication rate was 6% in the CG group, while it was 10% in the SG group (P =.112). The mean value of the IKDC-SKF was similar between techniques (CG: 88.1; SG: 87.9; P =.267), and the mean Lysholm score was excellent in both sets of patients (CG: 90.0; SG: 92.4; P <.001). Conclusion: This study found little to no difference in the graft rupture rate, complication rate, and functional knee scores when using a CG or SG for ALLR during combined ACL/ALL reconstruction. Both techniques are equivalent and can be used for an anterolateral augmentation procedure in combination with ACL reconstruction. ? 2023 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465231197353,American Journal of Sports Medicine
926,SC-309,Maffulli et al. (2023),2023,Free tendon grafts for surgical management of chronic tears of the main body of the Achilles tendon: a systematic review,"Purpose: After four weeks from injury, tears of the Achilles tendon are considered chronic. Their management is challenging, and the use of a graft is suggested when the gap between proximal and distal stumps is greater than 6ÿcm. The present study systematically reviews the outcome of free tendon grafts in chronic ruptures of the Achilles tendon, evaluating clinical outcomes, complications and return to sport. Methods: The present study was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases were accessed in February 2023. All the published clinical studies reporting clinical outcome, return to sport and complications of free tendon grafts used the treatment of chronic rupture of the midportion of the Achilles Tendon were accessed. The mean CMS (Coleman Methodology Score) of 65.7 suggested an overall good quality of the available published articles, attesting to the low risk of bias. Results: Data from 22 articles (368 patients with a mean age of 47ÿyears) were retrieved. The average time from rupture to surgery was 25.1ÿweek. At last follow-up, the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Surgery) and ATRS (Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score) scores improved of 33.8 (P = 0.0004), and 45.1 points (P = 0.0001) respectively. Return to activity was reported in 105 patients, and 82 (78.1%) had no activity limitations, while 19 (18.1%) had limited recreational but not daily activity limitations, and 4 (3.8%) reported limitations in daily activities. Return to sport data was reported in six studies, and 45 of 93 (48.4%) patients returned to sport at an average of 22.6ÿweeks. Conclusion: In chronic tears of the Achilles tendon, with a gap of at least 6ÿcm, free tendon grafts allow predictable return to sport and acceptable recovery function.

927,SC-310,Cemin et al. (2023),2023,A single session of hip abductors resistance exercise until failure changes shank muscle activation during landing tasks,"BACKGROUND: Weakness in the hip abductors can lead to lower limb misalignment and an elevated risk of injury. This can result in compensatory mechanisms at the ankle to maintain stability. AIM: To verify the effects of a single session of hip abductors resistance exercise until failure on the foot pronation and EMG amplitude of shank muscles (peroneus longus-PL; tibialis anterior-TA) during landing tasks. METHOD: Seventeen participants completed single-leg and double-leg landings both before and after a single session of hip abductors resistance exercise until failure. The exercise consisted of four sets of 10 repetitions maximum, with a 2-minute rest interval between each set. Measurements of PL and TA EMG amplitude and degree of foot pronation were performed during landings. RESULTS: We observed a greater degree of supination of the foot during single-leg compared to double-leg landing (p=0.006), without effect of exercise. Regarding TA EMG amplitude, there was no exercise effect (p=0.951), with a higher amplitude observed in double-leg compared to single-leg landing (p=0.001). EMG amplitude of PL was higher during single-leg compared to double-leg landing (p=0.003) and the exercise significantly reduced its activation in both tasks (p=0.032). CONCLUSION: Single-leg and double-leg landings exhibited variations in mechanics and activation patterns of the distal muscles. Following a single session of hip abductors resistance exercise until failure, there was a reduction in PL activation during landing tasks. This suggests that there were neuromuscular compensations occurring distally due to alterations in the hip abductor muscles. ? 2023 Cemin, Chaffe, Nodari, Borges, Fitarelli, Bianchesse, J£nior and Rodrigues and BJMB.",Scopus,10.20338/bjmb.v17i5.370,Brazilian Journal of Motor Behavior

(2023),2023,Outcome of Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus and Bone?Patellar Tendon?Bone Autografts: A Clinical Comparative Study,"Background: The aim of this study is to compare the mid-term outcomes of primary tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction via the use of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and bone?patellar tendon?bone (BPTB) autografts. Methods: 53 patients (group 1) received ACL reconstruction via BPTB, whereas 55 patients (group 2) received arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft. Results: In group 1, the mean preoperative and postoperative scores on the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire (LKQ) scale resulted in 69.2 ñ 10.7 points and ?92.2 ñ 6.4 points, respectively. The average preoperative and postoperative value on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale was 68.2 ñ 10.6% and ?90.1 ñ 9.5%, respectively. For KT-1000, according to the results of surgical treatment, it is ?3.7 ñ 1.4 mm, and for the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOSAF) it is ?95.3 ñ 4.5%. The autograft ruptured within 2 years after operation in 4 of 50 patients. In group 2, the mean score on the LKQ scale before the operation was 70.2 ñ 11.6 points, after ?94.3 ñ 0.5 points. The average value on the IKDC scale before surgery was 68.6 ñ 8.7%, after ?91.5 ñ 8.2%. KT-1000 ?3.4 ñ 1.2 mm. Conclusion: The results in both groups can be assessed as good; peroneus longus muscle tendon autograft is an alternative graft for the primary reconstruction of ACL, preserving the dynamic stabilizers of the knee and has no effect on the formation of flat feet and other disease in the postoperative period. ? 2023 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/surgeries4030043,Surgeries (Switzerland)
929,SC-312,Xu et al. (2023),2023,Platelet-Derived Exosomes Alleviate Knee Osteoarthritis by Attenuating Cartilage Degeneration and Subchondral Bone Loss,"Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic degenerative joint disease among the aged population. However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. Purpose: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1? stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro?computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Results: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo. Clinical Relevance: Our study illustrated that the administered Plt-exos could alleviate knee OA by attenuating cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss, possibly serving as a novel promising treatment for OA in the future. ? 2023 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465231188122,American Journal of Sports Medicine

Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using four-strand hamstring tendon grafts (hamstring group), autologous hamstrings augmented with the LARS (LARS group), or synthetic meshwork of LARS (meshwork group) were selected in this prospective randomized clinical study. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were obtained preoperatively; at 6, 12, and 18ÿmonths postoperatively; and at final follow-up between 3 and 8ÿyears. Second-look arthroscopic findings were used to evaluate graft morphology based on graft tension, graft tear, and synovial coverage. Results: A total of 141 consecutive patients underwent ACL reconstruction, 47 patients in each group, and 21 patients were lost to follow-up during the study period. At the 6-month follow-up, the IKDC scores and Lysholm scores were significantly better in the LARS group (P < 0.05). At the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, the KOS-ADLS, KOOS-activities of daily living and quality of life, NSARS scores, GRC scores, Tegner scores, and ACL-RSI scores were significantly better in the LARS group (P < 0.05). For the LARS group, hamstring group, and meshwork group, the cumulative failure rates were 8.5%, 12.8%, and 4.3%, respectively. Malposition of the femoral tunnel was significantly associated with cumulative failure (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in other outcomes at any other time, including radiographic and arthroscopic outcomes. Conclusions: ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring augmented with LARS resulted in significantly better clinical scores with a faster return to sports and comparative side-to-side differences in graft laxity by 6 and 12ÿmonths follow-up. Despite these findings, no statistically significant differences were seen among the three patient groups in terms of objective outcomes and clinical scores at the 18-month, 3-year and 8-year follow-ups. Additionally, a malpositioned femoral tunnel was associated with graft failure. ? 2023, Indian Orthopaedics Association.",Scopus,10.1007/s43465-023-00956-w,Indian Journal of Orthopaedics
931,SC-314,Shadegani et al. (2023),2023,Comparison of effects of Mulligan taping and Kinesio taping on ankle neuromuscular control in response to a sudden inversion perturbation in individuals with chronic ankle instability,"Objectives: This study was aimed to compare the effects of Mulligan taping (MT) with Kinesio taping (KT) and the un-taped ankle on neuromuscular control during a sudden inversion perturbation in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Design: Randomized, single blind cross-over. Setting: Biomechanics lab. Participants: 16 individuals with chronic ankle instability. Main outcome measures: The outcome measures were the onset time and magnitude of short (SLR) and medium latency response (MLR) for peroneus brevis (PB), peroneus longus (PL), tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus (SOL) muscles and the TA/P and SOL/TA antagonist co-activation. Results: In the groups of KT and MT, the onset time was significantly decreased at post-taping compared to pre-taping, such that for the onset time of PB MLR, the groups of KT and MT had an earlier onset time than the un-taped group. For the magnitude of TA SLR and PB MLR, groups exhibited different behaviors. In the KT group, the magnitude was significantly increased post-taping, however, in the MT group, it was decreased. Regarding the TA/P and SOL/TA co-activation, the groups of KT and MT showed significant changes post-taping. Conclusion: This study suggests that KT and MT significantly affect neuromuscular control in response to a sudden perturbation in individuals with CAI, although the behavior of KT and MT appears to be somewhat different from each other. ? 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2023.07.004,Physical Therapy in Sport

Methods: This prospective case series included 19 patients with a posterolateral corner injury. The posterolateral corner was reconstructed using a modified anatomical technique that utilized adjustable suspensory fixation on the tibial side. Patients were evaluated subjectively using the international knee documentation form (IKDC), Lysholm, and Tegner activity scales and objectively by measuring the tibial external rotation angle, knee hyperextension, and lateral joint line opening on stress varus radiographs before and after surgery. The patients were followed-up for a minimum of 2ÿyears. Results: Both IKDC and Lysholm knee scores significantly improved from 49 and 53 preoperatively to 77 and 81 postoperatively, respectively. The tibial external rotation angle and knee hyperextension showed significant reduction to normal values at the final follow-up. However, the lateral joint line opening measured on the varus stress radiograph remained larger than the contralateral normal knee. Conclusion: Posterolateral corner reconstruction with a hamstring autograft using a modified anatomical reconstruction technique significantly improved both the subjective patient scores and objective knee stability. However, the varus stability was not completely restored compared with the uninjured knee.

(2023),2023,"The role of hip abductor strength and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion on proximal, local and distal muscle activation during single-leg squat in patellofemoral pain women: an all-encompassing lower limb approach","Purpose: Lower limb alignment during weight-bearing tasks have been associated with ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (DF ROM) and hip abductors muscles' strength. It remains unclear which differences exist on kinematics and proximal, local and distal muscle activation between patellofemoral pain (PFP) and asymptomatic people after controlling the analysis by these measures. Methods: Thirty women (PFP, n = 15 [age 26.33 ñ 4.18ÿyears; body mass index: 24.51 ñ 3.61ÿkg/m2]; asymptomatic?CG, n = 15 [age: 29 ñ 5.23ÿyears; body mass index: 23.12 ñ 3.31ÿkg/m2]) completed the following tests: (i) passive ankle DF ROM and (ii) hip abductor isometric strength. After that, the participants performed five repetitions of single-leg squat. Frontal plane kinematics (using dynamic valgus index?DVI) and normalized EMG amplitude of the trunk [External Oblique (EO)], hip [Gluteus Medius (GMed) and Tensor Fascia Latae (TFL)], knee [Vastus Lateralis (VL), Rectus Femoris (RF), Vastus Medialis (VM)] and ankle/foot [Fibularis Longus (FIB) and Tibialis Anterior (TA)] were obtained during squat and compared between groups. Results: PFP had a lower TA EMG amplitude (?54.19%; p = 0.002). After controlling the analysis by DF ROM and hip abductor strength, PFP had: (i) lower GMed EMG amplitude (?17.42%; p = 0.041); (ii) lower FIB EMG amplitude (?46.80%; p = 0.029); (iii) lower TA EMG amplitude (?53.42%; p = 0.004). Conclusions: Ankle DF-ROM and hip abductor strength seems to influence on lower proximal and distal EMG amplitude observed during the single-leg squat in women with PFP. Future studies needs to consider an all-encompassing lower limb approach to better understand the sensorimotor control which contributes to lower limb alignment in PFP people. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s11332-022-00980-7,Sport Sciences for Health

(2023),2023,Injury Patterns in Posterolateral Corner Knee Injury,"Background: Posterolateral corner (PLC) knee injuries associated with different injury mechanisms are not well known. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study sought to assess the patterns of associated injuries in the setting of PLC injury. The hypothesis was that there are recognizable injury patterns in PLC injuries that may correlate with injury mechanism. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Patients who sustained a multiligament knee injury were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who sustained an acute grade 3 PLC injury and underwent surgery were enrolled in this study. A description of the PLC injury (location of the injury of the fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon, and/or popliteofibular ligament) and reported concomitant injuries (biceps femoris tendon or meniscal tears, cartilage pathology and/or peroneal nerve palsy, or bone bruises) were collected and classified based on intraoperative and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Results: Of 135 patients reviewed, 83 did not have PLC involvement and 13 were excluded due to insufficient MRI scans available. Thus, 39 patients were included in this study. For both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)?PLC and ACL?posterior cruciate ligament?PLC injury patterns, the most frequent injury pattern entailed a bone bruise of the anteromedial (AM) femur and tibia, an FCL tear from the fibular head, the popliteus tendon avulsed off the femur, a biceps femoris tendon torn off the fibular head, and a common peroneal nerve palsy. Conversely, when no bone bruise occurred on the AM femur and tibia, the FCL was injured on the femoral side and the popliteus tendon, biceps femoris, and peroneal nerve were not injured. Conclusion: AM bone bruise was associated with a peroneal nerve injury in almost half of the patients, and peroneal nerve injury was not seen if there was no AM bone bruise. ?

While allograft meniscal transplantation is the preferred method for treating meniscal deficiency, its high cost and various legal regulations have limited its widespread use. Autologous tendon grafts have been proposed as a substitute for allograft meniscus transplantation, but their initial results were poor, leading to little progress in this area. However, recent animal experiments and clinical studies have demonstrated promising results in using autologous tendon grafts for meniscal transplantation, including improvements in pain and quality of life for patients. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of segmental meniscal reconstruction using autologous tendon grafts, but it could potentially lead to more accessible and cost-effective treatment options for patients with meniscal deficiency. ? 2023 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/medicina59081497,Medicina (Lithuania)

(2023),2023,Task-related differences in peroneus longus muscle fiber conduction velocity,"It has been identified that the peroneus longus presents a regional activity. Specifically, a greater activation of the anterior and posterior compartments has been observed during eversion, whereas a lower activation of the posterior compartment has been reported during plantarflexion. In addition to myoelectrical amplitude, motor unit recruitment can be inferred indirectly from muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV). However, there are few reports of MFCV of the regions that make up a muscle, and even less, MFCV of the peroneus longus compartments. This study aimed to analyze the MFCV of peroneus longus compartments during eversion and plantarflexion. Twenty-one healthy individuals were assessed. High-density surface electromyography was recorded from the peroneus longus during eversion and plantarflexion at 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction. The posterior compartment presented a lower MFCV than the anterior compartment during plantarflexion, and both compartments did not show differences in MFCV during eversion; however, the posterior compartment showed an increase in MFCV during eversion compared to plantarflexion. Differences observed in the MFCV of the peroneus longus compartments could support a regional activation strategy and, to some extent, explain different motor unit recruitment strategies of the peroneus longus during ankle movements. ? 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2023.102795,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology
938,SC-321,Luo et al. (2023),2023,Preoperative ultrasound can accurately predict the diameter of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon autografts,"Purpose: This study aimed to determine the correlation between the intraoperative diameter of double-stranded peroneus longus tendon (2PLT) and length of the PLT autograft and preoperative ultrasound (US) measurements, as well as radiographic and anthropometric measurements. The hypothesis was that US can accurately predict the diameter of 2PLT autografts during operation. Methods: Twenty-six patients underwent ligament reconstruction with 2PLT autografts were included. Preoperative US was used to calculate the in situ PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) at seven levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10ÿcm proximal to the harvest start point). Femoral width, notch width, notch height, maximum patellar length, and patellar tendon length were determined on preoperative radiographs. Intraoperative measurements of PLT were made, including all fiber lengths of PLT and diameters of 2PLT using sizing tubes calibrated to 0.5ÿmm. Results: CSA at 1ÿcm proximal to the harvest site had the highest correlation with the diameter of 2PLT (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Calf length had the highest correlation with PLT length (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The diameter of the 2PLT autografts could be predicted by the following formula: 4.6 + 0.2 ? [sonographic CSA of PLT at 1ÿcm level]; the length of PLT could be predicted by the following formula: 5.6 + 0.5 ? Calf length. Conclusion: The diameter of 2PLT and length of PLT autografts can be accurately predicted by preoperative US and calf length measurements, respectively. Accurate preoperative prediction of the diameter and length of autologous grafts can provide the most suitable and individualized graft for patients.

A standard definition of failure for the surgical treatment of ankle instability has not been established by clinicians and researchers. Purpose: To identify the definitions of ankle instability treatment failure that are currently in the literature and to work toward the standardization of the definition. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted to identify clinical studies that included patients who underwent surgical treatment for LAI and included information about surgical failure. Studies with level of evidence 1 to 4 were included in this review. Animal studies, biomechanical studies, cadaveric studies, review articles, and expert opinions were excluded. The included studies were then reviewed for definitions of failure of any surgical procedure that was performed to correct LAI. Results: Of the 1200 studies found, 3.5% (42/1200) published between 1984 and 2021 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. After reviewing the data, we found numerous definitions were reported in the literature for LAI surgical failure. The most common was recurrent instability (40% [17/42]), followed by rerupture (19% [8/42]). For the original surgical procedure, the anatomic Brostr”m-Gould technique was used most frequently (57% [24/42]). The failure rate of the Brostr”m-Gould technique ranged from 1.1% to 45.2% depending on the definition of failure. Conclusion: There were multiple definitions of failure for the surgical treatment of LAI, which is one of the reasons why the rate of failure can vary greatly. The literature would benefit greatly from the standardization of the definition of ankle instability treatment failure. This definition should include specific, objective physical examination findings that eliminate the ambiguity surrounding failure. ? 2023 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465231153165,American Journal of Sports Medicine
940,SC-323,Lee et al. (2023),2023,Disrupted vision impairs force steadiness and accuracy in chronic ankle instability patients,"The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effect of visual disruption on submaximal force steadiness and accuracy among three groups including chronic ankle instability (CAI) patients, lateral ankle sprain copers, and healthy controls. Twentyÿpatients with CAI, 20 copers, and 20 matched-healthy controls volunteered to participate in the study. Submaximal force steadiness and accuracy for evertors, invertors, and hip abductors (10% and 20% of their maximal voluntary isometric contraction) were measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. All groups performed the tasks with and without stroboscopic glasses. The CAI group showed worse steadiness and accuracy in evertors with visual disruption compared to nonvisual disruption (p < 0.0001 and = 0.02, respectively). Relative to the control group, the CAI group showed worse force steadiness and accuracy in evertors (p < 0.0001, both), worse force accuracy in hip abductors (p = 0.02), and the coper group also showed worse accuracy in evertors (p = 0.02). Individuals with CAI demonstrated impaired force steadiness and accuracy in evertors and hip abductors compared to healthy controls. In addition, they tended to rely more on visual feedback during the force steadiness task than copers and healthy controls. ? 2023 Orthopaedic Research Society.

941,SC-324,Vogt et al. (2023),2023,Anatomical acromioclavicular joint stabilization with chemically sterilized tendon allografts: A retrospective study,"Background: The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze whether chemically sterilized tendon allografts perform as well as other non-sterilized allografts and autografts as described in the literature for anatomical acromioclavicular joint stabilization for the treatment of Rockwood III?V. Allografts are still described as a factor for higher re-rupture rates. Methods: Retrospective data were collected from 21 acromioclavicular joint stabilizations performed by a single surgeon and performed between 2011 and 2014 using sterilized semitendinosus allografts. The primary endpoints were re-rupture and complication rates. Secondary endpoints were AC-joint stability, pain level, return to work and sport and the range of motion. Results: No re-ruptures occurred during the mean follow-up time of 33 months. Zero complications occurred directly after surgery, but three complications later than three weeks after surgery. All cases resolved without further surgery. After surgery, stability significantly improved for all patients. Post-surgery, 19 patients had stable acromioclavicular joints and only two patients showed minor instabilities. Range of motion returned to the range of the healthy shoulders for all patients. Conclusion: Chemically sterilized semitendinosus allograft use for anatomic AC-joint stabilization is equivalent to the use of other allografts or autografts and required no hardware removal. No donor age or graft size dependence was observed, due to zero re-ruptures. ? The Author(s) 2022.",Scopus,10.1177/17585732221136863,Shoulder and Elbow

A narrative case report,"Objectives: Lateral ankle sprains involving the ATFL and CFL are common injuries in football with a high recurrence rate. There is a lack of research to guide post-operative rehabilitation of football players following lateral ligament ankle reconstructive surgery. This narrative case report discusses the management of a lateral ligament reconstruction in a male professional football player. Methods: A 25-year-old professional footballer underwent a lateral ankle reconstruction following recurrent lateral ankle sprains leading to an unstable ankle. Results: Following 11-weeks of rehabilitation the player was cleared to return to full-contact training. The player competed in his first competitive match 13-weeks post-injury and completed a 6-month full-training block, without episodes of pain or instability. Conclusion: This case report illustrates the rehabilitation process of a football player following a lateral ankle ligament reconstruction within a timeframe expected in elite sport. ? 2023 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2023.05.004,Physical Therapy in Sport
943,SC-326,Han et al. (2023),2023,Effect of varied dorsiflexion range of motion on landing biomechanics in chronic ankle instability,"Background: Limited dorsiflexion range of motion (DFROM) is a risk factor for lateral ankle sprain. However, varied DFROM exists within the chronic ankle instability (CAI) population, and how the variability may influence altered movement patterns during landing is unclear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify different movement strategies during maximal jump landing/cutting among CAI patients classified by varied DFROM. Methods: One hundred CAI subjects were classified into 3 subgroups based on their DFROM, measured by the weight-bearing lunge test: a Hypo- (ó40ø), Normal- (40?50ø), and Hyper-DFROM group (ò50ø). Participants completed five trials of maximal jump landing/cutting. Lower extremity joint angles and EMG activation of seven muscles were collected from initial contact to toe-off. Functional analyses of variance were used to evaluate between-group differences for these outcome variables. Results: Hypo-DFROM group (14M, 10F) displayed the reduced ankle dorsiflexion and inversion angles with increased hip flexion angle as a compensatory kinematic chain movement strategy. In addition, motion restrictions of the ankle are associated with altered muscle activation in both distal and proximal muscles during landing/cutting. Normal-DFROM (25M, 30F) and Hyper-DFROM (11M, 10F) groups also have different movement strategies including greater inversion angle and less EMG activation, which could contribute to further ankle injuries. Conclusions: Our data suggest that limited DFROM negatively affects the ankle joint during demanding movement within the CAI population. These movement patterns in CAI patients with pathomechanical deficits could contribute to further ankle sprains. ? 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

(2023),2023,Allografts as alternative to autografts in primary posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Purpose: Following posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) rupture, autografts and allografts are routinely used for its reconstruction. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of allografts for primary PCL reconstruction, comparing them to autografts in terms of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), functional tests, and complications. Methods: This study followed the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus were accessed in October 2022. All the clinical studies investigating the outcomes of primary PCL reconstruction using allografts, or comparing the outcomes of allografts versus autografts, were accessed. The outcomes of interests were: instrumental laxity, range of motion (ROM), Telos stress radiography, drawer test, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner Activity Scale, and the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. Data on complications were also recorded. Results: A total of 445 patients were included. The mean follow-up was 45.2 ñ 23.8ÿmonths. The mean age of the patients was 30.6 ñ 2.2ÿyears. The time span between the injury and surgical intervention was 12.9 ñ 10ÿmonths. Overall, 28% (125 of 445 patients) were women. Good baseline comparability was found between the two cohorts. No difference was found in terms of Lysholm Score, ROM, Tegner Scale, IKDC, arthrometer laxity, drawer test, and Telos stress radiography. No difference was found in the rates of anterior knee pain and revision. Conclusion: Allografts can be considered a suitable alternative to autografts for PCL reconstruction.

945,SC-328,Dury et al. (2023),2023,Electromyographic Activity of Lower Limb Muscles during Ankle Destabilizing Tests,"Ankle destabilizing devices were developed to improve the recruitment of the evertor muscles. Nevertheless, the activity of lower-leg muscles has never been compared to each other during functional tests performed with destabilization. The objectives were i) to compare the electromyographic activity between the lower-leg muscles during four functional tests performed with ankle destabilization, and ii) to determine sex-related differences in neuromuscular activation. Twenty-six healthy volunteers (13 males, 13 females) performed the modified Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT), unipedal balance and weight-bearing inversion and eversion tests with a destabilizing device, while recording electromyographic activity of the peroneus longus and brevis, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius lateralis and gluteus medius. The activity of peroneal muscles was significantly greater than other muscles during all functional tests. Furthermore, the anterior direction of the mSEBT was the one implying the greatest activity of the peroneus longus muscle compared to the posteromedial (p=0.003) or posterolateral (p<0.001) directions. Finally, no significant sex-related differences in neuromuscular activity were reported. This study highlights the effectiveness of the destabilizing device to involve specifically the peroneal muscles when performing various functional tests. This device should be used by clinicians to be more specific to the stabilizers of the ankle joint during functional exercises. ? 2023. Thieme.

(2023),2023,Chronic Achilles Tendon Repair: Minimally Invasive Turndown Technique with Flexor Hallucis Longus Tendon Transfer,"Achilles tendon ruptures have shown an increased incidence over the past decades. Of those, an estimated 25% are missed at the first presentation. Chronic Achilles tendon ruptures are routinely retracted and unable to be primarily repaired end-to-end. To provide enough length to allow repair, procedures such as V-Y lengthening, central turndown, or grafting are often necessary. Several lengthening techniques have been described, but there is no gold standard. Complications associated with these varying techniques include wound necrosis and infection. We describe a minimally invasive Achilles tendon central turndown technique for performing chronic Achilles tendon repairs while minimizing wound risk and avoiding use of allograft.

Most sports injuries occur without direct contact, and knee valgus with external rotation of the foot is the most common movement. This movement may be related to the injury of the anterior oblique ligament located in the anteromedial quadrant of the knee.

(2023),2023,Association between force fluctuation during isometric ankle abduction and variability of neural drive in peroneus muscles,"Analyzing motor unit (MU) activities of peroneus muscles may reveal the causes of force control deficits of ankle eversion. This study aimed to examine peroneus muscles? MU discharge characteristics and associations between force fluctuation and variability of the neural drive in healthy participants. Thirty-one healthy males participated in this study. MU activities were identified from high-density surface electromyography of peroneus muscles during ankle eversion at 15 and 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Participants increased the contraction level until reaching the target and held it for 15 s. The central 10 s of the hold phase were used for analysis. A cumulative spike train (CST) was calculated using MU firings. Variabilities of the force and CST are represented by the coefficient of variation (CoV). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the association between CoV of force and CoV of CST. For 15 and 30 % MVC trials, CoV of force was 1.86 ñ 1.59 and 1.57 ñ 1.26%, and CoV of CST was 5.01 ñ 3.24 and 4.51 ñ 2.78%, respectively. The correlation was significant at 15% (rho = 0.27, p < 0.001) and 30% (rho = 0.32, p < 0.001) MVC. Our findings suggest that in peroneus muscles, force fluctuation weakly to moderately correlates with neural drive variability. ? 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2023.102780,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology

(2023),2023,Peroneus Longus Split Versus Semitendinosus Tendon Autograft Size: A Cross-sectional Study,"Background: The anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) has been reported to be a suitable autograft for ligament reconstruction with low donor-site morbidity. However, clinical data on graft size are limited. Purpose: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. Results: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 ñ 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 ñ 0.7 cm for the ST (P <.05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 ñ 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 ñ 0.7 mm for the ST (P <.05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P <.01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P <.01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P >.05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P <.05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P >.05). Conclusion: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length. However, predicting graft diameter based on thigh or shank circumference was more challenging, with higher BMIs affecting the ability to predict ST more than AHPLT. ? 2023 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465231165297,American Journal of Sports Medicine

(2023),2023,Comparison of EMG activity in shank muscles between individuals with and without chronic ankle instability when running on a treadmill,"Changes in movement capabilities after an injury to the ankle may impose adaptations in the peripheral and central nervous system. The purpose of our study was to compare the electromyogram (EMG) profile of ankle stabilizer muscles and stride-time variation during treadmill running in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI). Recreationally active individuals with (n = 12) and without (n = 15) CAI ran on a treadmill at two speeds. EMG activity of four shank muscles as well as tibial acceleration data were recorded during the running trials. EMG amplitude, timing of EMG peaks, and variation in stride-time were analyzed from 30 consecutive stride cycles. EMG data were time-normalized to stride duration and amplitude was normalized relative to the appropriate maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) task. Individuals with CAI had similar EMG amplitudes and peak timing, but an altered order of peak EMG activity in ankle stabilizer muscles, a significantly greater EMG amplitude for PL with an increase in speed, and a greater stride-time variability during treadmill running compared with individuals who had no history of ankle sprains. The results of our study indicate that individuals with CAI exhibit altered activation strategies for ankle stabilizer muscles when running on a treadmill. ? 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2023.102773,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology

(2023),2023,Intersession reliability of quadriceps corticospinal excitability: A functional transcranial magnetic stimulation study,"Recording transcranial magnetic stimulation-derived measures during a closed kinetic chain task can serve as a functional technique to assess corticomotor function, which may have implications for activities of daily living or lower extremity injury in physically active individuals. Given the novelty of TMS use in this way, our purpose was to first determine the intersession reliability of quadriceps corticospinal excitability during a single-leg squat. We used a descriptive laboratory study to assess 20 physically active females (22.1 ñ 2.5 years, 1.7 ñ 0.7 m, 66.3 ñ 13.6 kg, Tegner Activity Scale: 5.90 ñ 1.12) over a 14-day period. Two-way mixed effects Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (3,1) (ICC) for absolute agreement were used to assess intersession reliability. The active motor threshold (AMT) and normalized motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed in the vastus medialis of each limb. The dominant limb AMTs demonstrated moderate-to-good reliability (ICC = 0.771, 95% CI = 0.51?0.90; p < 0.001). The non-dominant limb AMTs (ICC = 0.364, 95% CI = 0.00?0.68, p = 0.047), dominant limb MEPs (ICC = 0.192, 95% CI = 0.00?0.71; p = 0.340), and non-dominant limb MEPs (ICC = 0.272, 95% CI = 0.00?0.71; p = 0.235) demonstrated poor-to-moderate reliability. These findings may provide insight into corticomotor function during activities requiring weight-bearing, single-leg movement. However, variability in agreement suggests further work is warranted to improve the standardization of this technique prior to incorporating in clinical outcomes research. ? 2023",Scopus,10.1016/j.brainres.2023.148348,Brain Research

(2023),2023,Anatomic reconstruction of the lateral ligaments using allograft tendon and suspensory fixation for chronic lateral ankle instability with poor remnant quality: results and complications,"Purpose: Treatment of chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI) with poor remnant quality is challenging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical results and complications of anatomic reconstruction of the lateral ligaments using allograft tendon and suspensory fixation in the treatment of such patients. Methods: One hundred and eight patients with CLAI, who were treated surgically using anatomic reconstruction with allograft tendon and suspensory fixation between April 2016 and January 2018 at our hospital, were retrospectively analysed. None of the patients had sufficient ligament remnants for the modified Brostr”m procedure during the intraoperative evaluation. Eighteen patients were excluded. Seventeen patients were lost to follow-up and 73 patients completed the study. The mean duration of instability symptoms was 39.1ÿmonths (range, 6?480ÿmonths). The mean follow-up time was 57.5ÿmonths (range, 48?69ÿmonths). Clinical results were evaluated using the Karlsson scoring scale, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society-Ankle and Hindfoot (AOFAS-AH) score, visual analogue scale (VAS), patients? subjective satisfaction, and incidence of complications. Mechanical stability was evaluated using the varus talar tilt angle (TTA) and anterior talar displacement (ATD). Results: The AOFAS-AH scores significantly improved from 67.7 ñ 8.5 points to 89.8 ñ 9.5 (p < 0.001). The Karlsson scoring scales evolved from 58.8 ñ 16.5 to 88.4 ñ 11.2 (p < 0.001). VAS scores significantly decreased from 2.9 ñ 1.3 to 1.1 ñ 1.0 (p < 0.001). On stress radiographs, TTA decreased from 15.1 ñ 2.5 degrees to 5.8 ñ 2.1 degrees (p < 0.001), whereas ATD reduced from 13.4 ñ 2.9ÿmm to 5.7 ñ 1.5ÿmm (p < 0.001). Patients' subjective satisfaction indicated 46 excellent, 20 good, 5 fair, and 2 bad results. Postoperatively, 15 cases (20.5%) did not achieve complete relief of discomfort or swelling, 9 cases (12.3%) experienced joint stiffness or decreased range of motion, and 6 cases (8.2%) had soft tissue irritation. Residual instability and reoperation are rare. Allograft rejection or wound infection was not observed. Conclusion: For the CLAI patients with poor remnant quality, anatomic reconstruction of the lateral ligaments using allograft tendon and suspensory fixation is an effective procedure, while the top three complications in incidence were residual discomfort, joint stiffness, and soft tissue irritation.

953,SC-336,Wu et al. (2023),2023,Minimizing risk of iatrogenic nerve injury during peroneus longus tendon autograft harvest: a cadaveric study at different ankle or knee positions,"Purpose: To evaluate the distances using ultrasound between the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) and sural nerve along the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft harvest path at different ankle or knee positions in order to minimize risk of iatrogenic nerve injury during PLT autograft harvest. Methods: Twenty-four fresh?frozen human cadaveric lower extremities were used to harvest a full-thickness PLT autograft with a tendon stripper. Four specimens were utilized to validate correct identification of nerves under ultrasound. Sonographically guided perineural injections were performed at the start point and end point of the PLT harvest path using coloured latex, followed by dissection with gross inspection. Using ultrasound, the distance from the peroneus brevis muscle to the sural nerve at different ankle positions (20ø dorsiflexion, neutral, and 20ø plantarflexion) was measured, and the distance from the end of the tendon stripper to the SPN at different knee positions (full extension and 90ø flexion) was also measured. Measurements were performed by two separate observers using ImageJ software. Results: Cadaveric dissection showed the presence of latex around nerves in all four specimens. The average distance from the brevis muscle to the sural nerve increased significantly from dorsiflexion to plantarflexion. The shortest distance from the tenodesis site to the sural nerve was 5.8 ñ 1.7ÿmm. There was no significant difference from the end of the tendon stripper to the SPN between full extension or 90ø flexion of the knee. Conclusion: When harvesting the PLT, it is recommended to place the ankle at plantarflexion. The knee at full extension or 90ø flexion had no effect. Joint positions at the time of graft harvest should be monitored to reduce risks of iatrogenic nerve injury. ? 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-022-07202-0,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"

(2023),2023,The Relationship between Health-Related Quality of Life and Lower-Extremity Visuomotor Reaction Time in Young Adult Women following Ankle Sprain,"Many individuals who sustain a lateral ankle sprain (LAS) fail to return to prior activity due to residual symptoms; and report elevated levels of injury-related fear, decreased function, and decreased health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Additionally, individuals with history of LAS exhibit deficits in neurocognitive functional measures like visuomotor reaction time (VMRT), which contributes to worse patient-reported outcome scores. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between HRQOL and lower-extremity (LE) VMRT in individuals with LAS history. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Young adult female volunteers with history of LAS (n = 22; age = 24 [3.5] y; height = 163.1 [9.8] cm; mass = 65.1 [11.5] kg; and time since last LAS = 67.8 [50.5] mo) completed HRQOL outcomes including the following: (1) Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-11, (2) Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, (3) Penn State Worry Questionnaire, (4) modified Disablement in the Physically Active Scale, and (5) Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI). Additionally, participants completed a LE-VMRT task by responding to a visual stimulus using their foot to deactivate light sensors. Participants completed trials bilaterally. Separate Spearman rho correlations were performed to assess the relationship between patient-reported outcomes assessing constructs of HRQOL and LE-VRMT bilaterally. Significance was set at P < .05. Results: There was a strong, significant negative correlation between FADI-Activities of Daily Living (? = ?.68; P = .002) and FADI-Sport (? = ?.76; P = .001) scores and injured limb LE-VMRT; moderate, significant negative correlations between the uninjured limb LE-VMRT and FADI-Activities of Daily Living (? = ?.60; P = .01) and FADI-Sport (? = ?.60; P = .01) scores; and moderate, significant positive correlations between the injured limb LE-VMRT and modified Disablement in the Physically Active Scale-Physical Summary Component (? = .52; P = .01) and modified Disablement in the Physically Active Scale-Total (? = .54; P = .02) scores. All other correlations were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Young adult women with history of LAS demonstrated an association between self-reported constructs of HRQOL and LE-VMRT. As LE-VMRT is a modifiable injury risk factor, future studies should examine the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve LE-VMRT and the impact on self-reported HRQOL. ? 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2022-0199,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

(2023),2023,Partial peroneus longus tendon reconstruction in the treatment of posterolateral complex injury of the knee joint,"BACKGROUND: Posterolateral knee complex injury can lead to external rotation of the tibia, affecting lower extremity function and quality of life. The reconstruction with partial peroneus longus tendon can restore the stability of the lateral knee joint, but its mechanism is less reported. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of partial peroneus longus tendon reconstruction in the treatment of posterolateral knee complex injury. METHODS: From January 2017 to January 2021, 56 patients with posterolateral knee complex injury were treated in Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University. They were randomly divided into control group and observation group (n=28 per group). Patients in the control group were treated with autogenous hamstring tendon and bone-patellar tendon-bone reconstruction under arthroscopy, while patients in the observation group were treated with partial peroneus longus tendon reconstruction. Knee stability, knee function, and quadriceps femoris muscle strength were evaluated and compared in both groups before and after surgery. General indexes, complications and ankle function were compared between the two groups after surgery. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Length of hospital stay and postoperative visual analogue scale score were lower in the observation group than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Medical cost was less in the observation group than that in the control group (P < 0.05). (2) Hospital for Special Surgery knee score and Lysholm score were higher in the observation group than those in the control group at 1 and 2 months after surgery (P < 0.05). (3) The peak torque and total work of quadriceps femoris were lower in the observation group than those in the control group at 7 days after surgery (P < 0.05). (4) The complication rate of observation group was lower than that of control group after surgery (P < 0.05). (5) Baird-Jackson ankle scoring system at 2 months after surgery showed that motion range, pain score, running ability score, walking ability score, and ankle stability score were higher in the observation group than those in the control group (P < 0.05). (6) It is concluded that application of reconstruction with partial peroneus longus tendon in patients with posterolateral knee complex injuries can effectively improve the knee stability and function, alleviate the pain, promote the recovery of its quadriceps femoris muscle strength and shorten the length of hospital stay. ? 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

The crowding degree of fish swarm was introduced to construct the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACOA), and the maximum and minimum ant system (MMAS) and ant colony algorithm based on variation features (VF-based ACA) were introduced to compare with ACOA. Besides, ACOA was applied to the MRI diagnosis of 98 patients with PLC injuries. Then the number of Degree I, Degree II, and Degree III in PLC patients were compared. The results showed that the iteration times and running time of the optimal solution were obtained by ACOA when the number of cities was 10, which were compared with those obtained by MMAS and VF-based ACA with no great differences (P > 0.05), and the iteration times and running time of ACOA were greater than those of MMAS and VF-based ACA when the number of cities was 50 (P < 0.05). There were 73 patients with PLC injuries involved 2 or more structures, 11 patients with PLC injuries only involved the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and 7 patients with PLC injuries only involved the popliteal tendon (PLT). The injury rates of LCL, medial collateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and PLT were 87.02%, 51.33%, 72.45%, 41.75%, and 84.06%, respectively. The number of patients with PLC injuries combined with Grade I of LCL, PCL, ACL, PCL, biceps femoris tendon, and PLT was higher than that of patients with Grade II and III (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ACOA was much better than MMAS and VF-based ACA in dealing with complex work, which effectively improved the ergodicity of search and reduced the running time. There were more common in PLC injuries combined with LCL, PCL, ACL, PCL, and PLT, MRI images based on ACOA could clearly show the degree of ligament and tendon injuries. ? 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Scopus,10.1111/exsy.12849,Expert Systems

If not managed appropriately, it can lead to chronic ankle syndesmotic insufficiency. Chronic syndesmotic insufficiency is challenging to diagnose, and the patient can suffer for a long time. There is no consensus in previous literature on the surgical treatment of chronic syndesmotic injury. We present a case of personnel who suffered from chronic syndesmotic injury treated by syndesmotic reconstruction 5 years after his ankle fracture dislocation and returned to his work. This case highlights the importance of a CT scan post-reduction of an acute syndesmotic injury to assess accurate reduction, especially in severe injuries with frank diastasis. ?

958,SC-341,Agrawal et al. (2023),2023,Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft for Primary Arthroscopic Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament,"Purpose. Peroneus longus tendon graft is not a popular first choice for ACL recon-struction. However, newer literature has shown good outcomes with its use. This study compares functional outcome and donor site morbidity of peroneus longus with hamstring tendon autograft to assess if it can be considered as one of the first choices for ACLR. Methods. This prospective cohort study involves 54 patients who underwent arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR. 27 patients each were operated on with hamstring and peroneus longus autografts. At 2 years follow-up, functional outcome was compared between groups using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm scores. Donor site morbidity in the peroneus longus group was assessed using Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores. Results. At 2 years follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean IKDC (77.26 vs 80.78), Modified Cincinnati (84.41 vs 89.07), and Tegner-Ly-sholm scores (85.19 vs 88.78) between the hamstring and peroneus groups respec-tively. Mean FADI and AOFAS scores at 2 years follow up were 96.11 and 91.67 respectively in the peroneus group suggesting no significant donor site morbidity as compared to preoperative scores. Conclusions. Peroneus longus performs similar to hamstring grafts and can be considered as one of the first choices for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. ? 2023, EDRA S.p.A.

959,SC-342,Jatmiko; Tinduh et al. (2023),2023,Differences in Ankle Dorsiflexion Deficit Performance between Male and Female Athletes with a History of Lateral Ankle Sprain: The Functional Pre-Participation Evaluation,"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of deficit of ankle dorsiflexion in athletes who sustained a chronic lateral ankle sprain to the hopping performance. A comparative study was designed to compare the deficit and non-deficit condition of ankle dorsiflexion as a result of the weight bearing lunges test to distance hopping ability with single leg hop, which was normalized with leg length. There were no statistically significant differences in hopping performance, deficit vs non-deficit ankle dorsiflexion within-group comparisons in males (P = 0.932) or females (P = 0.999). Between group comparisons showed that ankle dorsiflexion deficit among female resulted lower hopping performance compared to male with / without ankle dorsiflexion deficit (P = 0.041 and P = 0.039). Surprisingly, hopping performance among male with ankle dorsiflexion deficit was further than female without ankle dorsiflexion deficit (P = 0.044). Meanwhile, hopping performance between male versus female without ankle dorsiflexion deficit were not significant (P = 0.054). The deficit of ankle dorsiflexion had no influence on hopping performance in athlete with a history of LAS, both male and female. Sex influenced hopping performance in athletes with ankle dorsiflexion deficits, with female athletes performing worse than male. During recovery, there might be differences in biomechanical adaptation between ankle dorsiflexion deficit conditions in female athletes compared to male. ? 2023 Author (s).",Scopus,10.12982/NLSC.2023.017,Natural and Life Sciences Communications

961,SC-344,Wang et al. (2023),2023,Double-bundle reconstruction of the anterior talofibular ligament by partial peroneal brevis tendon,"Background: Anatomic anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) reconstruction with autologous single-bundle tendon has been widely used in the treatment of ATFL injury. However, there are few clinical reports of using the peroneus brevis tendon (PBT) for double-bundle ATFL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effect of double-bundle ATFL reconstruction with PBT. Methods: This was a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with ATFL injury presenting from August 2019 to December 2021. Fifty-three patients were selected after screening based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The following data were compared before and after surgery: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, Karlsson Ankle Functional Score (KAFS), the pain interference (PI) and physical function (PF) scores of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), the diameter and width of PBT in ultrasound and muscle strength. Results: All functional scores (VAS, PI/PF, AO-FAS, KAFS) and muscle strength were significantly improved at the last follow-up (P < 0.05). The diameter and width of the PBT on ultrasound postoperation were smaller than those preoperatively. Conclusion: Double-bundle ATFL reconstruction with the partial PBT technique is a feasible, anatomic reconstruction technique for chronic lateral instability of the ankle, which meets the anatomical characteristics of the double bundle of the ligament, and the absence of partial PBT does not affect the peroneal muscle strength.

(2023),2023,Allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium (secretome) for treating posterior cruciate ligament rupture: a prospective single-arm study,"Background: Outcomes of the current management of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) rupture are still unsatisfactory. Recent literature demonstrated the efficacy of the paracrine action of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in ligament rupture healing. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of arthroscopic administration of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC (UC-MSC) conditioned medium (secretome) for the treatment of PCL rupture. Patients and methods: This is a prospective study including 12 individuals with PCL rupture grade 1 or 2 who were performed arthroscopy and secretome administrations. The functional and radiologic outcome of the knee was examined one year following intervention. Results: Preoperatively, posterior drawer test revealed three cases of grade 2+ and nine cases of grade 1+, whereas the final follow-up revealed two cases of grade 2+ and ten cases of grade 1+ PCL rupture. At final follow-up, the mean scores for the IKDC, modified Cincinnati, and Lysholm were 90.58 ñ 4.30, 90.90 ñ 2.15, and 89.42 ñ 3.16, respectively. The means of the serial hop tests were 90.33, 94.16, 93.66, and 95.33 for single, triple, crossover, and time hop tests, respectively. Five patients were able to resume competitive sport after an average of 25.8ÿweeks (25?38). The final MRI analysis revealed that six knees (50%) regained PCL continuity with low signal intensity, five knees (41.6%) returned near-normal PCL continuity, and one knee (8.3%) regained PCL continuity but with deformed outlines. Conclusions: Short-term follow-up indicated that the secretome generated from allogenic UC-MSC produces excellent functional and radiographic results in grade I-II PCL rupture. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s00590-022-03278-z,European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology
963,SC-346,Hossain et al. (2023),2023,A prospective study of arthroscopic primary ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft: Experience of 439 cases,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are frequent ligamentous injuries that necessitate reconstruction in many cases. The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P <.001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. The peroneus longus tendon can be considered a safe, effective, and promising graft of choice for arthroscopic primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction because it has a good functional outcome and impressive donor ankle function after surgery. ? 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

(2023),2023,Analysis of Biomechanical Variables Based on the Imbalance of Ankle Muscle Strength in Ballet Dancers,"PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to analyze the biomechanical variables involved in ballet dancers? ankle muscle imbalance when performing relev‚ movements. METHODS The subjects of this study (n=14, age: 22.29ñ1.73 years old, height: 161.4ñ5.06cm, weight: 51.88ñ7.51kg) were 14 ballet dancers with 9 years of experience. Based on the reciprocal muscle strength ratio, the dancers were divided into the following groups: Close to the normal value (RMIS) and far from the normal value (RMIB) using the maximum values of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the ankle joint using an isokinetic measurement equipment (60ø/sec). RMIB). The biomechanical variables, namely the ankle joint movement and ground reaction force, were subsequently measured. SPSS 26.0 was used for data analysis and independent t-test was used for statistical verification. RESULTS The ground reaction force in the Z (vertical) direction based on the ankle joint muscle strength imbalance of ballet dancers was significantly lower in the RMIB group. In addition, although it was not a statistically significant difference, the plantar flexion movement was lower in the RMIB group, and there was a significant difference in the generation of ankle joint movement in the Z direction. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, in order for a ballet dancer to efficiently utilize the force generated from the supporting leg when performing a movement, ankle imbalance must be taken into consideration when training. ?

965,SC-348,Sahoo et al. (2023),2023,Analysis of Postural Control following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Ipsilateral Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"Introduction: Harvesting peroneus longus for ACL reconstruction is thought to create ankle instability which could add to postural instability from an ACL injury. This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. Materials and methods: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three-and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. Results: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals. Conclusion: The static and dynamic balance, which is impaired after ACL injury, improves with ACL reconstruction with PLT autologous graft. Hence PLTG can be safely used as a graft for ACL reconstruction without affecting postural control and body balance. ? 2023, Malaysian Orthopaedic Association.

966,SC-349,Shao et al. (2023),2023,Human Muscle?Derived Cells Are Capable of Tenogenic Differentiation and Contribution to Tendon Repair,"Background: It has been reported that the harvested hamstring tendon for autograft could be regenerated with well-oriented fibers and uniformly distributed spindle-shaped cells after removal. However, which cell type might participate in the repair process remains unknown. Purpose: To investigate the tenogenic differentiation potential of human muscle?derived cells (MDCs) both in vitro and in vivo. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Primary human MDCs and tenocytes were isolated from discarded materials during a peroneus longus tendon?harvesting procedure. Expression of tenogenic genes were evaluated and compared among MDCs, MDCs with tenogenic induction, and tenocytes. RNA sequencing was performed to evaluate the expression profile of differentiated MDCs. Human MDCs were implanted in a tendon injury model to investigate the in vivo tenogenic differentiation potential. Histologic and functional analyses were performed to evaluate the function of MDCs for tendon repair. Results: The relative expression levels (in fold change) of tenogenic genes Col I, MKX, SCX, THBS4, and TNC in MDCs were significantly upregulated 11.5 ñ 1.3, 957.1 ñ 63.7, 19.1 ñ 2.8, 61.9 ñ 4.8, and 10.2 ñ 2.8 after tenogenic induction, respectively. The expression profile of tenogenically differentiated MDCs was much closer to primary tenocytes. Activation of TGF-?/Smad3 signaling significantly promoted the tenogenic differentiation ability of MDCs. Transplanted human MDCs were identified in regenerated tendon and expressed tenogenic genes. As for biomechanical properties, the failure loads in the Matrigel, transplantation, and uninjured groups were 7.2 ñ 0.5, 11.6 ñ 0.3, and 13.9 ñ 0.7 N, while the stiffness values were 4.4 ñ 1.3 ? 103, 7.6 ñ 0.8 ? 103, and 10.9 ñ 1.1 ? 103 N/m. Plantarflexion force, histologic morphology, and motor function were also significantly improved after MDC transplantation in a tendon injury model. Conclusion: There exist cells with tenogenic differentiation potential in human skeletal muscles. Activation of TGF-?/Smad3 signaling plays an important role in tenogenic differentiation for human MDCs. Human MDCs contribute to structural and functional repair for the injured tendon. MDCs are a potential cell source to participate in the repair process after tendon injury. Clinical Relevance: The MDCs could be a promising cell source to repair tendon injury. ? 2023 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465221147486,American Journal of Sports Medicine
967,SC-350,Ashton et al. (2023),2023,"Challenging the Perceptions of Human Tendon Allografts: Influence of Donor Age, Sex, Height, and Tendon on Biomechanical Properties","Background: The use of allograft tendons has increased for primary and revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but allograft supply is currently limited to a narrow range of tendons and donors up to the age of 65 years. Expanding the range of donors and tendons could help offset an increasing clinical demand. Purpose: To investigate the effects of donor age, sex, height, and specific tendon on the mechanical properties of a range of human lower leg tendons. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Nine tendons were retrieved from 39 fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs (35 donors [13 female, 22 male]; age, 49-99 years; height, 57-85 inches [145-216 cm]) including: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior and anterior, fibularis longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, and flexor digitorum longus. Tendons underwent tensile loading to failure measuring cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum load, strain at failure, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus. Results from 332 tendons were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for donor age, sex, height, and weight. Results: Mechanical properties were significantly different among tendons and were substantially greater than the effects of donor characteristics. Significant effects of donor sex, age, and height were limited to specific tendons: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior, and tibialis anterior. All other tendons were unaffected. The Achilles tendon was most influenced by donor variables: greater CSA in men (? = 15.45 mm2; ?id k adjusted P <.0001), decreased maximum load with each year of increased age (? = ?17.20 N per year; adjusted P =.0253), and increased CSA (? = 1.92 mm2 per inch; adjusted P <.0001) and maximum load (? = 86.40 N per inch; adjusted P <.0001) with each inch of increased height. Conclusion: Mechanical properties vary significantly across different human tendons. The effects of donor age, sex, and height are relatively small, are limited to specific tendons, and affect different tendons uniquely. The findings indicate that age negatively affected only the Achilles tendon (maximum load) and challenge the exclusion of donors aged >65 years across all tendon grafts. Clinical Relevance: The findings support including a broader range of tendons for use as allografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and reviewing the current exclusion criterion of donors aged >65 years. ? 2023 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465221143385,American Journal of Sports Medicine

Methods: Twenty-four subjects were recruited for the study. They were randomly divided into groups (A = 12, B = 12). In group A, Kinesio taping was applied on the tibialis posterior, and in group B, Kinesio taping was applied on the fibularis longus and remained for 30ÿmin. Outcome measures were the navicular drop test (NDT), foot posture index (FPI), timed up and go (TUG) test, and Y-balance test. The pre- and post-treatment results were compared for each group; between-group differences were determined as well. Results: For group A, NDT, FPI, and TUG test changed significantly (P = 0.01, P = 0.001, P = 0.006, respectively). For group B, the FPI score decreased (P = 0.03), and the Y-balance test in the anterior direction improved significantly (P = 0.01). Any variables have not shown a significant difference between groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Kinesio taping of the tibialis posterior and fibularis longus can improve foot posture in young women with flexible flatfoot. Also, physical performance and dynamic balance improved by Kinesio taping of the tibialis posterior and the fibularis longus, respectively. In addition to the tibialis posterior, we found that the fibularis longus muscle can be considered a therapeutic target for managing flexible flatfoot in healthy young women. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s11332-022-01013-z,Sport Sciences for Health

Thoracolumbar fascia (TF) padded Kessler suture, polypropylene mesh (PM) padded Kessler suture, and Kessler suture only were performed on the completely transected lateral gastrocnemius tendon, and biomechanical and histologic characteristics were assessed after 8 weeks. For biomechanical assessment, the tensile strength of each repaired tendon was measured according to the established methods. For histomorphometric analysis, hematoxylin and eosin staining for general histology, and Masson?s trichrome (MT) staining for collagen fibers, Alcian blue (AB) staining for proteoglycans were performed and analyzed. Significant increases in tensile strength with remarkable decreases in the abnormalities against nuclear roundness, cell density, fiber structure, and fiber alignment and significant decreases in the mean number of infiltrated inflammatory cells and AB-positive proteoglycan-occupied regions with increases in MT-positive collagen fiber-occupied regions were demonstrated in the Kessler suture with PM or TF padding groups as compared to those of the Kessler suture group. Both of PM and TF provided potent tensile strength and supported healing with the evidence of histological examinations. This means that augmentation with PM is useful for repairing a completely ruptured Achilles tendon, without additional surgery for autograft material harvesting. ?

970,SC-353,Nasirzade et al. (2023),2023,"Influence of circumferential ankle pressure of shoe collar on the kinematics, dynamic stability, electromyography, and plantar pressure during normal walking","Background The shoe?s collar plays a significant role in supporting the ankle during walking. Since the protective effect of the collar requires the circular embracing of the ankle and shank, a stiffer collar might be involved with increased circumferential ankle pressure (CAP). It is not clear how collar CAP affects walking performance. Therefore, this study was aimed at examining the influence of the collar CAP on the kinematics, dynamic stability, electromyography (EMG), and plantar pressure during normal walking. Method Sixteen healthy male participants walked on a treadmill while wearing a custom-designed high-collar shoe with 10 (low), 30 (medium), and 60 mmHg (high) CAP conditions, and the joint angles, dynamic stability index, EMG, and plantar pressure were measured. Result While the low CAP condition did not affect the ankle range of motion (ROM), The high CAP condition restricted both the ankle sagittal and frontal ROM, whereas the medium CAP condition limited only the ankle frontal ROM. The knee and hip ROM did not differ between conditions. The dynamic stability for the high and medium CAP cases was comparable but significantly higher than that of the low CAP condition. The ankle muscle activity and corresponding co-contraction increased with increasing CAP for gastrocnemius medialis (GM), soleus (SOL), peroneus longus (PL), tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in the weight acceptance and push-off phases but not in the single limb support. Knee muscle activity, including vastus lateralis (VL) and semitendinosus (SEMI) was similar between all conditions. A higher relative pressure was observed under the lateral aspect of the heel when walking in the high CAP condition. Conclusion The results suggest that a high-collar shoe with a high CAP may not be an appropriate choice for walking owing to the injury risk factors and limited walking efficiency. A medium CAP is associated with certain advantages and, thus, a superior choice for high-collar shoe design. ? 2023 Nasirzadeh et al.

In this study, Nar was oxidized by sodium periodate and the oxidized naringin (ONar) was used as a novel biological crosslinking agent. In addition, ONar-fixed porcine decellularized Achilles tendon (DAT) was developed to substitute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) for researching a novel ACL replacement material. The ONar with a 24 h oxidation time had appropriate aldehyde group content, almost no cytotoxicity, and a good crosslinking effect. The critical characteristics and cytocompatibility of ONar-fixed DAT were also investigated. The results demonstrated that 1% ONar-fixed DAT exhibited good resistance to enzymatic degradation and thermal stability as well as suitable mechanical strength. Moreover, 1% ONar-fixed specimens exhibited excellent L929 fibroblasts-cytocompatibility and MC3T3-E1-cytocompatibility. They also promoted the secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) from fibroblasts and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) from osteoblasts. And they also showed the good anti-inflammatory properties in vivo experiments.

973,SC-356,Tong et al. (2023),2023,The effects of ankle dorsiflexor fatigue on lower limb biomechanics during badminton forward forehand and backhand lunge,"Background: Local muscle fatigue may have an adverse effect on the biomechanics of the lunge movement and athletic performance. This study analyzed the biomechanical indicators of the forward lunge in badminton players before and after fatigue of the ankle dorsiflexors. Methods: Using the isometric muscular strength testing system, 15 badminton players underwent an ankle dorsiflexor fatigue test. Before and after the fatigue experiment, five lunges were done in both the forehand forward (FH) and backhand forward (BH) directions, five in each direction. A Vicon motion capture system and an AMTI force measuring station were used to record lower limb kinematic and ground reaction force (GRF). Pre-fatigue and post-fatigue variability were determined using paired-samples t-tests, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Statistical Non-parametric Mapping (SNPM). Result: The results showed that after fatigue, the peak angle of ankle dorsiflexion was significantly reduced (p = 0.034), the range of motion (ROM) of the ankle sagittal plane (p = 0.000) and peak angle of ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.001) was significantly increased after forehand landing. After fatigue, ankle inversion was significantly increased after forehand and backhand landings (FH: p = 0.033; BH: p = 0.015). After fatigue, peak knee flexion angles increased significantly (FH: Max: p = 0.000, Min: p = 0.000; BH: Max: p = 0.017, Min: p = 0.037) during forehand and backhand landings and ROM in knee flexion and extension increased (p = 0.009) during forehand landings. Knee inversion range of motion was significantly increased after fatigue (p = 0.024) during forehand landings. Peak hip flexion angle (p = 0.000) and range of motion (p = 0.000) were significantly reduced in forehand landings after fatigue. The mean loading rate (p = 0.005) and the maximum loading rate (p = 0.001) increased significantly during backhand landings after fatigue. Post-fatigue, the center of pressure (COP) frontal offset increased significantly (FH: p = 0.000; BH: p = 0.000) in the forehand and backhand landings. Conclusion: These results indicate that when the ankle dorsiflexors are fatigued, the performance of the forehand is significantly negatively affected, and the impact force of the backhand is greater. ? ? 2023 Tong, Lu, Cen, Chen, Ugbolue and Gu.",Scopus,10.3389/fbioe.2023.1013100,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology
974,SC-357,Jiawei et al. (2023),2023,Hip and knee coordination patterns in relation to lower limb muscle activity during drop jumps at different heights,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal joint movements are associated with injury. Joint coordination is commonly used to analyze joint movements and muscle activity can potentially affect inter-joint coordination. However, there are yet no sufficient studies in this field. OBJECTIVE: To identify the inter-segment coordination patterns and muscle activity levels of the hip and knee joints during drop jump at different heights and the correlation between them. METHODS: Nineteen young men were tested with 40, 60, and 80 cm drop jumps, and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus maximus, semitendinosus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis was measured, hip and knee joint angles were calculated and coordination patterns were calculated using a vector coding technique. Changes in lower limb muscle activity and hip and knee coordination patterns were compared using one-way repeated measures of variance. Pearson and Spearman analyses were used to relate the percentage of inter-segment coordination patterns to EMG activity levels. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in the percentage of in-phase and knee-phase in the sagittal plane between 40 and 60 cm, 40 and 80 cm, and 60 and 80cm during the contact-take-off of drop jumps at different heights (P < 0.001). There were significant differences in the percentage of in-phase and knee-phase in the horizontal plane between 40 and 80 cm as well as between 60 and 80 cm (P < 0.001). Muscle activity of the semitendinosus was significantly different between 40 and 60 cm (P < 0.05). Muscle activity of the rectus femoris was significantly different between 40 and 80 cm (P < 0.05). Muscle activity of the semitendinosus at 40 cm was positively correlated with the percentage of in-phase in the sagittal plane (r=0.46, P=0.046). Muscle activity of the gluteus maximus at 40 cm and that of the rectus femoris at 80 cm both had a positive correlation with the percentage of in-phase in the horizontal plane (r=0.43, P=0.064; r=0.45, P=0.069). To conclude, as height increases, hip and knee in-phase coordination decreases and distal knee dominant coordination increases, with better coordination of the lower limb joints at the height of 40 cm and 60 cm, predicting a lower risk of injury when training at this gradient. Muscle activity levels can increase with height and muscle activities of the semitendinosus, gluteus maximus and rectus femoris are associated with coordinated hip and knee movements. ? 2023, Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

(2023),2023,PSEUDO-LABEL TRAINING AND MODEL INERTIA IN NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION,"Like many other machine learning applications, neural machine translation (NMT) benefits from over-parameterized deep neural models. However, these models have been observed to be brittle: NMT model predictions are sensitive to small input changes and can show significant variation across re-training or incremental model updates. This work studies a frequently used method in NMT, pseudo-label training (PLT), which is common to the related techniques of forward-translation (or self-training) and sequence-level knowledge distillation. While the effect of PLT on quality is well-documented, we highlight a lesser-known effect: PLT can enhance a model's stability to model updates and input perturbations, a set of properties we call model inertia. We study inertia effects under different training settings and we identify distribution simplification as a mechanism behind the observed results. ? 2023 11th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2023.

977,SC-360,Elmahdy et al. (2023),2023,Correlation between contractile properties of quadriceps muscle and functional performance in runners with patellofemoral pain syndrome,"Background: Long distance runners commonly complain from patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) that limits their performance and return to sport. Abnormal neuromuscular control of the quadriceps has been demonstrated to cause patellar mal-tracking and hence PFPS. Changes in muscle morphology and neural activity have a role in neuromuscular changes, a key contributor to either primary or secondary injuries. Poor landing mechanics, impaired postural control, as well as changed peripheral muscle activation are all clinical manifestations of neuromuscular control deficiencies caused by central nervous system defects that have a deleterious effect on the contractile characteristics of skeletal muscle. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between contractile properties of quadriceps muscle and functional performance in long distance runners with PFPS. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Thirty runners were recruited form multiple Egyptian clubs. Tensiomyography (TMG) Parameters were assessed regarding Contraction time (Tc), Maximal displacement (Dm), Sustain time (Ts), Relaxion time (Tr) and Delay time (Td) in Rectus femoris (RF), Vastus medialis (VM) and Vastus lateralis (VL) separately and correlated with functional performance; number of repetitions in 30 seconds for anteromedial lunge test, balance and reach test and step-down test. Outcome measures: Functional performance was measured using functional performance tests; anteromedial lunge test, balance and reach test and step-down test. Results: It was found that VM Tc, VL Dm, were moderately positively correlated with anteromedial lunge (r = 0.583, 0.404, p<0.05) respectively. In contrast, RF Tr was negatively correlated with anteromedial lunge (-0.364, p<0.05); VM Ts,Tr,Dm; VL Td were moderately negatively correlated with balance and reach (r = -0.577, - 0.388, 0.655 and -0.385, respectively, p<0.05). In contrast, VL Tc was moderately positively correlated with step-down (r = 0.424, p = 0.019). Conclusion: All contractile properties of quadriceps muscle are significantly correlated with functional performance in long distance runners with PFPS. Future studies should address these properties, using proper rehabilitation strategies, to improve performance of runners with PFPS. ? 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

978,SC-361,Rajanigandha et al. (2023),2023,Clinically Oriented Morphological Study of the Peroneal Muscles in Human Cadavers,"Introduction: the objective of this anatomical investigation was to record the morphology of peroneus longus (PL), brevis (PB) and tertius (PT) muscles in human cadaveric specimens. Material and Methods: this study utilized 40 cadaveric formalin fixed lower limb specimens. The leg region was meticulously dissected to expose the muscle belly and their tendons to study the morphology. They were traced till their insertion in the foot. The morphometric data were recorded by using the digital Vernier caliper. results: PL tendon was inserting to the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform bones in 32 specimens (80%), to the shaft of first metatarsal in 3 cases (7.5%) and in 5 specimens, tendon got inserted into the second metatarsal (12.5%). Thirty PB specimens (75%) had tubular morphology at the insertion and 10 specimens (25%) showed a fan or triangular shaped flattened insertion into the fifth metatarsal. The PT was observed in all of our specimens (100%). It presented a single tendon at the site of insertion in 28 specimens (70%), presented a flattered broad insertion (band like) in 7 specimens (17.5%). This morphology shared a slip to the PB and in 5 specimens (12.5%), the muscle got inserted into the fourth metatarsal and gave fibrous expansion to the extensor digitorum longus. Conclusion: we believe that the morphological data of the peroneal muscles presented in this study are beneficial to the plastic and reconstructive surgeries, ankle and foot surgeries during the muscle flap and correction procedures of the lower extremity. ? 2023 Brazilian Society of Anatomy.

979,SC-362,Alardi et al. (2023),2023,Hamstring graft size for anterior cruciate ligament repair in a sample of Iraqi men,"The goal of the current investigation was to measure the size of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft following hamstring (gracilis and semitendinosus) tendon autograft procedures in a relatively large sample size of Iraqi men. In this study, the quadruple hamstring tendon (semitendinosus and gracilis) was measured in a sample of Iraqi adult males. The study enrolled 300 Iraqi men who underwent anterior cruciate ligament repair at Diwaniyah Teaching Hospital and Alforat Alawast Private Hospital between January 2020 and December 2021. The repair procedure was based on the utilization of the quadruple (gracilis and semitendinosus) hamstring tendon. The primary outcome measure was the size of the tendon, determined using a sizing tube calibrated to 0.5 mm. 80% of patients had a graft diameter of 7.5 mm, while 15% had a graft diameter of 8 mm, and 5% had a diameter of 7 mm. Body mass index was a poor predictor of graft size, whereas patient height was an excellent predictor of graft diameter. The graft diameter in most Iraqi subjects with anterior cruciate ligament injuries needs to be five bands or even six bands; otherwise, other graft sources like bone-patellar-bone or peroneus longus tendon grafts should be considered. The graft diameter may be reliably anticipated based on the patient?s height. ? 2023, Carol Davila University Press. All rights reserved.",Scopus,10.25122/jml-2023-0071,Journal of Medicine and Life

Methodology: This prospective study was done at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Lahore General Hospital, Lahore from January 2021 to November 2022. A total of 25 patients of either gender aged 18-40 years with isolated chronic PCL injury duration above 6 months and planned to undergo PCL reconstruction with PLT graft were included in the study. Functional scoring according to ?International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)?, ?Modified Cincinnati? and ?Lysholm scores? were done prior to surgery and at the end of follow-up period (9-months). Results: In a total of 25 cases, the mean age was 26.86ñ7.83 years, The mean graft diameter was 8.34ñ0.69 mm. The mean pre-surgery IKDC score was 51.72ñ9.82 and 72.61ñ5.9 9-months after surgery (p<0.001). The mean modified Cincinnati scores were 52.66ñ9.04 and 71.35ñ6.2 at pre-surgery and after 9-months following surgery (p<0.001). The mean Lysholm score was 52.48ñ8.53 at baseline and 71.67ñ6.8 9-months after surgery (p<0.001). Post-Surgery (after 9-months) thigh circumference (cm) between injury site and contralateral healthy site at 10cm and 20cm proximal to upper patellar bone showed no significant differences. Conclusion: Single bundle PCL reconstruction with PLT autograft showed good functional outcomes at 9-month followup. ? 2023, Pakistan Medical Association.

981,SC-364,Rezazadeh Nochehdehi et al. (2023),2023,"Structure, function, and biomechanics of meniscus cartilage","The meniscus?a fibrocartilaginous structure?located between the femur and tibia plays a significant role in physical motion at the knee joint. The role of the lateral and medial menisci is to distribute and transmit static and dynamic loads significantly, absorb impact, reduce friction surfaces, and stabilize the knee joints. According to an American Physical Therapy Association report, 1 million people in the United States undergo knee surgery every year. In addition, 700,000 people in the United States suffer from meniscus injury every year. Hence, the aim of the proposed paper is to identify newly developed materials that must be highly compatible and of the appropriate mechanical strength to fulfill main function of meniscus cartilage at the knee joint. Understanding the mechanical behavior and mechanism of motion in knee joints led to the prevention of dislocations, fractures, and cartilage tearing, which are the most common knee injuries among people of different ages. The extensive research carried out by medical scientists reduced the side effects of such surgical procedure, but the main challenges related to total meniscus cartilage replacement remained. Ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene fabricated by the 3D printing technique has shown the lowest roughness compared with the blended model. Hence, polyvinyl alcohol combined with chitosan, which has been seeded by mesenchymal stem cells, has shown high tensile strength by increasing the amount of chitosan. Meanwhile, high biocompatibility and low degeneration have been identified by fabricating a three-dimensional polycaprolactone scaffold. Therefore PCL (polycaprolactone), PLA (polylactic acid), and PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) combined by collagen and the extracellular matrix have been fabricated by electrospinning techniques. Regarding total replacement of meniscus cartilage, fundamental research is needed due to novelty biocompatible materials being developed. ? 2024 Elsevier Inc.

982,SC-365,Ghislieri et al. (2023),2023,Balance and Muscle Synergies During a Single-Limb Stance Task in Individuals With Chronic Ankle Instability,"The aim of this study was to investigate balance performance and muscle synergies during a Single-Limb Stance (SLS) task in individuals with Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI) and a group of healthy controls. Twenty individuals with CAI and twenty healthy controls were asked to perform a 30-second SLS task in Open-Eyes (OE) and Closed-Eyes (CE) conditions while standing on a force platform with the injured or the dominant limb, respectively. The activation of 13 muscles of the lower limb, hip, and back was recorded by means of surface electromyography. Balance performance was assessed by identifying the number and the duration of SLS epochs, and the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) in Antero-Posterior (AP) and Medio-Lateral (ML) directions of the body-weight normalized ground reaction forces. The optimal number of synergies, weight vectors, and activation coefficients were also analyzed. CAI group showed a higher number and a shorter duration of SLS epochs and augmented ground reaction force RMS in both AP and ML directions compared to controls. Both groups showed an increase in the RMS in AP and ML forces in CE compared to OE. Both groups showed 4 optimal synergies in CE, while controls showed 5 synergies in OE. CAI showed a significantly higher weight of knee flexor muscles in both OE and CE. In conclusion, muscle synergies analysis provided an in-depth knowledge of motor control mechanisms in CAI individuals. They showed worse balance performance, a lower number of muscle synergies in a CE condition and abnormal knee flexor muscle activation compared to healthy controls. ? 2023 IEEE.",Scopus,10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3328933,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering
983,SC-366,Chung et al. (2023),2023,Effects of A Single Balance Training Session on Neural Excitability in Individuals With Chronic Ankle Instability,"Context: Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) demonstrate reduced spinal reflex modulation and corticospinal excitability of the soleus, which may contribute to decreased balance performance. Objective: To determine the effects of a single session of balance training on Spinal-reflexive excitability modulation and corticospinal excitability in those with CAI. Design: Randomized controlled trials. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Thirty participants with CAI were randomly assigned to the balance training (BAL) or control (CON) group. Main Outcome Measures: Modulation of soleus spinal-reflexive excitability was measured by calculating relative change in normalized Hoffmann reflexes (ratio of the H-reflex to the M-wave) from prone to single-leg standing. Corticospinal excitability was assessed during single-leg stance using transcranial magnetic stimulation, outcomes of which included active motor threshold (AMT), motor evoked potential, and cortical silent period (CSP). Balance performance was measured with center of pressure velocity in anterior to posterior and medial to lateral directions. Separate 2 ? 2 repeated-measures analyses of variance were employed to determine the effect of group (BAL and CON) and time (baseline and posttraining) on each dependent variable. Results: There were significant group by time interactions in the modulation of soleus spinal-reflexive excitability (F<inf>1,27</inf> = 4.763, P = .04); CSP at 100% AMT (F<inf>1,27</inf> = 4.727, P = .04); and CSP at 120% AMT (F<inf>1,27</inf> = 16.057, P < .01). A large effect size suggests increased modulation of spinal-reflexive excitability (d = 0.81 [0.03 to 1.54]) of the soleus in BAL compared with CON at posttest, while CSP at 100% (d = 0.95 [0.17 to 1.70]) and 120% AMT (d = 1.10 [0.29 to 1.84]) was reduced in BAL when compared with CON at posttest. Conclusion: After a single session of balance training, individuals with CAI initiated increases in spinal reflex modulation and corticospinal excitability of the soleus. Thus, individuals with CAI who undergo balance training exhibit positive neural adaptations that are linked to improvements in balance performance. ? 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2023-0024,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation
984,SC-367,Wen et al. (2023),2023,Effect of Low-Load Blood Flow Restriction Training on Patients With Functional Ankle Instability: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Context: Decreased muscle strength and balance in patients with functional ankle instability (FAI) can be effectively improved by ankle strength training. Low-load blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) training increases muscle size and strength, but there is limited evidence from studies on muscle strength and balance in FAI patients. Objective: To study the effects of LL-BFR training versus high-load training (HLT) on muscle strength and balance in FAI patients. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Participants: Forty-six young adults with a history of FAI. Interventions: Participants in the LL-BFR and HLT groups performed 4 sets (30 ? 15 ? 15 ? 15) of ankle training at 20% to 40% of the one-repetition maximum and 70% to 85% one-repetition maximum, respectively, twice a week for 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measure(s): Plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion muscle strength, and the Y-balance test scores were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks; the thickness of the tibialis anterior, triceps surae, and peroneus longus muscles were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks. Results: Inversion, eversion, dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion muscle strength; tibialis anterior, triceps surae, and peroneus longus thickness; and Y-balance test scores were significantly increased in the LL-BFR group after 3 and 6 weeks compared with baseline (P < .05), with no significant difference between the LL-BFR and HLT groups after 6 weeks (P > .05). However, at the end of 3 weeks, eversion muscle strength and Y-balance test scores were significantly higher in the LL-BFR group than in the HLT group (P < .05). Conclusions: Over 6 weeks, LL-BFR training was as effective as HLT in improving ankle muscle strength, muscle thickness, and balance in FAI patients, but LL-BFR training improved the ankle eversion muscle strength and dynamic balance more than HLT did in the early stages of the intervention. This finding will provide a new intervention strategy for the clinical rehabilitation of FAI patients. ? 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2022-0462,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

Recently, the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concurrent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstructed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19ñ8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values. QT and PLT grafts are valuable alternatives for currently used grafts in combined ACL and ALL reconstructive procedures. This new technique is a reasonable option in ACL revision surgery and a good alternative in primary ACL and ALL reconstruction, especially when hamstring grafts are not advised or they are missing. ? 2023, Dr. Mladen Stojanovic University Hospital.

(2023),2023,Atypical Tendon of Peroneus Tertius: Promising Autograft in Ligament Repair,"Introduction: variable insertions of peroneus tertius (PT) muscle tendon is described by various authors. Mention of extra PT tendon is also described in literature. Autologus tendon grafting is a blooming arena of clinical research at present time. Scarcity of auto graft and difficulty of choosing an appropriate auto graft often perplex reconstructive surgeons. There is paucity of data with regard to use of PT muscle tendon as auto graft. Case Report: we report here an extra tendon of PT muscle joining with the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) tendon. The extra PT tendon with optimum length and thickness is indeed an additional advantage from the point of view of auto graft harvesting. Discussion: we believe that though partial or total removal of the PT tendon might result in some degree of functional loss in maintaining steadiness and eversion, but presence of extra tendon will enable to use only the extra tendon not directly involved in primary action thereby minimising any possible functional impairment. An extra tendon of the PT muscle comparable in dimension with that of its primary tendon as reported here has promising opportunities in tendon grafting. Conclusion: the anatomical variation of extra tendon of PT can be of tremendous future prospects to be used as an alternate tendon auto graft in ligament repair. ? 2023 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

To date, no study has examined the effect of ankle kinesiotaping on eccentric versus concentric subtalar evertor and invertor strength nor compared its effect between evertors and invertors. This study examined the effect of kinesiotaping on peak subtalar evertor and invertor eccentric and concentric torques assessed at 120ø/sec. Eccentric versus concentric torque in both muscle groups as well as evertor versus invertor torque at both modes of muscle contraction were examined. Methods. A group of 30 healthy individuals (24 males and 6 females) with mean age 21 ñ 2.73 years, height 1.73 ñ 0.08 m, and weight 75 ñ 6.20 kg were tested. They were randomly tested with kinesio tape use and without. The kinesio tape was applied on the tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles. The peak torques were assessed using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer. Results. 2?2?2 Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed that the peak torque was significantly higher with kinesio tape use compared with no tape for both eccentric and concentric evertors, and eccentric invertors (p 0.009). The eccentric peak torque was significantly higher than the concentric for both evertors and invertors with kinesio tape use, and evertors with no tape (p 0.001). Finally, the invertor concentric torque was significantly higher than the evertor torque with no tape use (p < 0.001). Conclusions. Ankle kinesiotaping improves both evertor and invertor torques, with the eccentric torque being significantly im-proved compared with the concentric. No significant effect on evertors versus invertors was found. This suggests kinesio tape use for managing musculoskeletal disorders caused by impaired subtalar muscle strength as lateral ankle sprains. ?

The peroneus longus tendon is used in many orthopedic surgeries to regenerate the external ligaments of the knee. This study aims to evaluate some anatomical, biomechanical, and load-bearing properties of the peroneus longus tendon for use in cruciate ligament reconstruction. Materials and Methods. The study design is a cross-sectional description. The study subjects were 20 samples of the peroneus longus tendon from fresh carcasses. The leg is still intact, not crushed, is well preserved, and it has never been used in research. Results. The average length of the peroneus longus tendon was 29.25 ñ 2.1 cm, and the average distance from the peroneus longus tendon to the deep peroneal nerve was 71.1 ñ 8.63 mm. The peroneus longus tendon did not have an accessory ligament, the maximum tension of the peroneus longus tendon was 1170.4 ñ 203 N, and the maximum length at break was 14.29 ñ 3.88 mm. Conclusion. Removing the peroneus longus tendon will not affect the surrounding anatomical components. The maximum breaking force and the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon are similar to other graft materials, such as the hamstring tendon and patellar tendon. ? 2023 Quan Nguyen Hoang and Khanh Nguyen Manh.",Scopus,10.1155/2023/2018363,Advances in Orthopedics

We propose a technique that combines the advantages of external fixation (to obtain a stable reduction of ACJ) and a modified suspension device system (for minimally invasive ACJ reconstruction) in acute dislocations. We tend to add associate augmentation of autologous semitendinosus graft to supply a biological reconstruction of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments in chronic dislocations. Material and Methods: We enrolled 8 patients, 6 with acute and 2 with chronic injuries. Inclusion criteria were the following: types IV, V, and VI ACJ dislocations; type III ACJ dislocations in high-demand patients. Exclusion criteria were the following: asymptomatic chronic ACJ dislocation without functional impairment, previous coracoid or clavicle fracture, nonparticipating patients, alcohol abusers, previous infection, and neurological problems. The external fixator was removed at 40 days after surgery and patients were followed up clinically (through Constant Score and Simple Shoulder Test Questionnaires) and radiologically for the first three months, at six months and one year after surgery. Results: In all cases, radiographic ACJ reduction was maintained at a minimum one-year follow-up. Steel wire breakage occurred in one patient but the retained tip in the clavicle was asymptomatic; we report no further complications. Shoulder active and passive range of motion was painless in all patients; the Constant score (CS) was 85/100 and the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) score was 9/10 on average at one year of follow-up. Conclusions: Our technique demonstrated stable joint reduction and good functional outcomes at one-year follow-up and it seems to be promising, but more clinical and biomechanical studies are required to confirm these encouraging results. ? 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Scopus,10.1142/S0218957723500082,Journal of Musculoskeletal Research

992,SC-375,Huang et al. (2023),2023,"The diversity, distribution, and status of phytoplasma diseases in China","Phytoplasmas are important prokaryotic pathogenic bacteria causing many plant diseases, which were formerly known as mycoplasma-like organisms (MLOs), and belong to the Mollicutes class, Candidatus Phytoplasma genus. They are widely distributed in plants and insects in China and can cause serious diseases in important food crops, vegetables, fruit trees, ornamental plants and trees, resulting in huge economic losses. To date, more than 100 phytoplasma diseases have been reported in China, which are distributed throughout the country. Jujube witches' broom, paulownia witches' broom, wheat blue dwarf, banana bunchy top, sugarcane white leaf, and mulberry dwarf represent the phytoplasma diseases causing the most serious damage in China. New phytoplasma diseases and their strains are being reported continuously, indicating that phytoplasmas are more diverse than the previously thought. Phytoplasmas are mainly transmitted by piercing-sucking insect vectors, such as leafhopper, planthopper, and psyllid, among which leafhopper and fulgoroidea are the primary insect vectors, and through Cuscuta australis (known as dodder). Mixed infections of phytoplasmas and viruses, bacteria, and spiroplasmas have also become a serious problem in several crops and are responsible for more synergistic losses. With the continuous development and improvement of technology, molecular biological detection has become the main technique for phytoplasma detection and identification in China, such as nested-PCR, immunocapture PCR, real-time PCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification. In China, phytoplasma diseases are mainly controlled by strengthening quarantine, pruning infected parts, planting resistant varieties, treating with hot water, using tetracycline, and controlling insect vectors and natural hosts. Currently, research on phytoplasma diseases in China mainly focuses on pathogen identification and classification, and insect vector and host diversity; however, there is less focus on pathogenicity, comparative genomics, and effector factors. More research attention has been paid to wheat blue dwarf phytoplasma, paulownia witches'-broom phytoplasma, jujube witches' broom phytoplasma, and sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma. Other phytoplasma diseases have been reported; however, there have been no in-depth studies. In this chapter, the history and present situation of phytoplasma research, and the diversity, distribution, and status of phytoplasma diseases are summarized, and some possible future research directions in China are discussed. ? 2023 Elsevier Inc.

(2023),2023,Effects of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction combined with sodium hyaluronate on knee function and inflammatory markers in anterior cruciate ligament injury patients with or without knee osteoarthritis,"Background. Anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACLI) is a common sports injury of the knee joint, and ACLI patients often develop early knee osteoarthritis (KOA) after surgery. This may be due to the activation of a post-surgical inflammatory response. Objectives. To investigate the treatment efficacy of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (AACLR) combined with sodium hyaluronate (SH) in ACLI patients with and without KOA. Materials and methods. This prospective cohort study included 226 ACLI patients with or without KOA who were admitted between July 2015 and December 2018 into The Second Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China. All patients received AACLR surgery combined with 50 mg SH. Serum levels of inflammatory markers were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and knees were assessed using the Lysholm Knee Score and the International Knee Documentation Committee Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC). The range of motion of the knee joint was also measured. Results. The mean disease course was 73.39 ñ30.90 months for ACLI patients with KOA, which was significantly longer than for those without KOA (3.74 ñ1.70 months). Also, surgery duration was remarkably longer for patients with KOA than it was for those without this disease. The Lysholm Knee Score and IKDC score, as well as the range of knee joint motion were significantly improved in all patients after treatment compared to baseline. However, no significant differences were found between the groups. One day, 3 days and 7 days after surgery, significantly higher inflammatory marker levels were found in the patients with KOA than in those without KOA. Conclusions. The AACLR combined with SH was efficacious as it improved knee function and inflammation in all patients, while patients without KOA exhibited a more rapid recovery from the post-surgical inflammatory response. ? by Author(s)",Scopus,10.17219/acem/156659,Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine

Under this condition, staged reconstruction is a reasonable choice. However, simultaneous reconstruction may be better for the ligament balancing, as well as for earlier rehabilitation and recovery [1]. We would like to introduce a simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), posteromedial corner (PMC), and posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstruction technique to present the basic principle and sequences of bone tunnel creation, graft emplacement, and final distal fixation (Table 47.1). Theoretically, simultaneous four-ligament reconstruction of the knee can be performed in the most complicated combination involving double-bundle ACL and PCL reconstruction [2, 3]. However, in our current clinical practice, the most performed simultaneous four-ligament reconstruction procedures involve always single-bundle ACL and PCL reconstruction instead of double-bundle ACL and PCL reconstruction, as well as single-bundle PMC and single-femoral tunnel PLC reconstruction [4]. The indication of this technique is the combination of the indications of each isolated ligament reconstruction in case of multi-ligament injuries. ?

(2023),2023,Single Bundle Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Without Remnant Preservation,"The classical single-bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction follows the principle of isometric reconstruction, and its purpose is to keep the distance between the ends of the reconstructed ligaments to the minimum during the whole process of knee extension and flexion, to prevent the ligament from bearing excessive stress and resulting in reconstruction failure. The PCL femoral tunnel is supposed to be located at 1:30 (right knee), 10 mm from the distal cartilaginous margin. The PCL tibial tunnel or attachment is supposed to be in the groove between the posterior edge of the medial and lateral tibial condyles and is recommended to be located 10 mm away from the articular surface of the tibia and laterally from the midline. The native PCL is not an isometric structure. Isometric PCL reconstruction may not restore its anatomy and function. In the design of isometric PCL reconstruction, the location of the femoral tunnel is set too proximally and posteriorly, which may reduce the function of the reconstructed PCL [1]. Thus, we prefer anatomical PCL reconstruction. ? Henan Science and Technology Press 2022.",Scopus,10.1007/978-981-19-3971-6_32,0

Following ACL rupture, the remnant always disappears when the injury is chronic. However, there are still some patients having the remnant retained to some extent even in chronic stage. In acute stage of ACL rupture, the remnant is always preserved, which may be due to that the absorption process has not begun [1]. During ACL reconstruction, whether to preserve the remnant is of controversy. Recent study indicated that ACL reconstruction with remnant preservation promotes similar graft synovial coverage and revascularization, and better sealing of the tibial tunnel, results in equivalent or superior postoperative knee stability and clinical scores, better proprioception restoration and similar total complication rate when compared with ACL reconstruction with remnant removal [2?5]. In our clinical practice, the remnant is always preserved when there is enough room for the graft and the remnant in the femoral notch. ?

However, because the peroneus longus tendon has an important function of ankle eversion, maintaining the arch and standing balance, it is still necessary to clinically verify whether the complete removal of the peroneus longus tendon will cause significant ankle dysfunction. In recent years, studies have suggested that there is no significant effect on foot and ankle function in the short term after the complete removal of peroneus longus tendon [1, 2], but there is a lack of long-term follow-up results. To avoid the complete loss of function caused by the complete removal of peroneus longus tendon, thus affecting the long-term function of the ankle, Zhao et al. developed the technique of harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) while retaining the posterior Half. It has been clinically verified that there is no significant influence on foot and ankle function [3]. Anatomical studies showed that AHPLT is longer than the posterior half, and its usable length would be close to 24 cm if harvested proximally from the lateral malleolus level. Biomechanical studies have shown that the AHPLT has the same strength as the semitendinosus tendon (ST) and is an ideal graft for knee ligament reconstruction. ?

Compared with anatomical SB-ACLR, anatomical DB-ACLR has been proved advantageous biomechanically. However, anatomical DB-ACLR is not so popular in clinical practice due to various reasons, with technical difficulty as the main one. Regarding the methods of DB-ACLR, most authors recommend trans-medial portal technique and consider anatomical DB-ACLR cannot be realized with the transtibial technique [3], though better graft maturation was revealed with the transtibial technique [4]. However, in our clinical practice we found that if the projections of the tibial tunnels are appropriately controlled during their creation, an anatomical creation of the two femoral tunnels through the tibial tunnels can always be realized. Thus, we would like to introduce this anatomical transtibial DB-ACLR technique. The indication of this technique is any complete ACL tear indicated for surgery in young, active skeletally mature patients. ?

(2023),2023,Combined ACL-Mimicking Anterolateral Structure Reconstruction and Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction outcomes, reported in the past two decades, leave room for improvement [1, 2]. Studies have suggested that one of the reasons for failure after ACL reconstruction is not taking cognizance of knee anterolateral structure (ALS) deficiency [3, 4]. We consider that the addition of a special ALS with a route similar to that of the ACL may be more helpful. Thus, we developed a method to augment double-bundle ACL reconstruction with the reconstruction of an ACL-mimicking ALS, with a similar route to that of the ACL on the lateral aspect of the knee [5]. The main indications of this technique are ACL injuries with a high degree of pivot shift test, general joint laxity, or a 12- to 15-degree posterior tibial slope as well as revision surgeries. For those who take part in cutting and pivoting movement frequently, we also recommend combined ALS and ACL reconstruction, no matter they have the above-mentioned indications or not. In patients with high failure risks, we encountered approximately 20% clinical failure following routine double-bundle ACL reconstruction. However, we reduce the failure rate to less than 4% when we took combined ALS and double-bundle ACL reconstruction [6]. ?

However, the clinical outcomes of ACL reconstruction are still unsatisfactory [1]. Studies have indicated that knee anterolateral structure (ALS) deficiency may be one of the reasons that lead to failure after ACL reconstruction [2]. Thus, anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction has been performed to augment the reconstructed ACL. Recent studies revealed that ALL reconstruction was helpful biomechanically [3], but still nonoptimal clinically [4]. An anatomical analysis revealed that the route of ALL is quite different from that of ACL on the lateral view of the knee. We considered that the difference between the passing direction of ALL and ACL may be the reason why ALL reconstruction was not so favorable regarding augmenting the reconstructed ACL. Thus, we develop a method to augment ACL reconstruction by reconstructing an ACL-mimicking anterolateral structure (ALS), with a route like that of ACL. We name this combined ACL reconstruction and ACL-mimicking ALS reconstruction technique as condyle-pinching double-bundle ACL reconstruction because this technique appears to be two ACL structure reconstructions with the lateral femoral condyle lying in between. ?

After rupture of the entire anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), most of the tendon fibers are always absorbed. However, after total rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), the tendon fibers are seldom absorbed. In the chronic stage of PCL injury, non-absorbed remnant fiber always forms connection between the femur and the tibia. As for the clinical results of PCL reconstruction still leave large room for improvement, PCL reconstruction with remnant preservation have long been considered, and various related techniques have been reported [1?4].

Combined ACL and anterolateral structure (ALS) reconstruction has been proved effective to address the unfavorable condition in primary and revision ACL reconstruction [4?6]. In revision ACL reconstruction, the lack of enough graft tissue is of concern when combined ACL and ALS reconstruction is to be performed [7]. The iliotibial band (ITB) is a usable structure to realize lateral extraarticular tenodesis (LET) [8], and part of it can be used as graft tissue to reconstruct the ACL. Thus, for revision ACL reconstruction, we combine the use of free tendon grafts and the ITB to perform ACL and ALS reconstruction, as well as LET, which we name three-in-one procedure. This procedure is indicated to patients who is suitable to one-stage revision ACL reconstruction, and the available grafting tendons is not enough. In primary combined ALS and single-bundle ACL reconstruction [4], in case the six-stranded intraarticular graft made from all three of the semitendinosus tendon (ST), gracilis tendon (GT), and the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) is less than 8 mm in size, we also take the current three-in-one procedure as a salvaging technique. ?

At the femoral and tibial insertions of the native PCL, the ligament fibers spread over large irregular areas. Single-bundle PCL reconstruction cannot restore the native PCL anatomically, and double-bundle PCL reconstruction may restore the footprint coverage and fiber configuration to a larger extent [1]. The knee stabilizing effect of the PCL is realized through specific function of each bundle and their mutual support. Theoretically, the function of native PCL can only be restored through double-bundle reconstruction, with the anterolateral (AL) bundle stabilizing the knee at flexion and the posteromedial (PM) bundle at knee extension. Biomechanically, double-bundle PCL reconstruction can restore knee stability to a better status than single-bundle PCL reconstruction [2]. However, clinical study indicated that no difference could be found between single and double-bundle PCL reconstruction regarding functional and stability evaluation [3]. The reason why double-bundle PCL reconstruction obtained a more stable knee in biomechanical testing than single-bundle PCL reconstruction, but similar phenomenon could not be found in clinical studies, should be due to that ultra-strong PCL reconstruction is not performed and graft relaxation and weakening occurs in both single-bundle and double-bundle reconstruction condition. However, whether the advantage of double bundle PCL reconstruction can be revealed in ultra-strong PCL reconstruction should be further studied. ?

From the beginning of the design of this procedure, the focus of ACL reconstruction is on how to protect the reconstructed structure from excessive stretching during normal range of motion of the knee, instead of how to make it to take the greatest effect. In the classic procedure of isometric ACL reconstruction with bone?patella tendon?bone graft, the femoral tunnel is located at a position as close as possible to the over-the-top position, and the tibial tunnel is located at the posterior part of the ACL footprint. However, clinical and biomechanical study revealed that isometric single-bundle ACL reconstruction failed to control rotational stability of the knee, related to high failure rates, and could not prevent the early onset of knee osteoarthritis. Thus, it seems that isometric ACL reconstruction should give place to anatomic ACL reconstruction. However, recent years of attempts of anatomic ACL reconstruction have failed to obtain obvious progress compared with isometric ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, some authors propose IDEAL position of the femoral tunnel in consideration of several aspects of ACL anatomy and biomechanics [1]. This special IDEAL position is almost the same position for isometric ACL reconstruction [2], which make the isometric ACL reconstruction interesting again (Fig. 14.1). ?

Design: Whole blood from 10 NGD and 10 GD, was refrigerated in CPD blood bags at 4øC for 42 days. Blood was analyzed before refrigeration (day 0) and at day 1 (d1), 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, 38, and 42. Multivariate linear mixed effects models were created to evaluate coagulation parameters over time and compare NGD and GD. Data are summarized as estimated marginal means with 95% confidence intervals. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Results: The PCT for all NGD CSWB was above the device limit by d7. The PLT for GD CSWB did not change during storage. The mean alpha-angle for INTEM and EXTEM decreased to <50% of baseline at d38 and d31 for NGD, and d31 and d17 for GD CSWB. The mean maximum clot firmness (MCF) for INTEM and EXTEM reduced to <50% of baseline at d42 and d28 for both GD and NGD. PT and aPTT for NGD and GD increased over time. For NGD CSWB, the mean FVIII and vWF:Ag activities decreased to <50% of baseline at d7 and d28, respectively, and FIB reached 0.982 g/dL by d24. For GD CSWB, FVIII, FXIII:Ag and FV activities decreased to <50% of baseline by d3, d38, and d38, respectively, and FIB was 0.982 g/dL at baseline. Alpha-angle and MCF for both INTEM and EXTEM, and activities for FII, FV, FIX, FXIII:Ag were significantly lower, and vWF:Ag was significantly higher overall in GD CSWB compared with NGD. A significant difference in the pattern of change over time was detected between NGD and GD in EXTEM alpha-angle, INTEM and EXTEM MCF, FII, and FVIII activities. Conclusions: The in vitro viscoelastic parameters of GD and NGD CSWB declines over 42 days, but numerous hemostatic parameters (INTEM and EXTEM alpha-angle and MCF, activity of FII, FV, FV, FVII, FIX, FX, FXIII:Ag, vWF:Ag, and FIB) remain within 50% of baseline for more than 14 days.

(2023),2023,"Achilles Tendon, Patellar Tendon, and Femoral Cartilage Thickness in Control vs Asymptomatic Flatfoot Young Adults","Background: Changes in lower extremity alignment in individuals with flatfoot may be associated with differences in morphology of the tendons or cartilage in lower extremities. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential association of flatfoot with the morphology of the Achilles tendon, patellar tendon, and femoral cartilage. Methods: This study was conducted with 40 participants with flatfoot (28 females, 12 males) and 40 participants with a normal foot posture (28 females, 12 males). The thickness of the Achilles tendon (at points 2 and 3 cm proximal to the superior aspect of the calcaneus), patellar tendon (at the inferior pole of the patella and 1 cm proximal of the inferior pole of the patella), and femoral cartilage (at the intercondylar area, medial condyle, and lateral condyle) was measured by an ultrasonography device. Results: The Achilles tendon thickness at 2 cm (P =.009) and 3 cm (P =.010) proximal of the superior aspect of the calcaneus was on average 4% to 6% lower in individuals with flatfoot compared with controls. The cartilage thickness at the intercondylar area (P =.005) and medial condyle (P =.018) was on average 8% to 12% greater in individuals with flatfoot; however, the cartilage thickness at the lateral condyle and patellar tendon thickness was similar in both groups. Conclusion: The results obtained suggest that foot posture is associated with the morphology of the Achilles tendon and femoral cartilage.

1014,SC-397,Luo et al. (2023),2023,Optimization of surgical exposure for harvesting gracilis-semitendinosus tendons,"Purpose: This study was conducted to provide anatomical data and surface markers for the safe and efficient exposure of surgical incisions for harvesting gracilis tendons (GT) and semitendinosus tendons (STT) while avoiding technical pitfalls and nerve injury during harvest for ligament reconstruction. Methods: Seventy-four Chinese cadaveric lower limbs were dissected to expose the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve (IPBSN) and pes anserinus (PA). Measurements of the borders and accessory bands of the PA tendons were taken. The arrangement of PA tendons and distribution of the IPBSN were assessed. Results: The PA was roughly shaped like a quadrangle, with its superior border at the horizontal plane of the tibial tuberosity (TT). The GT and STT bifurcation point was located on the medial border of the PA. From medial side to lateral side, the sartorius tendons (ST), GT, and STT fused gradually and formed the lateral border of the PA at the distal end. The tendon arrangement of theÿPA was primarily affected by ST, which commonly covered GT and STT completely. Variant tendons were found in 41.9% of specimens. The insertion of the accessory bands was distal but close to the inferior border of theÿPA. Accessory bands were observed only in STT and ST, and STT accounted for the most. The width of the first accessory band of STT was similar to the width of the STT. Additionally, most of the IPBSNs were proximal to the horizontal plane of the TT. Conclusion: For clearly exposing the GT and STT, it is crucial to expose the GT and STT bifurcation point on the medial border of the PA, whether directly or indirectly through the incision.The influence of ST insertion and the variability of tendons within the PA must be paid attention to during the operation. To protect IPBSNs highly, the incision should not beÿhigher than the TT level. ? 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to SICOT aisbl.",Scopus,10.1007/s00264-022-05598-5,International Orthopaedics
1015,SC-398,Kim et al. (2023),2023,Lower limb alignment in patients with primary valgus ankle arthritis: A comparative analysis with patients with varus ankle arthritis and healthy controls,"Background: While it is commonly acknowledged that the combined effect of lower limb orientation and ankle and hindfoot alignment play a fundamental role in ankle arthritis, supramalleolar/lower limb alignment has received less attention in valgus ankle arthritis. The purpose of this study was to analyze the lower limb alignment of patients with valgus ankle arthritis with primary origin, compared to that of varus ankle arthritis and normal controls. We hypothesized that patients with valgus ankle arthritis would have the opposite pattern of lower limb alignment as those with varus ankle arthritis. Methods: A retrospective radiographic analysis was performed on 61 patients (62 ankles, mean age, 59.3 ñ 12 years) with primary valgus ankle arthritis. On preoperative radiographs, seven parameters, including talar tilt angle, medial distal tibial angle (MDTA), talar center migration, anterior distal tibial angle, talo-first metatarsal (Meary's) angle, hindfoot moment arm (HMA), and mechanical axis deviation (MAD), were measured and compared to those of primary varus ankle arthritis (n = 55; mean age, 59.7 ñ 8.1 years) and control patients (n = 59; mean age, 29.3 ñ 7.3 years). Results: The valgus group had a significantly lower mean MDTA than the control group (p < 0.0001), indicating a varus distal tibial plafond in comparison to the control group. Meary's angle and HMA were significantly lower in the valgus group compared to the varus group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001, respectively), indicating a lower medial longitudinal arch and valgus hindfoot alignment. On whole limb radiographs, the valgus group showed a greater MAD than the control group, indicating varus lower limb alignment (p < 0.05). However, the MAD did not differ significantly between the valgus and varus groups (p = 0.7031). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that a significant proportion of ankles with primary valgus arthritis have a varus tibial plafond and a varus lower limb mechanical axis. This study contributes to our understanding of primary valgus ankle arthritis and suggests that lower limb alignment should be analyzed and considered throughout valgus ankle arthritis realignment procedures. ? 2022 European Foot and Ankle Society",Scopus,10.1016/j.fas.2022.09.008,Foot and Ankle Surgery
1016,SC-399,Zaid et al. (2023),2023,Clinical and arthroscopic outcomes of single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autologous hamstrings augmented with ligament augmentation and reconstruction systems compared with four-strand hamstring tendon grafts alone,"Purpose: To compare the clinical, radiological, and second-look arthroscopic outcomes in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a four-strand hamstring tendon graft (hamstring group) either without augmentation or with ligament augmentation and reconstruction system (LARS) augmentation (LARS augmentation group). Methods: From January 2018 to December 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were undertaken pre-operatively and at three, six, 12, and 24ÿmonths post-operatively. Arthroscopic evaluation was performed focusing on the morphology of the graft based on graft tension, graft tear, and synovial coverage. Results: A total of 178 consecutive patients received single-bundle ACL reconstruction, 89 patients in each group, and 20 patients were lost to follow-up in the first twoÿyears. At the threeÿmonth follow-up, the LARS augmentation group had significantly higher Lysholm scores, IKDC scores, and KOS-ADLS scores than the hamstring group (P < 0.001). At the three, six and 12-month follow-ups, there were significantly higher Tegner scores and ACL-RSI scores in the LARS augmentation group than in the hamstring group (P < 0.05). At the three and sixÿmonth follow-ups, the LARS augmentation group had significantly higher rates of return to sports and return to sports at their preinjury level (P < 0.05). There were no between-group differences in other outcomes, including arthroscopic outcomes, graft signal intensity, post-operative complications or rerupture rates. Conclusions: Autologous hamstring augmented with the LARS augmentation technique provides good and realistic clinical and functional results during the early post-operative period with high levels of satisfaction of patients, including participation in sports and physical activity, and high rates of return to sports at the preinjury level, without any apparent complications compared with hamstring ACL reconstruction alone. No increases in complication, reinjury rates, or increased lateral laxity were observed at the 12-month or 24-month follow-up. ? 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to SICOT aisbl.",Scopus,10.1007/s00264-022-05588-7,International Orthopaedics
1017,SC-400,Takeno et al. (2023),2023,Within- and Between-Session Reliability of Corticospinal Excitability in the Upper Extremity,"Reliable techniques to assess centrally mediated function in healthy individuals are essential to understand the origins of neuromuscular dysfunction in pathologic populations. This study examined the test?retest reliability of corticospinal excitability in the upper extremity musculature of 21 healthy individuals using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Within-session reliability was assessed by comparing tests performed 120ÿminutes apart. Between-session reliability was assessed by comparing the second (24 hr), third (1-week), and forth (2-week) sessions to the first test. We recorded active motor threshold (AMT) and motor evoked potential (MEP) at 120% AMT of the upper trapezius (UT), middle deltoid (MD), and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) bilaterally. Intraclass correlation coefficients (3,1) were used to assess relative reliability, and minimal detectable changes at 95% confidence level were calculated to assess absolute reliability. Our results suggest that AMT of the MD and FCR demonstrated acceptable within-session and between-session reliability over 24ÿhours, with all muscles evaluated ranging from moderate to good over 2ÿweeks. In contrast, MEP amplitudes were less reliable for all muscles, with reliability point estimates ranging from poor to moderate. AMT appears to be a more consistent measure of corticospinal excitability in upper extremity musculature, which may be more appropriate in clinical outcomes research. ? 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Scopus,10.1080/1091367X.2022.2070434,Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science

(2023),2023,Full-thickness peroneus longus tendon autograft for anterior cruciate reconstruction in multi-ligament injury and revision cases: outcomes and donor site morbidity,"Purpose: Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft has been successfully used for isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction cases. Being a powerful evertor and flexor of great toe, there might be associated ankle morbidity with this autograft option. However, there are only a few studies exploring whether the ankle morbidity is significant or not. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes, donor site morbidity, and ankle strength after harvesting ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction in revision ACL and multi-ligament injury cases. Methods: This was a prospective case series. All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS)ÿscore, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. Results: Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22?31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5?8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p = < 0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p = 0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.19), eversion strength(p = 0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p = 0.52), and AOFAS score(p = 0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients. Conclusions: Peroneus longus autograft can be considered as a potential autograft option for ACL reconstruction in multi-ligament knee injuries and revision ACL reconstruction. No significant donor site morbidity was noted at follow-up.

1019,SC-402,Akuzawa et al. (2023),2023,Contribution of the tibialis posterior and peroneus longus to inter-segment coordination of the foot during single-leg drop jump,"Abnormal foot motion is considered to be related to sports related injuries. This study aimed to identify the relationship between calf muscle activity and inter-segment coordination of the foot during single-leg drop jumps. Eleven healthy men participated and performed single-leg drop jumps from a 30-cm box. Muscle activity of the tibialis posterior (TP), flexor digitorum longus, peroneus longus (PL) and gastrocnemius were measured. The rearfoot and midfoot segment angle from landing to leaping were calculated according to the Rizzoli Foot Model and time scaled to 100%. A modified vector coding technique was employed to classify inter-segment coordination of every 1% into four patterns (in-phase, anti-phase, rearfoot phase,and midfoot phase). The relationship between percentage of each pattern and muscle activity levels were statistically analysed with correlation coefficient. The TP showed a significant positive correlation with percentage of in-phase in coronal plane (r =ÿ0.61, p =ÿ0.045). The PL also showed a trend of positive correlation to in-phase in coronal plane (r =ÿ0.59, p =ÿ0.058). TP and PL muscle activities may modulate the inter-segment coordination between the rearfoot and midfoot in coronal plane. Clinically, these muscles should be assessed for abnormal inter-segment foot motion. ? 2020 The Author(s).

MRI ??,"[Objective] To observe regenerative capacity of the residual peroneus longus tendon secondary to anterior half tendon harvested by magnetic resonance image. [Methods] A total of 19 patients had anterior half peroneus longus tendon harvested for single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Magnetic resonance examinations were performed regularly before operation, the next day after operation, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years after operation to obtain their magnetic resonance imaging data. The Dicom format images obtained were imported into RadiAnt DICOM Viewer software, and the tendon points were located using the software to obtain axial images at 2cm to the distal and proximal ends of the tendon harvested, and the cross-sectional area of the peroneus longus tendon was measured, Compared with the cross-sectional area of peroneus longus tendon at the same level before operation, its regeneration was analyzed. [Results] All the patients remained good continuity of the residual peroneus longus tendon without rupture on MRIs. At 3 months after operation, the residual ligament harvested at the proximal end regenerated rapidly, up to 85% of the original cross sectional area, while which at the distal end was also thickened. At 1 year after operation, the proximal and distal ends of the tendon harvested were thickened significantly, exceeding the preoperative level, and basically recovered to the preoperative level at 2 years after operation. [Conclusion] The residual peroneus longus tendon has a strong regenerative capacity, therefor the anterior half of the tendon is suitable tendon autograft for clinical needs. ? 2022 Orthopedic Journal of China.

1022,SC-405,Glten et al. (2022),2022,Comparison of acute hematologic responses of blood flow restriction training and resistance training in male fitness atheletes; Confronto delle risposte ematologiche acute nell?allenamento con restrizione del flusso sanguigno e nell?allenamento di resistenza negli atleti di fitness di sesso maschile,"BACKGROUND: High-intensity resistance training (HIRT) is recommended by The American College of Sports Medicine to improve muscle strength and hypertrophy. However, HIRT is not suitable for a significant portion of the population. If low-intensity resistance training (LIRT) is combined with blood flow restriction (BFR), it can improve muscle strength and hypertrophy and give similar results with HIRT. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of HIRT and BFR+LIRT training methods on hematological parameters after training and 24 hours after training. METHODS: Thirteen men who have been active fitness atheletes for at least 1 year voluntarily participated in the research. Participants applied adaptation training, HIRT and LIRT+BFR, respectively, on 3 separate days. LIRT+BFR trainings were applied with 30-15-15-15 repetitions at an intensity of 30% of 1 maximum repetition (1 RM), and HIRT at an intensity of 70-72.5-75% of 1 RM with 3 sets * 10 repetitions with one-minute intervals. A metronome was used to control muscle actions in 2 seconds concentric and 2 seconds eccentric. Venous blood was taken at the 0th minute before the training, immediately after the training and 24 hours after the training. RESULTS: When the two training methods are compared; no statistical difference was found in WBC, NEUT, LYMPH, MONO, IG, %NEUT, %LYMPH, %MONO, %IG, RBC, HGB, %HCT, PLT, MCV, %MacroR, %MicroR, MPV and PLCR parameters (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, LIRT+BFR seems to be a good alternative to HIRT, which gives similar results with HIRT, but puts less load on the joints and causes less pain and trauma due to exercise. ? 2022 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

1023,SC-406,Tran et al. (2022),2022,Stability of the knee after posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon graft with three femoral insertion sites. A cadaveric study,"Introduction: Many kinds of grafts were used for single-bundle reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Recently, the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) was used in some clinical reports. This study aimed to test the best position of the femoral insertion in the case of using PLT for PCL reconstruction. Methods: Seventeen fresh frozen cadaveric knees were randomized into three groups. Group AL (6 knees): the femoral insertion in PCL reconstruction was at the footprint center of the anterolateral bundle (ALB). Group PM (5 knees): at the footprint center of the posteromedial bundle (PMB). And group MC (6 knees) was at the midpoint of the center of the anterolateral bundle and posteromedial bundle. The PCL of all knees was cut and a PCL reconstruction procedure was performed with autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT). The stability of each knee was tested in three conditions: PCL was intact, PCL was resected, and PCL was reconstructed. The KT-1000 machine was used to measure the maximum posterior displacement of the tibia under force with the knees at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 degrees of flexion. Results: Average posterior displacement of the tibia under force for intact PCL of group AL was 1.6 mm, group MC was 1.2 mm, and group PM was 1.3 mm. After PCL was resected, the knee laxity was increased remarkably: posterior displacement of the tibia of group AL was 8.9 mm, group MC was 9.4 mm, and group PM was 13.6 mm. After PCL was reconstructed, group AL was 1.5 mm, group MC was 2.0 mm, and group PM was 5.6 mm. The results showed that after PCL reconstruction the group AL and group MC give better stability to the knee (p < 0.05, except knee at 120 degrees of flexion). Group AL got more stability than group MC, but the difference was not significant (p ò 0.164) Conclusion: In a single-bundle reconstruction of the PCL with the graft PLT, the femoral insertion at the footprint center of the ALB and the midpoint of the center of the ALB and PMB showed better stability than that at PMB. ? 2022 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11972,Heliyon

(2022),2022,Histological and biochemical evaluation of plasma rich in growth factors treatment for grade II muscle injuries in sheep,"The purpose of this study was to perform a histological and biochemical evaluation of the influence of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) on muscle regeneration process after a surgically induced grade II muscle laceration. A randomized, single blind, controlled experimental research was conducted including twenty-one adult healthy sheep, randomly divided in three groups (n = 7). A grade II surgical section was performed in the biceps femoris muscle of both hindlimbs. After two days (basal time), intralesional infiltration of autologous PRGF or Saline solution was randomly administered in both hindlimbs. Treatment was repeated once a week. Animal groups were euthanized at 1 (T1), 2 (T2) or 4 (T4) weeks. Histological assessment showed that PRGF intralesional injection induced a significant decrease of inflammatory cells density, significant higher centrally nucleated fibers percentage and significantly smaller fibrotic areas compared to Saline-treated muscles at T1, T2 and T4. Also, lower vascular density, with lower capillaries cross-sectional area, in PRGF group compared to Saline was observed. Biochemical analysis revealed a significant higher expression level of MYOD1, MYF5 and MYOG genes in PRGF groups at T1 compared to Saline treated muscles. At ultrastructural level, PRGF groups presented scarce edema and loss of connective tissue structure, as well as higher mitochondrial density adequately associated to the sarcomere unit in contrast to the Saline group. In conclusion, histological, biochemical, and ultrastructural results showed that PRGF treatment improved muscle regeneration process leading to more mature histological aspect in newly formed muscle tissue after a surgically induced grade II muscle injury. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s12917-022-03491-2,BMC Veterinary Research
1025,SC-408,Wu et al. (2022),2022,Effects of movement direction and limb dominance on ankle muscular force in sidestep cutting,"Sidestep cutting is a critical movement in sports. However, biomechanical research on sidestep cutting has not hitherto reached a consensus. In order to investigate the effects of limb dominance and movement direction on ankle and subtalar joints during sidestep cutting, twelve physically active male participants were recruited in the present study. Trajectory and ground reaction force data were collected by the motion capture system and force platform. Kinematics, kinetics, and muscle forces information were obtained by running OpenSim. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed with movement direction and limb dominance as independent variables. We found that movement direction had a significant effect on ankle dorsiflexion angle. In contrast, the factor of limb dominance had no effect on ankle and subtalar joints angles. For ankle joint moment, the plantarflexion moment was greater by performing a 45ø sidestep cutting or using the dominant limb, while the subtalar joint moment was not affected by these two variables. In terms of muscle forces, the soleus of the dominant limb generated greater plantarflexion muscle force on the sagittal plane, while the non-dominant limb tended to contract more strongly (peroneus longus and peroneus brevis) on the frontal plane to stabilize the subtalar joint. Meanwhile, a smaller sidestep cutting angle made participants generate greater plantarflexion muscle forces (soleus and gastrocnemius). In conclusion, our findings indicated that participants should take limb dominance and movement direction into consideration for enhancing athletic performance and reducing the risk of injury during sidestep cutting. ? 2022 IPEM",Scopus,10.1016/j.medengphy.2022.103914,Medical Engineering and Physics
1026,SC-409,Knapik et al. (2022),2022,Global variation in isolated posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Purpose: In the setting of persistent instability or failed non-operative management, surgical reconstruction is commonly recommended for isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears. The purpose of this study was to systematically review published studies to evaluate regional variation in the epidemiology of and surgical approaches to primary, isolated PCL reconstruction. Methods: A systematic review was performed in June 2022 to identify studies examining operative techniques during primary, isolated PCL reconstruction. Collected variables consisted of reconstruction technique, graft type, graft source, tibial reconstruction technique, femoral and tibial drilling and fixation methods, and whether the remnant PCL was preserved or debrided. Studies were classified into four global regions: Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Results: Forty-five studies, consisting of 1461 total patients, were identified. Most of the included studies were from Asia (69%, n = 31/45). Single bundle reconstruction was more commonly reported in studies out of Asia, Europe, and North America. Hamstring autografts were utilized in 51.7% (n = 611/1181) of patients from Asia and 60.8% (n = 124/204) of patients from Europe. Trans-tibial drilling and outside-in femoral drilling were commonly reported in all global regions. The PCL remnant was generally debrided, while remnant preservation was commonly reported in studies from Asia. Conclusion: Surgical treatment of isolated PCL injuries varies by region, with the majority of published studies coming from Asia. Single-bundle reconstruction with hamstring autograft through a trans-tibial approach is the most commonly reported technique in the literature, with males reported to undergo isolated reconstruction more often than females.

1027,SC-410,Hong et al. (2022),2022,A novel home-based rehabilitative knee brace system is a viable option for postoperative rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a report of 15 cases,"Purpose: To investigate the functional outcomes for patients who used a novel home-based rehabilitative system during the postoperative period after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions. Methods: Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction surgeries were prospectively enrolled. A home-based rehabilitation system, which is composed of a knee brace with a motion tracker, a mobile app, and a web portal, was applied. Patients could complete the rehabilitation exercise through the audio guidance and the real-time tracking system which displayed the achieved motions on the user interface of the app. Feedbacks from the patients, including the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, were collected and uploaded to the web portal. Each patient would meet a specialized physical therapist face-to-face once a month. At postoperative 6ÿmonths, every patient received a GNRB arthrometer examination and a Cybex isokinetic dynamometer examination. Results: A total of 15 patients (10 males and 5 females) were enrolled and followed for at least 6ÿmonths. The mean time of return to full knee extension was 1.5ÿmonths. The mean difference in laxity measured by GNRB arthrometer at 134ÿN significantly improved at postoperative 6ÿmonths (1.8 ñ 1.6ÿmm) compared to that measured preoperatively (3.4 ñ 1.9ÿmm) (p = 0.024). The peak torques of flexor and extensor muscles measured by Cybex isokinetic dynamometer remained unchanged at postoperative 6ÿmonths (p = 0.733 and 0.394, respectively). The patients? IKDC score became smaller at postoperative 1ÿmonth (p = 0.011) and significantly improved at postoperative 6ÿmonths (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Using a home-based rehabilitative knee brace system after ACL reconstruction is a viable option as patients maintained their knee muscle strengths maintained their muscle strength and achieve similar or better knee range of motion six months postoperatively. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s40634-022-00538-z,Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics

This study aims to provide an updated comparison of the clinical outcomes after stabilisation procedures using allografts and autografts, to correctly advise the clinician during the choice of the best material to be used for the reconstruction of the lateral ligamentous complex of the ankle. Methods: A systematic review was performed to analyse the use of autografts and allografts for anatomic reconstruction of the lateral ligamentous complex of the ankle in CAI patients. The presence of a postoperative assessment through outcome measures with proofs of validation in the CAI population or patient?s subjective evaluation on the treatment were necessary for inclusion. The quality of the included studies was assessed through the modified Coleman Methodology Score (mCMS). Relevant clinical outcome data were pooled to provide a synthetic description of the results in different groups or after different procedures. Results: Twenty-nine studies (autograft: 19; allograft: 9; both procedures: 1) accounting for 930 procedures (autograft: 616; allograft: 314) were included. The average mCMS was 55.9 ñ 10.5 points. The Karlsson-Peterson scale was the most frequently reported outcome scale, showing a cumulative average post- to preoperative difference of 31.9 points in the autograft group (n = 379, 33.8ÿmonths follow-up) and of 35.7 points in the allograft group (n = 227, 25.8ÿmonths follow-up). Patient satisfaction was good or excellent in 92.8% of autograft (n = 333, 65.2ÿmonths follow-up) and in 92.3% of allograft procedures (n = 153, 25.0ÿmonths follow-up). Return to activity after surgery and recurrence of instability were variably reported across the studies with no clear differences between allograft and autograft highlighted by these outcomes. Conclusions: The systematic analysis of validated CAI outcome measures and the patient?s subjective satisfaction does not support a specific choice between autograft and allograft for the reconstruction of the ankle lateral ligamentous complex in CAI patients. Both types of grafts were associated to a postoperative Karlsson?Peterson score superior to 80 points and to a similar rate of patient?s subjective satisfaction.

1029,SC-412,Farago et al. (2022),2022,Categorize the existing clamps used for tensile test of human graft? a systematic review,"Background: The use of tendon allografts for orthopedic repair has gained wide acceptance in recent years, most notably in anterior cruciate tendon reconstruction. Multiple studies support the use of tendon allografts and the benefits of its use are well accepted and understood. One of the important criteria of the use of tendon allografts is statistically similar histological and biomechanical properties to autographs. The aim of this systematic literature review is to investigate and categorize existing clamps used in the determination of the biomechanical properties of tendons such as maximum load, maximum strength, modulus of elasticity, ultimate strain, and stiffness. A variety of clamps for use during the endurance test of tendons were categorized according to the temperature used during the measurement. The clamps are divided into three groups: room temperature, cooled and heated clamps. The second goal of our review is to overview of clamps on the following aspects: name of clamp, author and date, type of clamps, type of endurance test (static or dynamic), type preloading (dynamic or static), type of tendon and measured and calculated parameters, and summarize in Tableÿ3, as a comprehensive catalogue. Methods: This systematic review was carried out in keeping with the PRISMA 2020 E&E and the PRISMA-S guidelines and checklists. A search was conducted for publications dating between 1991 and February 28th 2022 through three electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed). We used Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist to check the quality of included articles. Results: The database search and additional sources resulted in 1725 records. 1635 records eliminated during the screening for various reasons (case report, other languages, book chapter, unavailable text/conference abstract, unrelated topic). The number of articles used in the final synthesis was 90. A variety of clamps for use during the endurance test of tendons were identified and categorized according to the temperature used during the measurement. Based on this, the clamps are divided into three groups: room temperature, cooled or heated clamps. Conclusions: On the basis of the systematic literature review, mechanical parameters determined by usage with cooled clamps proved to be more reliable than with those at room temperature and with heated clamps. The collected information from the articles included name of clamp, author and date, type of clamps, type of endurance test (static or dynamic), type preloading (dynamic or static), type of tendon and measured and calculated parameters given in Tableÿ3. summarized. The main advantage of the cooled clamps is that there is no limit to the type and length of the tendon. This study provides an overview of clamps and does not represent the modernity of any method. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s12891-022-05650-w,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
1030,SC-413,Lee et al. (2022),2022,Reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligament with palmaris longus tendon and Mersilene tape for acromioclavicular dislocations,"Background: Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation is common among shoulder injuries, and various surgical methods have been introduced for effective ligament reconstruction. Reconstruction of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament in the anatomical position using autologous tendons is a recent surgical trend. This study is to report clinical and radiologic results of reconstruction of the CC ligament using an autologous palmaris longus tendon interweaved with Mersilene tape (PLMT) with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 76 patients (mean age, 43.4 ñ 11.2 years) with AC joint dislocation treated by reconstruction of the CC ligament with PLMT, from March 2004 to February 2017. The mean follow-up period was 28 ñ 6.7 months (range, 24?66 months). The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain assessment, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons rating scale (ASES), and Constant Score (CS) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes at the preoperative and the final follow-ups. CC and AC distances were measured using anteroposterior (AP) X-ray preoperatively and at the final follow-up for radiologic outcomes. Complications were also assessed. Results: The mean preoperative VAS for pain, ASES, CS were 5.7 ñ 0.7, 77.1 ñ 6.2, and 61.5 ñ 5.2, respectively. These scores at the final follow-up improved to 2.1 ñ 0.5, 90.9 ñ 4.3, and 94 ñ 7.0, respectively (p = 0.043, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). The mean preoperative CC and AC distances were 16.49 ñ 3.73 mm and 13.84 ñ 3.98 mm, respectively. The final follow-up CC and AC distances were 9.29 ñ 2.72 mm and 5.30 ñ 2.09 mm, respectively (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Although a slight re-widening of the CC distance occurred in 10 patients (13.1%), most patients regained full range of motion of the affected shoulder at the final follow-up. Conclusion: The CC ligament reconstruction with PLMT for the treatment of AC joint dislocation showed good clinical and radiological results. This technique could be a good alternative treatment for AC dislocations. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s12891-022-05589-y,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
1031,SC-414,Lu et al. (2022),2022,The promotive effect of grafts with the double-stranded peroneus longus tendon and with the four-stranded hamstring tendon on reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament injury,"Introduction: Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury hampers the rotational stability and stability front to back of the knee joint, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients. Some studies have reported that the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has sufficient length and strength. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the PLT can be used as a novel appropriate material for PCL reconstruction therapy. Materials and methods: Herein, we systematically analysed the clinical effect of the double-stranded PLT and the four-stranded hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the PCL and compared the effectiveness and safety of these two surgical approaches in the reconstruction of PCL injury. A total of 48 patients with complete rupture of the PCL were divided into Group A (reconstructed with the double-stranded PLT, 25 cases) and Group B (reconstructed with the four-stranded hamstring tendon, 23 cases). Results: The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The intraoperative time for tendon extraction was significantly shorter in Group A than Group B. Twenty-four months after operation, patients in the two groups showed the alleviated tibial posterior displacement and the increased IKDC score, Lysholm score and Tegner score. Nevertheless, these scores showed no significant differences between the two groups. Additionally, compared with the therapy using the four-stranded hamstring tendon, therapy using the double-stranded PLT is simpler and safer. Discussion: Both surgical methods are effective in the treatment of PCL injury. The PLT could be a good choice for PCL injury reconstruction material, especially when the four-stranded hamstring tendon is accidentally damaged or ineffective. Our study may provide guidance for the clinical treatment of PCL injury.

1032,SC-415,Schtzenberger et al. (2022),2022,ACL reconstruction with femoral and tibial adjustable versus fixed-loop suspensory fixation: a retrospective cohort study,"Background: Cortical suspensory fixation (CSF) devices gain more and more popularity as a reliable alternative to interference screws for graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Adjustable-loop fixation may be associated with increased anterior laxity and inferior clinical outcome. The purpose of the study was to compare anterior laxity and clinical outcome after minimally invasive all-inside ACL reconstruction using an adjustable-loop (AL) to a standard technique with a fixed-loop (FL) CSF device. Methods: Patients who underwent primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction with a quadrupled hamstring autograft at a single institution between 2012 and 2016 were reviewed. In the AL group minimally invasive popliteal tendon harvesting was performed with an all-inside approach (femoral and tibial sockets). In the FL group a traditional anteromedial approach was used for tendon harvesting and a femoral socket and full tibial tunnel were drilled. An objective clinical assessment was performed with Telos x-rays and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Objective Score. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) included the IKDC Subjective Score, the Lysholm Knee Score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS) and the Tegner Activity Scale. Results: A total of 67 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study with a mean follow-up of 4 (ñ 1.5) years. The groups were homogenous at baseline regarding age, gender, and the time to surgery. At follow-up, no statistically significant differences were found regarding anterior laxity (AL: 2.3 ñ 3ÿmm vs. FL: 2.3 ñ 2.6ÿmm, p = 0.981). PRO scores were comparable between the AL and FL groups (IKDC score, 84.8 vs. 88.8, p = 0.185; Lysholm 87.3 vs. 89.9, p = 0.380; KOOS 90.7 vs. 91.4, p = 0.720; Tegner 5.5 vs. 6.2, p = 0.085). The rate of saphenous nerve lesions was significantly lower in the AL group with popliteal harvesting of the tendon (8.3% vs. 35.5%, p = 0.014). Conclusion: The use of an adjustable-loop device on the femoral and tibial side led to similar stability and clinical results compared to a fixed-loop device. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s13018-022-03128-y,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research
1033,SC-416,Tajdini et al. (2022),2022,Inter-limb asymmetry of kinetic and electromyographic during walking in patients with chronic ankle instability,"After an initial ankle sprain, a relevant number of participants develop chronic ankle instability (CAI). Compensatory strategies in patients with CAI may change the inter-limb symmetry needed for absorbing movement-related forces. Accordingly, an increased risk of injury can occur. The present study aimed to compare the inter-limb asymmetry of kinetic and electromyography between individuals with CAI and without a history of an ankle sprain (Non-CAI) during walking. In this cross-sectional study, fifty-six athletes (28 CAI; 28 Non-CAI) participated. Participants walked at a comfortable pace over level ground while vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and muscle activity of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial gastrocnemius, and gluteus medius were recorded. Inter-limb asymmetry during walking was calculated for each of the variables. Patients with CAI exhibited a greater inter-limb asymmetry of the first peak of vGRF, time to peak vGRF, and loading rate (P < 0.001), as well as presenting a greater inter-limb asymmetry of peroneus longus activity (contact phase) (P = 0.003) and gluteus medius activity (midstance/propulsion phase) (P = 0.010) compared to the Non-CAI group. No other differences in vGRF or muscles activity were observed between the groups. Our findings indicate that patients with CAI walk with greater inter-limb asymmetry in vGRF and muscleÿactivity in different phases of the gait cycle compared to Non-CAI group. Our results could inform future studies on gait training aimed to reduce asymmetry during walking in patients with CAI. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-022-07975-x,Scientific Reports
1034,SC-417,Migliorini et al. (2022),2022,Single versus double bundle in posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction: a meta-analysis,"Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction can be performed using single bundle (SB) and double bundle (DB) techniques. The present study investigated whether DB PCL reconstruction is superior to SB reconstruction in terms of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and joint stability. In December 2021 Embase, Google Scholar, Pubmed, Scopus databases were accessed. All clinical trials comparing SB versus DB reconstruction to address PCL insufficiency in skeletally mature patients were considered. Data from 483 procedures were retrieved. The mean follow-up was 31.0 (28.0 to 107.6) months, and the mean timespan between injury and surgery was 11.3 (6 to 37) months. The mean age of the patients was 29.3 ñ 3.8ÿyears. 85 of 483 patients (18%) were women. At a mean of 31.0ÿmonths post reconstruction, ROM (P = 0.03) was slightly greater in the SB group, while the Tegner score (P = 0.03) and the Telos stress (P = 0.04) were more favorable in the DB cohort. Similarity was found in instrumental laxity (P = 0.4) and Lysholm score (P = 0.3). The current evidence does not support the use of DB techniques for PCL reconstruction. Both methods could restore knee stability and motion with satisfactory short term patient reported outcome measures. Further high quality clinical trials are required to validate these results on a larger scale. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-022-07976-w,Scientific Reports
1035,SC-418,Akuzawa et al. (2022),2022,Difference in the foot intersegmental coordination pattern between female lacrosse players with and without a history of medial Tibial stress syndrome; a cross-sectional study,"Background: Medial tibial stress syndrome is a common sports related injury. Altered foot kinematics can be a risk factor for the injury. Since foot segments can move independently, intersegment coordination is important for proper foot function. This study aimed to compare the foot intersegmental coordination pattern and single segment kinematics between female lacrosse players with and without a history of medial tibial stress syndrome during drop jump. Methods: Twelve players with a medial tibial stress syndrome history and 12 players with no history were enrolled. Foot kinematics, including angle at landing and peak angle and excursion at the rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot during single-leg drop jumps were analysed. Each segment motion data from landing to leaping was time-scaled to 100% to analyse the intersegmental coordination with a modified vector coding technique. Instant intersegmental coordination of every 1% was classified into four patterns (in-phase, two segments rotate in the same direction with similar amplitudes; anti-phase, two segments rotate in opposite directions; proximal phase, proximal segment dominantly rotates in the same direction compared to the distal segment; and distal phase, distal segment dominantly rotates in the same direction compared to the proximal segment). The percentage of intersegmental coordination pattern and kinematics in each segment were compared between the groups using the Student?s t test. Results: Groups with a history of medial stress syndrome showed a significantly higher percentage of proximal phase between the rearfoot and midfoot in the sagittal (Mean ñ SD; history, 52.2 ñ 17.9%, no history, 29.3 ñ 16.7%; p = 0.004) and coronal planes (history, 40.3 ñ 22.0%, no history, 15.9 ñ 9.1%; p = 0.004). Dorsiflexion excursion (history, 34.5 ñ 4.5ø, no history, 29.6 ñ 2.1ø; p = 0.003) were significantly larger in a history of medial tibial stress syndrome group compared to no history group. Conclusions: Rearfoot dominant motion pattern relative to the midfoot may be related to medial tibial stress syndrome. Intersegmental coordination analysis may be useful for detecting abnormal foot coordination patterns. Also, stabilization for the rearfoot may be required rather than the midfoot for intervention. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s13047-022-00513-y,Journal of Foot and Ankle Research

Methods A total of 220 patients with KOA in our hospital, between June 2020 and April 2022, were enrolled and randomly divided into observation group (n = 110) and the control (n = 110). The observation group was given PRP injection combined with pregabalin, while control group was given sodium hyaluronate combined with pregabalin. The clinical curative effect, osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), pain level (VAS), knee function [Lysholm-? scale, Rasmussen scale], levels of repair-promoting factors [transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1)], inflammatory factors [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor à (TNF-à)], oxidative stress indexes [ superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO)] and blood routine [white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (Plt)], and the occurrence of adverse reactions in the two groups were compared. Results The response rate of treatment was higher in observation group than control group [94.55% (104 / 110) vs 83.64% (92 / 110), P<0.05]. After treatment, scores of WOMAC and VAS were lower in observation group than the control group [points:43.39ñ5.92 vs 49.40ñ6.18, 2.50ñ0.33 vs 2.87ñ0.39, P<0.05], and scores of Rasmussen and Lysholm-? were higher in observation group [points 60.66ñ6.15 vs 55.13ñ5.49, 77.04ñ6.18 vs 72.15ñ7.25, P<0.05]. After treatment, levels of serum TGF-?1, BMP4 and IGF-1 were higher in observation group than control group [(944.80ñ54.92) ng / L vs (901.45ñ46.82) ng / L, (126.79ñ9.81) pg / mL vs (118.44ñ8.45) pg / mL, (96.86ñ5.15) ?g / L vs (91.47ñ5.06) ?g / L, P< 0. 05].

The levels of peripheral blood WBC and PLT in the two groups were similar after treatment (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05).

Considering the drawbacks of other autografts, we analyse peroneus longus autograft holistically as a viable alternative. Materials and methods: This was a prospective study of 113 patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft between January 2017 and November 2018 for isolated, full-thickness ACL tears. Functional analysis was done using the Tegner-Lysholm score pre-operatively, at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postoperatively. At terminal follow-up, stability was checked clinically by Lachman test, residual morbidity of donor site was assessed using foot and ankle disability index, and radiographic correlation was done with magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The mean diameter of the graft after tripling was 9 ñ 0.71 mm and the average length before tripling was found to be 27.07 ñ 2.76 cms. At terminal follow-up, 101 patients showed excellent, while 12 patients showed good outcomes. The mean foot and ankle disability index was 94.8 ñ 3. 90.27% of patients had no laxity on clinical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging of all the patients at terminal follow-up showed good graft uptake. Conclusions: Peroneus longus autograft shows intraoperative consistency and gives excellent functional outcome, clinical stability, and no donor site morbidity even three years postoperatively. ? 2022 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation",Scopus,10.1016/j.jor.2022.08.027,Journal of Orthopaedics

Methods A total of 106 patients with ACL injury who underwent ACL reconstruction from May 2016 to May 2019 in the 987M Hospital of PLA Joint Logistics Support Force were selected as the research objects,and the patients were divided into the peroneus longus tendon group (n =56) and the hamstring tendon group (n=50) according to the graft material. The patients in the peroneus longus tendon group were treated with ACL reconstruction using autologous peroneus longus tendon transplantation, and the patients in the hamstring tendon group were treated with ACL reconstruction using autologous peroneus longus tendon transplantation. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, drainage volume within 24 hours after operation and hospitalization time of patients in the two groups were recorded. Before operation and 6 months after operation,the knee joint function of patients in the two groups was evaluated by the Lysholm scale;the knee joint movement function of patients in the two groups was evaluated by the Tegner knee joint movement score. The incidence of complications of patients during postoperative hospitalization in the two groups was recorded,and the incidence of complications was calculated. Results The operation time of the patients in the peroneus longus tendon group was significantly longer than that in the hamstring tendon group (P < 0. 05 ). There was no significant difference in intraoperative blood loss, drainage volume within 24 hours after operation and the hospitalization time of patients between the peroneus longus tendon group and the hamstring tendon group ( P > 0. 05). Before operation, there was no significant difference in the Lysholm scale of claudication, support, twist, instability, swelling degree, ability to go upstairs, ability to squat, pain degree scores and total score of patients between the two groups ( P > 0. 05 ). The claudication,support,hinge,instability, degree of swelling, ability to go upstairs, ability to squat, degree of pain scores and the total score in the Lysholm scale of patients in the two groups after 6 months of operation were significantly higher than those before operation (P <0. 05) ; after 6 months of operation, the claudication, support, instability, squatting ability scores and total score in the Lysholm score of patients in the peroneus longus tendon group were significantly higher than those in the hamstring tendon group (P <0. 05 ). Before operation, there was no significant difference in the Tegner score of patients between the two groups ( P > 0. 05) ; the Tegner scores of patients in the two groups after 6 months of operation were significantly higher than those before operation (P<0.05) ; after 6 months of operation, the Tegner score of patients in the peroneus longus tendon group was significantly higher than that in the hamstring tendon group (P<0. 05). The incidence of postoperative complication in the hamstring tendon group and the peroneus tendon group were 2. 00% ( 1/56) and 5. 36% (3/56), respectively; there was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complication of patients between the two groups (% = 1. 037 ,P >0. 05 ). Conclusion Compared with the hamstring tendon, the peroneus longus tendon for ACL reconstruction in patients with ACL injury has longer operation time, but the postoperative recovery of knee joint function, especially the knee joint motor function is better,and the incidence of postoperative complications is not increased. ?

1042,SC-425,Blasimann et al. (2022),2022,Neuromuscular Control During Stair Descent and Artificial Tibial Translation After Acute ACL Rupture,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture has direct effect on passive and active knee stability and, specifically, stretch-reflex excitability. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to investigate neuromuscular activity in patients with an acute ACL deficit (ACL-D group) compared with a matched control group with an intact ACL (ACL-I group) during stair descent and artificially induced anterior tibial translation. It was hypothesized that neuromuscular control would be impaired in the ACL-D group. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), and semitendinosus (ST) muscles was recorded bilaterally in 15 patients with ACL-D (mean, 13.8 days [range, 7-21 days] since injury) and 15 controls with ACL-I during stair descent and artificially induced anterior tibial translation. The movements of stair descent were divided into preactivity, weight acceptance, and push-off phases. Reflex activity during anterior tibial translation was split into preactivity and short, medium, and late latency responses. Walking on a treadmill was used for submaximal EMG normalization. Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc analyses with Dunn-Bonferroni correction were used to compare normalized root mean square values for each muscle, limb, movement, and reflex phase between the ACL-D and ACL-I groups. Results: During the preactivity phase of stair descent, the hamstrings of the involved leg of the ACL-D group showed 33% to 51% less activity compared with the matched leg and contralateral leg of the ACL-I group (P <.05). During the weight acceptance and push-off phases, the VL revealed a significant reduction (approximately 40%) in the involved leg of the ACL-D group compared with the ACL-I group. At short latency, the BF and ST of the involved leg of the ACL-D group showed a significant increase in EMG activity compared with the uninvolved leg of the ACL-I group, by a factor of 2.2 to 4.6. Conclusion: In the acute phase after an ACL rupture, neuromuscular alterations were found mainly in the hamstrings of both limbs during stair descent and reflex activity. The potential role of prehabilitation needs to be further studied. ? The Author(s) 2022.",Scopus,10.1177/23259671221123299,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine

Case histories, clinical manifestations, intraoperative findings, surgical treatment methods, and treatment outcomes were evaluated to characterize fistula-associated cysts. The clinical results were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot functional scores, preoperatively and at the last follow-up. (3) Results: The main complaints were ankle instability and pain (15 patients), pain only (15 patients), instability (seven patients), and cosmetic problems (three patients). Eleven patients had a cyst with an open skin wound, and eight of these patients had undergone surgery under a misdiagnosis of bursitis. Cysts were located anterior to the lateral malleolus in 22 cases, next to the lateral malleolus in 13 cases, posterior to the lateral malleolus in three cases, and across the entire lateral malleolus in two cases. Mean VAS and AOFAS scores improved from 5.2 (range, from 1 to 7) and 72.3 (range, from 65 to 87) preoperatively to 1.1 (range, from 0 to 3) and 93.6 (range, from 85 to 100), respectively, at final follow-up visits. (4) Conclusions: Cyst occurrence due to a synovial fistula should be considered when treating a cyst around the lateral malleolus. Fistula repair and reinforcement with fibular periosteum provides a good treatment option for cysts attributed to synovial fistula of the ankle that fail to respond to conservative treatment. ? 2022 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/jcm11206215,Journal of Clinical Medicine

(2022),2022,"Modulation of Lower-Limb Muscle Activity in Maintaining Unipedal Balance According to Surface Stability, Sway Direction, and Leg Dominance","Determining temporal similarity in shape between electromyographic (EMG) and center-of-pressure (COP) signals reflects neuromuscular control in terms of which relevant muscles are involved in maintaining balance. The current study aimed to investigate a cross-correlation between seven lower-limb EMG activities and COP displacements, simultaneously measured in 25 young adults unipedally balancing on stable and multiaxial-unstable surfaces. The effect of surface stability, sway direction, and leg dominance was then tested on two EMG?COP correlation levels: individual muscles and groups (patterns) of multi-muscles involved in postural sway, as determined by principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that two factors demonstrate their effects only at the level of individual muscles: sway direction (p ó 0.003) and leg dominance (p = 0.003). Specifically, the semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and soleus correlate more with the mediolateral postural sway than with the anteroposterior postural sway, except for the gastrocnemius medialis. Additionally, balancing on the non-dominant leg shows a lower correlation between the semitendinosus and postural sway than on the dominant leg. The current findings suggest that when achieving unipedal equilibrium, the postural control system may be constrained the most in the specific muscles of the least steady conditions, e.g., the frontal plane and non-preferred leg. ? 2022 by the author.",Scopus,10.3390/sports10100155,Sports
1045,SC-428,Ganapam et al. (2022),2022,Anterior-cruciate-ligament reconstruction does not alter the knee-extensor moment arm during gait,"Background: The ability of the quadriceps muscles to extend the knee depends on the moment arm of the knee-extensor mechanism, which is described by the moment arm of the patellar tendon at the knee. The knee-extensor moment may be altered by a change in quadriceps force, a change in the patellar tendon moment arm (PTMA), or both. A change in quadriceps muscle strength after anterior-cruciate-ligament-reconstruction (ACLR) surgery is well documented, however, there is limited knowledge about how this procedure affects the PTMA. Research question: Does ACLR surgery alter the moment arm of the knee-extensor mechanism during gait? Methods: We measured the PTMA in both the ACLR knee and the uninjured contralateral knee in 10 young active individuals after unilateral ACLR surgery. Mobile biplane X-ray imaging was used to measure the three-dimensional positions of the femur, tibia and patella during level walking and downhill walking over ground. The PTMA was found from the location of the instantaneous axis of rotation at the knee and the line-of-action of the patellar tendon. Results: There was a small but statistically significant difference in the mean PTMA calculated over one cycle of level walking between the ACLR knee and the contralateral knee, with the mean PTMA in the ACLR knee being 1.5 mm larger (p < 0.01). In downhill walking, statistically significant differences were found in the range 15ø? 25ø of knee flexion, where the PTMA was 4.7 mm larger in the ACLR knee compared to the contralateral knee (p < 0.01). Significance: Significant differences were evident in the mean PTMA between the ACLR knee and the contralateral knee in both activities, however, the magnitudes of these differences were relatively small (range: 3?10%), indicating that ACLR surgery successfully restores the moment arm of the knee-extensor mechanism during dynamic activity. ? 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2022.09.074,Gait and Posture
1046,SC-429,Pandey et al. (2022),2022,Trends in Primary Anatomical Single-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Practice in Adult Patients Prevalent Among Arthroscopy Surgeons of Six Southern States of India,"Background: Although guidelines from multiple scientific studies decide the general trend in ACLR practice, there is often a variation between scientific guidelines and actual practice. Methods: A 17-member committee comprised of sports surgeons with experience of a minimum of 10ÿyears of arthroscopy surgery finalized a survey questionnaire consisting of concepts in ACL tear management and perioperative trends, intraoperative and post-operative practices regarding single-bundle anatomic ACLR. The survey questionnaire was mailed to 584 registered sports surgeons in six states of south India. A single, non-modifiable response was collected from each member and analyzed. Results: 324 responses were received out of 584 members. A strong consensus was present regarding Hamstring tendons preference for ACLR, graft diameter ò 7.5ÿmm, viewing femoral footprint through the anterolateral portal, drilling femoral tunnel from anteromedial portal guided by ridges and remnants of femoral footprint using a freehand technique, suspensory devices to fix the graft in femur and interference screw in the tibia and post-operative bracing. A broad consensus was achieved in using a brace to minimize symptoms of instability of an ACL tear and antibiotic soaking of graft. There was no consensus regarding the timing of ACLR, preferred graft in athletes, pre-tensioning, extra-articular procedure, and return to sports. There was disagreement over hybrid tibial fixation and suture tapes to augment graft. Conclusion: Diverse practices continue to prevail in the management of ACL injuries. However, some of the consensuses reached in this survey match global practices. Contrasting or inconclusive practices should be explored for potential future research. ? 2022, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1007/s43465-022-00719-z,Indian Journal of Orthopaedics
1047,SC-430,Gonera et al. (2022),2022,Embryological approach to the morphology of the ligamentum mucosum of the human knee joint,"Purpose: The ligamentum mucosum is a ligamentous structure within the synovial layer of the knee joint capsule. It usually arises from the infrapatellar fat pad and is inserted into the intercondylar notch of the femur. In recent years, more attention has been paid to this structure because of its clinical significance. Despite the growing attention, the complex morphology of the ligamentum mucosum has led to many misunderstandings among the scientists and clinicians. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to characterize the morphology of the ligamentum mucosum and its attachment points, classify it, and evaluate its prevalence. Methods: Classical anatomical dissection was performed on 70 lower limbs of human fetuses fixed in 10% formalin solution. Morphology was carefully assessed, and morphometric measurements were performed. The types revealed were classified. Results: The ligamentum mucosum was present in 100% of all 70 specimens examined. Two types were detected. Type I (65.71%) - ""cord-like"". This type was the most common and is characterized by a single longitudinal ligament. The proximal attachment of the ligamentum mucosum was located in the middle of the infrapatellar fat, and the distal attachment was at the tip of the intercondylar notch. Type II (34.29%) - ""vertical septum"". This type is less common, but its morphology is much more complex compared to type I. It is wider and thicker than type I. Proximally, it is attached to the infrapatellar fat pad and distally through the entire intercondylar notch down to the anterior surface of the anterior cruciate ligament. It divides the joint cavity into medial and lateral sides. Conclusion: The ligamentum mucosum exhibits high morphologic variability, and the view that it is a vestigial remnant of the embryologic development of the knee should be reconsidered. We have proposed an anatomical classification of its types in human fetuses, which is a valuable addition to existing knowledge and will hopefully change the approach of clinicians and scientists. ? 2022",Scopus,10.1016/j.aanat.2022.151983,Annals of Anatomy

(2022),2022,The Effect of Kinesio Taping on the Feedforward Activity of the Lower Limb Muscles in Elite Volleyball Players With and Without Chronic Ankle Instability Performing Single-leg Jump-landing,"Purpose: The current research aims to examine the effect of taping on the feedforward activity of the lower limb muscles in elite volleyball players with and without chronic ankle instability while performing single-leg jump-landing. Methods: The electromyographic activities of the lateral gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, rectus femoris, gluteus medius, and vastus lateralis of the non-dominant leg were registered before and after taping in 26 volleyball players while performing the spike skill with single-leg landing. These volleyball players entered the research by purposive sampling. The root mean square (RMS) was employed to compute muscle activity before and after taping. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test at Pó0.05 was utilized to analyze the data. Results: The results of the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test demonstrated that the groups did not have a significant factor in any of the variables in the feedforward phase, except for the maximum root mean square (RMS) of the peroneus longus muscle (P=0.01). Conclusion: The results showed that taping cannot improve the feedforward activity of the selected muscles during single-leg landing in people with chronic ankle instability. Therefore, it is recommended to use other methods and exercises to improve the muscle feedforward activity in these individuals during the rehabilitation phases. ? 2022, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences.

1049,SC-432,Ling et al. (2022),2022,A novel implantable mechanism-based tendon transfer surgery for adult acquired flatfoot deformity: Evaluating feasibility in biomechanical simulation,"Adult acquired flatfoot deformity becomes permanent with stage III posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction and results in foot pain and difficulty walking and balancing. To prevent progression to stage III posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction when conservative treatment fails, a flexor digitorum longus to posterior tibialis tendon transfer is often conducted. However, since the flexor digitorum longus only has one-third the force-capability of the posterior tibialis, an osteotomy is typically also required. We propose the use of a novel implantable mechanism to replace the direct attachment of the tendon transfer with a sliding pulley to amplify the force transferred from the donor flexor digitorum longus to the foot arch. In this work, we created four OpenSim models of an arched foot, a flatfoot, a flatfoot with traditional tendon transfer, and a flatfoot with implant-modified tendon transfer. Paired with these models, we developed a forward dynamic simulation of the stance phase of gait that reproduces the medial/lateral distribution of vertical ground reaction forces. The simulation couples the use of a fixed tibia, moving ground plane methodology with simultaneous activation of nine extrinsic lower limb muscles. The arched foot and flatfoot models produced vertical ground reaction forces with the characteristic double-peak profile of gait, and the medial/lateral distribution of these forces compared well with the literature. The flatfoot model with implantmodified tendon transfer produced a 94.2% restoration of the medial/lateral distribution of vertical ground reaction forces generated by our arched foot model, which also represents a 2.1X improvement upon our tendon transfer model. This result demonstrates the feasibility of a pulley-like implant to improve functional outcomes for surgical treatment of adult acquired flatfoot deformity with ideal biomechanics in simulation. The real-world efficacy and feasibility of such a device will require further exploration of factors such as surgical variability, soft tissue interactions and healing response. ? 2022 Ling, Balasubramanian.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of ALAS on the CV-SRP. We employed a cross-sectional study with two groups: ALAS (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30). The CV-SRP of the soleus, fibularis longus, and tibialis anterior was assessed using the H-index method. As secondary outcomes, H-reflex and M-wave latencies were assessed as well as acute symptoms including ankle swelling, pain, and self-reported ankle function. Separate group-by-limb ANOVA with repeated measures revealed a significant interaction for soleus CV-SRP (p < 0.001) and H-reflex latency (p < 0.001), showing significant slower CV-SRP and longer H-reflex latency in the involved limb of the ALAS group compared with both limbs in the control group. However, there was no significant interaction or main effect in any other ankle muscles (p > 0.05). A further correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between CV-SRP and acute symptoms, including ankle swelling (r = ?0.37, p = 0.048) and self-reported ankle function (r = 0.44, p = 0.017) in ALAS patients. These results suggest a disrupted functionality of the afferent pathway and/or synaptic transmission following ALAS.

1051,SC-434,Higashihara et al. (2022),2022,Differences in the recruitment properties of the corticospinal pathway between the biceps femoris and rectus femoris muscles,"The neuromuscular activity in the hamstring and quadriceps muscles is vital for rapid force control during athletic movements. This study aimed to investigate the recruitment properties of the corticospinal pathway of the biceps femoris long head (BFlh) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles. Thirty-two male subjects were participated in this study. Corticospinal excitability was investigated for BFlh and RF during the isometric knee flexion and extension tasks, respectively, using transcranial magnetic stimulation. A sigmoidal relationship was observed between the stimulus intensity and amplitude of motor-evoked potentials and characterized by a plateau value, maximum slope, and threshold. Compared with RF, BFlh had a significantly lower plateau value (P < 0.001, d = 1.17), maximum slope (P < 0.001, r = 0.79), and threshold (P = 0.003, d = 0.62). The results showed that the recruitment properties of the corticospinal pathway significantly differ between BFlh and RF. These results reveal that when a sudden large force is required during athletic movements, the RF can produce force through a rapid increase in the recruitment of motor units. The BFlh, on the other hand, requires larger or more synchronized motor commands for enabling the proper motor unit behavior to exert large forces. These differences in the neurophysiological factors between the hamstrings and quadriceps can have a substantial effect on the balance of force generation during athletic activities. ? 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.brainres.2022.147963,Brain Research
1052,SC-435,Dury et al. (2022),2022,Fatigue of hip abductor muscles implies neuromuscular and kinematic adaptations of the ankle during dynamic balance,"Objective: Determine whether hip abductor muscle fatigue influenced ankle kinematic and muscle activity during ankle-destabilized tasks. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Twenty-six healthy, active participants performed two tests (Star Excursion Balance Test, SEBT; Weight Bearing Inversion Test, WBIT) for assessment of dynamic balance and ability to control inversion. Participants were equipped with an ankle-destabilizing sandal in inversion and eversion to perform both tests, which were completed before and after a fatiguing exercise of hip abductor muscles (up to 50% reduction in strength). Electromyographic activity of peroneus longus (PL) and brevis (PB), tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius lateralis (GastL) and gluteus medius (GlutM) muscles were recorded. In addition, ankle kinematics were recorded using an inertial measurement unit. Results: Hip abductor fatigue induced a significant decrease in SEBT scores in three directions (p < 0.01). During SEBT, ankle supination decreased by 3.2ø in the anterior and posteromedial directions (p < 0.01). Muscle activity of GastL increased during achievement of three directions (p < 0.05) in response to hip abductor fatigue. In posteromedial direction, PL (p < 0.001) and GlutM (p < 0.01) activity increased with fatigue. During WBIT, inversion angular velocity was not impacted by fatigue while, PB and GastL activity increased after fatiguing exercise (p < 0.005). Conclusion: A decrease in SEBT performance and EMG adaptations with proximal fatigue attest to the importance of the hip abductor muscle in dynamic postural control. This could have important implications in building injury prevention programs. Changes in ankle supination may reflect a protective strategy of the joint in response to hip fatigue. ? 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1053,SC-436,Rabello et al. (2022),2022,Effects of task and hip-abductor fatigue on lower limb alignment and muscle activation,"Purpose: Fatigue-induced hip-abductor weakness may exacerbate lower-limb misalignments during different dynamic single-leg tasks. We sought to evaluate the effects of fatigue and task on lower limb kinematics and muscle activation and to find associations between measurements obtained in two tasks. Methods: One-group pretest?posttest design. Seventeen healthy adults (9ÿW) performed the single-leg squat (SL<inf>SQUAT</inf>) and the single-leg hop (SL<inf>HOP</inf>) before and after a hip-abduction fatigue protocol. Hip adduction, knee frontal plane projection angle (knee FPPA) and heel inversion displacement were measured during the eccentric phase of the SL<inf>SQUAT</inf> and the SL<inf>HOP</inf>, as well as activation of the gluteus medius (GMed), tensor fascia latae (TFL), peroneus longus (PER) and tibialis anterior (TA). Moments and tasks were compared using a repeated-measures two-way ANOVA. Correlation between tasks was evaluated using Spearman?s correlation. Results: No differences in kinematics or activation were found between moments. Hip-adduction displacement (P = 0.005), GMed (P = 0.008) and PER (P = 0.037) activation were higher during SL<inf>SQUAT</inf>, while TA activation was higher during SL<inf>HOP</inf> (P < 0.001). No differences were found between tasks in knee FPPA and heel inversion. Hip-adduction and knee FPPA were not correlated between tasks, while ankle inversion displacement was positively correlated (r<inf>s</inf> = 0.524?0.746). Conclusion: Different characteristics of SL<inf>SQUAT</inf> (slower and deeper) seem to have led to increased hip adduction displacement, GMed, and PER activation and decreased TA activation, likely due to higher balance requirements. However, hip-abductor fatigue didn?t influence lower-limb alignment during the tasks. Finally, evaluations should be performed with different single-leg tasks since they don?t give the same lower-limb alignment information. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1007/s11332-021-00854-4,Sport Sciences for Health
1054,SC-437,Chalidis et al. (2022),2022,Graft choices for anterolateral ligament knee reconstruction surgery: Current concepts,"The anterolateral ligament (ALL) is a primary structure of the anterolateral complex of the knee that contributes to internal rotational stability of the joint. Injury of the ALL is commonly associated with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. If left untreated, ALL lesions may lead to residual anterolateral rotational instability of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which is a common cause of anterior cruciate ligament graft failure. The function of the ALL can be restored by lateral extraarticular tenodesis or anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR). In the lateral extraarticular tenodesis procedure, a strip of the iliotibial band is placed in a non-anatomical position to restrain the internal rotation of the tibia, while in ALLR, a free graft is fixed at the insertion points of the native ALL. Gracilis and semitendinosus grafts have mainly been utilized for ALLR, but other autografts have also been suggested. Furthermore, allografts and synthetic grafts have been applied to minimize donor-site morbidity and maximize the size and strength of the graft. Nevertheless, there has been no strong evidence to fully support one method over another thus far. The present review presents a detailed description of the graft choices for ALLR and the current literature available in regard to the effectiveness and outcomes of published surgical techniques. ?

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. Results: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24?31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P<0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. Conclusion: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be an appropriate autograft for ACLR due to its strength, larger graft diameter, and avoiding potential complications of hamstring autograft obtained from the knee region. ? 2022 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of LWIs on the position of the midfoot and rearfoot joints by measuring the changes using a tracking device. Methods: The study was carried out with a total of 69 subjects. Movement measurements for the midfoot were made on the navicular bone, and for the rearfoot on the calcaneus bone. The Polhemus system was used, with two motion sensors fixed to each bone. Subjects were compared by having them use LWIs versus being barefoot. Results: There were statistically significant differences in the varus movement when wearing a 4 mm LWI (1.23 ñ 2.08ø, p < 0.001) versus the barefoot condition (0.35 ñ 0.95ø), and in the plantarflexion movement when wearing a 4 mm LWI (3.02 ñ 4.58ø, p < 0.001) versus the barefoot condition (0.68 ñ 1.34ø), in the midfoot. There were also statistically significant differences in the valgus movement when wearing a 7 mm LWI (1.74 ñ 2.61ø, p < 0.001) versus the barefoot condition (0.40 ñ 0.90ø), and in the plantar flexion movement when wearing a 4 mm LWI (2.88 ñ 4.31ø, p < 0.001) versus the barefoot condition (0.35 ñ 0.90ø), in the rearfoot.

The purpose of this study was to quantitate microstructural differences between corticospinal tracts in patients with chronic ankle instability and healthy controls. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Seventeen patients with chronic ankle instability and sixteen healthy controls underwent diffusion weighted-imaging scans using an ultra-high-field 7.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. We focused on corticospinal tracts as a region of interest and performed classical diffusion tensor imaging and the advanced neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging outcomes that measured the microstructure of white matter tracts. Correlation analyses were also performed between the significantly different diffusion outcomes in both groups. Results: The patients with chronic ankle instability showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (p-corrected = 0.045) and higher orientation dispersion index (p-corrected = 0.033) when compared with healthy controls. These two measures were significantly correlated in the healthy controls (r = ?0.56, p = 0.024) and the CAI patient group (r = ?0.53, p = 0.029). Conclusions: This study revealed that the contralateral corticospinal tract of the unstable ankle in patients with chronic ankle instability exhibited impaired integrity, which was associated with abnormally organized neurites. We propose that this is a useful target for the clinical assessment of chronic ankle instability and the development of targeted neuromuscular rehabilitation. ? 2022 Sports Medicine Australia",Scopus,10.1016/j.jsams.2022.05.003,Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport

It was hypothesized that muscle activation during the dual task would differ significantly from the walking task with respect to both timing (H1) and frequency (H2). The mean overall intensity for the COG trials was 4.1% lower for the tibialis anterior and 5.5% higher for the gastrocnemius medialis than in the WALK trials. The changes between the WALK and COG trials were short 50 ms bursts that occurred within 100 ms of heel strike in the tibialis anterior, and longer activation periods during the stance phase in the gastrocnemius medialis. No changes in overall intensity were observed in the peroneus longus, gastrocnemius lateralis, or soleus. Furthermore, no clear frequency bands within the signal could further characterize the overall changes in muscle activity during the COG task.

TC heterozygotes for TLR2 rs3804099 were associated with PTL after correcting for anemia, vaginal bleeding, and history of threatened miscarriage or PTL. TC and CC genotypes in TLR9 rs187084 were significantly less common in women with PTL, compared to the controls, after adjusting for bleeding and gestational diabetes. For the first time, it was shown that three polymorphisms?ANGPT2 rs3020221, TLR2 rs3804099 and TLR9 rs187084 ?were significantly associated with PTL, adjusted by pregnancy development influencing factors. ? 2022 by the authors.

1062,SC-445,Kim et al. (2022),2022,Spinal Reflex Excitability of Lower Leg Muscles Following Acute Lateral Ankle Sprain: Bilateral Inhibition of Soleus Spinal Reflex Excitability,"Neural changes in the ankle stabilizing muscles following ankle sprains are thought to be one contributing factor to persistent ankle dysfunction. However, empirical evidence is limited. Therefore, we aimed to examine spinal reflex excitability of lower leg muscles following acute ankle sprains (AAS). We performed a case-control study with 2 groups consisting of 30 young adults with AAS and 30 aged-matched uninjured controls. Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) testing was performed to estimate spinal reflex excitability of lower leg muscles: soleus, fibularis longus (FL), tibialis anterior (TA). Maximal H-reflex (H<inf>max</inf>) and motor responses (M<inf>max</inf>) were determined by delivering a series of electrical stimuli at the sciatic nerve. H<inf>max</inf>/M<inf>max</inf> ratios were calculated to represent normalized spinal reflex excitability. Separate group-by-limb analyses of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures found there were no significant interactions for any of the muscles (SL: F<inf>1,56</inf> = 0.95, p = 0.33, FL: F<inf>1,51</inf> = 0.65, p = 0.42, TA: F<inf>1,51</inf> = 1.87, p = 0.18), but there was a significant main effect of group in the soleus (F<inf>1,56</inf> = 6.56, p = 0.013), indicating the H<inf>max</inf>/M<inf>max</inf> ratio of soleus in the AAS group was significantly lower bilaterally (AAS = 0.56 ñ 0.19, control = 0.68 ñ 0.17, p = 0.013), with no significant group differences in the other muscles (FL: F<inf>1,51</inf> = 0.26, p = 0.61, TA: F<inf>1,51</inf> = 0.93, p = 0.34). The bilateral inhibition of the soleus spinal reflex excitability following AAS may be significant in that it may explain bilateral sensorimotor deficits (postural control deficits) following unilateral injury, and provide insights into additional therapies aimed at the neural change. ? 2022 by the authors.

1063,SC-446,Khan et al. (2022),2022,Does an Adjustable-Loop Device Loosen following ACL Reconstruction with a Hamstring Graft? A Retrospective Study with a Follow-Up of Two Years,"Arthroscopic anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is the gold stan-dard treatment for an ACL tear and requires the use of fixed or adjustable-loop devices to fix a femoral-side graft. Although the adjustable mechanism is designed to provide one-way tensioning, there is a concern that the adjustable loop will loosen and lengthen during cyclic loads, creating graft laxity. The present paper is a retrospective study of patients who underwent ACLR with the fixation of a hamstring graft with an adjustable loop on the femoral side from November 2016 to October 2018. The knee?s functional outcome was evaluated using an International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, Lachman test, and pivot shift test. The patients were assessed preoperatively and finally postoperatively after two years of surgery. Thirty-two patients were analyzed. Significant improvement was obtained in the final clinical outcome of the patients. Twenty-seven patients (84.4%) were Lachman negative, and twenty-eight patients (87.5%) were pivot shift test negative, the mean Lysholm score was 96.91, and the IKDC score was 91.47 (p < 0.001). There was no infection, graft failure, or flexion restriction. Arthroscopic ACLR with an adjustable-loop suspensory device is a successful fixation method for femoral-side graft fixation and offers a similar functional outcome as with fixed-loop devices. ? 2022 by the authors.

[Methods] A total of 14 patients had sMCL and POL reconstructed simultaneously with a half peroneal longus tendon autograft. The anterior half of the peroneal longus tendon was harvested to prepare the graft. After establishing the femoral and tibial bone tunnels respectively, the graft was folded, pulled into the femoral tunnel and fixed with a loop plate. The shorter and longer free ends were pulled into the tibial tunnels of sMCL and POL respectively, and tightened. The two end sutures were tied and enhanced by external row screws. [Results] All the 14 patients were followed up for 6~26 months, with an average of (12.57ñ6.04) months, except 1 patient. At the latest follow-up, the Lysholm, IKDC and VAS scores were significantly improved compared with those preoperatively (P<0.05). Radiographically, the inner joint space at 0øand 30ø flexion under valgus stress significantly decreased postoperatively compared with those preoperatively (P<0.05). [Conclusion] Simultaneous sMCL and POL reconstructions with a half peroneal tendon autograft does restore the stability of knee joint and considerably improve the function of the knee joint for old MCL injuries, with advantages of small incision, quick postoperative recovery and high patient satisfaction. ? 2022 Orthopedic Journal of China.

Methods: Twenty male and twenty female adults were required to execute single-leg side-jump landing before and after hip abductor fatigue protocol. The center of pressure (COP), ground reaction force (GRF), lower extremity kinematics, joint moment, muscle activity were compared. Results: For both males and females after fatigue, the maximum displacements and average velocities of COP decreased, and the peak angles of hip abduction and ankle eversion increased, and the peak torques of ankle inversion increased. At 200 ms pre-landing, the activiation of rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus were lower in male than that in female. At 200 ms post-landing, the activiation of biceps femoris in male was lower than that in female after fatigue. Conclusions: The postural stability in frontal plane decreased after hip abductor fatigue. The frontal plane control of hip joint and ankle joint was weakened, which might increase the risk of joint injury. There are differences in postural strategies for different genders, indicating that gender difference in the mechanism of lower limb joint injury is worth of further investigation. ? ? 2022 by the Editorial Board of Journal of Medical Biomechanics.",Scopus,10.16156/j.1004-7220.2022.03.023,Yiyong Shengwu Lixue/Journal of Medical Biomechanics
1067,SC-450,Grsoy et al. (2022),2022,Effect of Sectioning of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Posterolateral Structures on Lateral Compartment Gapping: A Randomized Biomechanical Study,"Background: The contribution of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to lateral instability under varus stress, particularly compared with posterolateral structures, is not well known. Purpose: To investigate the effect of sectioning the ACL and posterolateral knee structures on lateral compartment gapping under varus stress. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fourteen nonpaired cadaveric knees were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: sequential sectioning of the ACL, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) (ACL-first group) or sequential sectioning of the FCL, PLT, PFL, and ACL (FCL-first group). Knees were loaded onto a custom jig at a 20ø flexion angle. A standardized 12-Núm varus moment was applied to each specimen in the intact state and after each randomized sequential-sectioning state. Lateral compartment opening was measured on radiographs to assess the contribution to the increase in the lateral gap caused by resecting the respective structure. The distance was measured by 3 observers on 15 images (5 testing states each imaged 3 times) per specimen, for a total of 210 radiographs. The articular cartilage surfaces were not included in the measurements. Results: The mean increase in lateral opening after sectioning all structures (ACL and posterolateral corner) was 4.6 ñ 1.8 mm (range, 1.9-7.7 mm). The ACL and FCL sectioning contributed the most to lateral knee opening (1.3 ñ 0.6 and 2.2 ñ 1.3 mm, respectively). In both groups, lateral gapping >3 mm was achieved only after both the ACL and FCL were sectioned. All comparisons of increased mean gapping distances demonstrated a significant difference with subsequent sequential sectioning of structures, except comparisons between the FCL and PLT and the PLT and PFL. When considering the effect of the ACL on lateral opening, no significant difference was found between sectioning the ACL first or FCL first (P =.387). Conclusion: ACL deficiency significantly increased lateral opening under varus stress, regardless of the sequence of injury. The effect of injury to the ACL in addition to the lateral structures should be considered when using varus stress radiographs to evaluate knee injuries. Clinical Relevance: With the current findings, understanding the effect of ACL and posterolateral corner injuries on lateral gapping under varus stress can aid in correctly diagnosing knee injuries and determining appropriate treatment plans. ?

1068,SC-451,Ye et al. (2022),2022,Effect of Anterolateral Structure Augmentation on Graft Maturity After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Clinical and MRI Follow-up of 2 Years,"Background: Anterolateral structure augmentation (ALSA) has been applied to prevent residual rotatory instability and lower clinical failure rates after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR); however, the effect of combined ALSA on the maturity of ACL grafts remains unknown. Purpose: To evaluate the graft maturity and patient?reported outcomes in patients who underwent double?bundle ACLR with or without ALSA. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 92 patients who underwent double?bundle ACLR between January 2016 and July 2019 were included in the present study?44 patients with isolated ACLR (ACLR group) and 48 patients with combined ACLR and ALSA (ALSA group). Demographic characteristics, intraoperative findings, and patient?reported outcomes were prospectively collected. On postoperative magnetic resonance imaging at the 2?year follow?up, the signal?to?noise quotient (SNQ) values were separately calculated for 6 sections of the ACL graft, including the femoral intratunnel graft (FTG), intra?articular graft (IAG), and tibial intratunnel graft (TTG) of the anteromedial bundle (AMB) and the posterolateral bundle (PLB). Superior graft maturity was usually indicated by lower SNQ values. Results: The rates of return to preinjury sports were 47.9% and 27.3% in the ALSA and ACLR groups, respectively (difference, 20.6% [95% CI, 1.3%-40%]; P =.042). The AMB demonstrated significantly lower SNQ values in the ALSA group than in the ACLR group (FTG, 7.04 ñ 3.65 vs 9.44 ñ 4.51 [P =.006]; IAG, 6.62 ñ 4.19 vs 8.77 ñ 5.92 [P =.046]; TTG, 6.93 ñ 3.82 vs 8.75 ñ 4.55 [P =.040]). The SNQ values were significantly lower in the ALSA group for 2 of the 3 sections of the PLB (IAG, 7.73 ñ 4.61 vs 9.88 ñ 5.61 [P =.047]; TTG, 5.88 ñ 3.10 vs 8.57 ñ 4.32 [P =.001]). Partial lateral meniscectomy was correlated with higher SNQ values of the TTG in the AMB (? = 0.27; P =.009) and the PLB (? = 0.25; P =.008), with both groups pooled. Higher body mass index, smaller ACL graft?Blumensaat line angles, larger AMB graft diameters, and lower postoperative Tegner scores were also associated with inferior maturity in specific regions of the ACL graft. Conclusion: A combination of ACLR and ALSA is a desirable option to improve the maturity of ACL grafts for patients who are young or expected to return to pivoting sports. Meanwhile, further investigations with higher levels of evidence and longer periods of follow?up are warranted. ? 2022 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465221092768,American Journal of Sports Medicine

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to compare the results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with AHPLT and hamstring graft at the minimum of 3 years follow-up. Knee stability, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and Tegner activity level were collected. Results: There was no clinical significance regarding physical examination. Postoperative IKDC score was higher in the hamstring group compared with AHPLT group. Multiple regression analysis was done. The parsimonious model revealed graft types and gender were the most optimal variables explained postoperative IKDC score. Conclusion: AHPLT graft can be an alternative choice to conventional graft for single anatomic ACL reconstruction with less donor site morbidity, however there must be concern for smaller graft in short and thin female patients. ?

1070,SC-453,Chandru et al. (2022),2022,Is Peroneus longus autograft a better alternative to the Hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction? ? A randomised control study,"Purpose: The anterior cruciate ligament in the knee is commonly prone to injuries. Reconstruction of this ligament with hamstring tendon has been time-tested but peroneus longus autograft is also gaining popularity. However, very limited literature is available comparing the two grafts. This study aims to compare the functional outcome and donor site morbidity between hamstrings and peroneus longus autograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: A prospective randomised study was conducted on 45 patients, who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were assigned into Hamstring group and the Peroneus longus group. Functional outcome was assessed using Lysholm score and Modified Cincinnati scores for the knee joint and American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Scoring for ankle joint. Donor site morbidity was assessed by measuring flexion and extension strength of the knee and plantar flexion and eversion strength of the ankle by handheld dynamometer preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and 1 year follow up. Results: Functional outcome of the knee showed significant improvement in peroneus longus group (p-value 0.002) compared to hamstring group. Even though there was minimal reduction in functional outcome of the ankle at 6 months follow-up in peroneus longus group, it improved at one year follow-up. While assessing the donor site morbidity at the knee joint, knee flexion strength showed improvement in the group (p-value 0.02) but reduced in the hamstring group where the hamstring tendon was harvested. Knee extension strength in the hamstring group scored marginally better than the peroneus longus group, which was not statistically significant (p-value 0.5). Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint. ?

1071,SC-454,Piatkowska et al. (2022),2022,EMG analysis across different tasks improves prevention screenings in diabetes: a cluster analysis approach,"The aim of this work was twofold: on one side to determine the most suitable parameters of surface electromyography (sEMG) to classify diabetic subjects with and without neuropathy and discriminate them from healthy controls and second to assess the role of the task acquired in the classification process. For this purpose 30 subjects were examined (10 controls, 10 diabetics with and 10 without neuropathy) whilst walking and stair ascending and descending. The electrical activity of six muscles was recorded bilaterally through a 16-channel sEMG system synchronised with a stereophotogrammetric system: Rectus Femoris, Gluteus Medius, Tibialis Anterior, Peroneus Longus, Gastrocnemius Lateralis and Extensor Digitorum. Spatiotemporal parameters of gait and stair climbing and the following sEMG parameters were extracted: signal envelope, activity duration, timing of activation and deactivation. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to the whole set of parameters with different distances and linkage methods. Results showed that only by applying the Ward agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Hamming distance) to the all set of parameters extracted from both tasks, 5 well-separated clusters were obtained: cluster 3 included only DS subjects, cluster 2 and 4 only controls and cluster 1 and 5 only DNS subjects. This method could be used for planning rehabilitation treatments.

(2022),2022,Anatomical study of paratenons and fascia lata connections in the posteromedial knee region,"Introduction: In the last decade, fascia research increased significantly in various aspects such as anatomical and biomechanical features related to epimuscular force transmission. Methods: The present anatomic study focuses on macroscopic observations of the potential gracilis and semitendinosus paratenons, as well as fascial surroundings connections in the posteromedial knee region on 17 lower-limbs dissections. Results: The gracilis and semitendinosus expansions and paratenons were observed in all specimen and further connections with the fascia lata and crural fascia were demonstrated. Contrary to the previously described expansions connected to the tendons, we observed that the expansions were the edges of the paratenon tunnel and that the paratenon structure surrounded the overall muscle. Both paratenons of gracilis and semitendinosus were connected to the crural fascia and, respectively, to the sartorius fascia (part of the fascia lata), to the semimembranosus and the fascia lata. Furthermore, numerous connections between the fascia lata and the neighboring structures in the posteromedial knee region are described. Discussion?conclusion: The present study describes for the first time gracilis and semitendinosus paratenons and other surrounding fascial connections. Such macroscopic observations may represent a new basis for further characterization of the myofascial pathway of epimuscular force transmission in the knee region. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s00276-022-02927-6,Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy
1073,SC-456,Assi et al. (2022),2022,The gracilis and semitendinosus muscles: a morphometric study on 18 specimens with clinical implications,"Introduction: The pes anserinus consists of the sartorius, semitendinosus, and gracilis muscles. They coalesce together with the leg fascia to form the anserine plate. The semitendinosus and gracilis both form the deep layer of this plate and are clinically relevant for ligament reconstruction. The aim of the study is to report a detailed morphometric evaluation of the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles and assess their clinical implications. Methods: Using a rigorous dissection process on 18 cadaveric hips, measurements of both the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles with bone parameters were conducted. We measured the following: (a) total femur, femoral shaft, and neck lengths, (b) total muscle lengths, and (c) intra-muscular and extra-muscular (free) tendon lengths. Correlation values between bone variables, muscle variables, and in-between muscle variables were computed. Results: The total muscle and the distal intra-muscular tendon length of the St and Gr are correlated with the total femur length. When compared to gracilis, the total muscle and distal intra-muscular tendon lengths of the ST are much better correlated with the total femur length. The free distal tendon length for both muscles did not show a significant correlation with any of the femoral bone lengths. Conclusion: The variability of tendon length of the ST/Gr poses a significant challenge to surgeons. This study reports a detailed morphometric evaluation of the ST/Gr hamstring muscle and tendons. It revealed a positive correlation between the femoral length and the ST/Gr graft lengths. This could help orthopedic surgeons in predicting the graft lengths pre-operatively and develop better planning for reconstructive surgeries. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s00276-022-02925-8,Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy

(2022),2022,Alterations in Cortical Activation among Soccer Athletes with Chronic Ankle Instability during Drop-Jump Landing: A Preliminary Study,"Background: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a common peripheral joint injury and there is still no consensus on the mechanisms. It is necessary to investigate electrocortical parameters to provide clinical insight into the functional alterations of brain activity after an ankle sprain, which would greatly affect the implementation of rehabilitation plans. The purpose of this study was to assess cortical activation characteristics during drop-jump landing among soccer athletes with CAI. Methods: A total of 24 participants performed the drop-jump landing task on a force platform while wearing a 64-channel EEG system. The differences of power spectral density (PSD) in theta and alpha (alpha-1 and alpha-2) bands were analyzed between two groups (CAI vs. CON) and between two limbs (injured vs. healthy). Results: CAI participants demonstrated significantly higher theta power at the frontal electrode than that in healthy control individuals (F<inf>(1,22)</inf> = 7.726, p = 0.011, ?2 p = 0.260). No difference in parietal alpha-1 and alpha-2 power was found between groups (alpha-1: F<inf>(1,22)</inf> = 0.297, p = 0.591, ?2 p = 0.013; alpha-2: F<inf>(1,22)</inf> = 0.118, p = 0.734, ?2 p = 0.005). No limb differences were presented for any frequency band in selected cortical areas (alpha-1: F<inf>(1,22)</inf> = 0.149, p = 0.703, ?2 p = 0.007; alpha-2: F<inf>(1,22)</inf> = 0.166, p = 0.688, ?2 p = 0.007; theta: F<inf>(1,22)</inf> = 2.256, p = 0.147, ?2 p = 0.093).

(2022),2022,"Effects of the Ankle Flexion Angle During Anterior Talofibular Ligament Reconstruction on Ankle Kinematics, Laxity, and In Situ Forces of the Reconstructed Graft","Background: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the ankle flexion angle during anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) reconstruction on ankle kinematics, laxity, and in situ force of a graft. Methods: Twelve cadaveric ankles were evaluated using a 6?degrees of freedom robotic system to apply passive plantar flexion and dorsiflexion motions and multidirectional loads. A repeated measures experiment was designed using the intact ATFL, transected ATFL, and reconstructed ATFL. During ATFL reconstruction (ATFLR), the graft was fixed at a neutral position (ATFLR 0 degrees), 15 degrees of plantar flexion (ATFLR PF15 degrees), and 30 degrees of plantar flexion (ATFLR PF30 degrees) with a constant initial tension of 10 N. The 3-dimensional path and reconstructed graft tension were simultaneously recorded, and the in situ force of the ATFL and reconstructed grafts were calculated using the principle of superposition. Results: The in situ forces of the reconstructed grafts in ATFLR 0 degrees and ATFLR PF 15 degrees were significantly higher than those of intact ankles. The ankle kinematics and laxity produced by ATFLR PF 30 degrees were not significantly different from those of intact ankles. The in situ force on the ATFL was 19.0 N at 30 degrees of plantar flexion. In situ forces of 41.0, 33.7, and 21.9 N were observed at 30 degrees of plantar flexion in ATFLR 0, 15, and 30 degrees, respectively. Conclusion: ATFL reconstruction with the peroneus longus (PL) tendon was performed with the graft at 30 degrees of plantar flexion resulted in ankle kinematics, laxity, and in situ forces similar to those of intact ankles. ATFL reconstructions performed with the graft fixed at 0 and 15 degrees of the plantar flexion resulted in higher in situ forces on the reconstructed graft. Clinical Relevance: Fixing the ATFL tendon graft at 30 degrees of plantar flexion results in an in situ force closest to that of an intact ankle and avoids the excessive tension on the reconstructed graft. ?

(2022),2022,Six-Week Remodeled Bike Pedal Training Improves Dynamic Control of Lateral Shuffling in Athletes With Functional Ankle Instability,"Background: Remodeled bicycle pedal training with multidirectional challenges through muscle strengthening and neuromuscular facilitation may increase dynamic postural control and performance during lateral shuffling for athletes with functional ankle instability (FAI). Hypothesis: The 6-week remodeled bicycle pedal training is effective on the ankle joint control and muscle activation, and especially that of the ankle evertor muscle co-contraction to improve dynamic postural control during lateral shuffling for athletes with FAI. Study Design: Laboratory randomized controlled trial. Level of Evidence: Level 2. Methods: Fourteen healthy athletes (healthy group) and 26 athletes with FAI aged 18 to 30 years were included in the study. The athletes with FAI were randomly assigned to either the training group (FAI-T group) or the nontraining group (FAI-NT group). The athletes in the FAI-T group underwent 6 weeks of remodeled bicycle pedal training, whereas those in the FAI-NT group did not undergo any intervention. Muscle co-contraction index and muscle activation in the initial contact (IC) and propulsion phases, and ankle joint angle in the IC and propulsion phases were measured during lateral shuffling before and after 6 weeks of training. Results: After remodeled bicycle pedal training, the FAI-T group demonstrated greater muscle activation in the hamstring (P = 0.01), greater muscle coactivation of the tibialis anterior (TA) and the peroneus longus (P = 0.01), and greater ankle eversion angle in the IC phase. Significantly greater muscle activation of the TA (P = 0.01), greater coactivation of quadriceps and hamstring (P = 0.03), and a smaller ankle inversion angle (P = 0.04) in the propulsion phase were observed in the FAI-T group after training compared with those in the FAI-NT group. Conclusion: Remodeled bicycle pedal training facilitates the TA and peroneus longus activation and the coactivation of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles during lateral shuffling and resulted in enhanced ankle and knee joint stability. In addition, a better ankle movement strategy during a dynamic task can be achieved via a 6-week remodeled pedal training program. Clinical Relevance: This remodeled bicycle pedal training can be effective for rehabilitating athletes with FAI to recover lateral dynamic movement capability. ? 2021 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/19417381211035781,Sports Health

The objective for this pilot study was to investigate whether the ST graft could function as a meniscal transplant. Methods: The ST was doubled and sutured with running sutures and pull-out sutures in each end. Bone tunnels were used for root anchorage and the graft was sutured with allinside, inside-out and outside-in technique. The pull-out sutures were fixed over a button. Partial weight bearing was allowed with limited range of motion in a brace for the first 6ÿweeks. Evaluation was assessed using clinical examination, radiology and patient reported outcome. Results: A total of seven patients have been included between January 2018 and June 2020. Six medial transplants and one lateral transplant were performed. Mean age was 29ÿyears. Four patients had completed the 12-month follow-up. Improvements were noted for IKDC Global Score, KOOS pain subscale and Lysholm. MRI indicated that the transplant become more wedge-like with visible roots and minor protrusion. Conclusions: Even though this is primarily a technical report the follow-up data indicate that the transplant survives and adapts in shape and capabilities to an original meniscus. There were no adverse events and the patients seem to improve in terms of pain and quality of life. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-021-06606-8,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"
1078,SC-461,Perry et al. (2022),2022,"Determining the Roles of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Posterolateral Corner, and Medial Collateral Ligament in Knee Hyperextension Using the Heel-Height Test","Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are often associated with other ligamentous injuries. The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. Purpose: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-Núm force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P =.863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 ñ 0.83?cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL?posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 ñ 1.02?cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 ñ 1.35?cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P =.154). Conclusion: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height. Clinical Relevance: The side-to-side difference in heel height may be a clinically relevant examination tool for diagnosing multiligament knee injuries. ?

(2022),2022,Classification of the popliteofibular ligament,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the morphological variations in the distal attachment of the popliteofibular ligament (PFL) and create an accurate classification for use in planning surgical procedures in this area and in evaluating radiological imaging. One hundred and thirty-seven lower limbs of body donors fixed in 10% formalin solution were examined for the presence and course of the PFL. The PFL was present in 88.3% of cases. We propose the following three-fold classification: type I (72.3%), the most common type, characterized by the attachment onto the apex of the head of the fibula, type II (8.7%), characterized by a bifurcation, with the dominant band inserting on the anterior slope of the styloid process of the fibula and the smaller band onto the posterior surface of the styloid process of the fibula and type III (7.3%), characterized by a double PFL: the first PFL (main) originated from the popliteus tendon and inserted onto the anterior slope of the styloid process of theÿfibula, while the second originated from the musculotendinous junction of the popliteus muscle and inserted on the posterior surface of the styloid process of the fibula. The PFL was characterized by high morphological variation, as reflected in our proposed classification. This variation may present clinical and biomechanical issues for both medical personnel and researchers. Our proposed classification may be valuable for clinicians who evaluate and perform surgical procedures within the knee joint area. ? 2022 American Association for Clinical Anatomists and the British Association for Clinical Anatomists.",Scopus,10.1002/ca.23842,Clinical Anatomy
1080,SC-463,Debbarma et al. (2022),2022,A taxonomy of green governance: A qualitative and quantitative analysis towards sustainable development,"It is undeniable that our environment is constantly evolving and citizens are facing new issues and challenges related to the environment around the world. Green governance is essential to achieve the goals agreed upon by local and global governments. The concept of green governance makes it possible to understand the integration of the actors of each governance form during decision-making. In this article, we identify the research gap and propose a taxonomy of green governance for sustainable development. We used factor analysis to construct the taxonomy of green governance. We also proposed the critical influencing factors of green governance to build sustainable development. To evaluate the importance of green governance for reducing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and other energy-related consumption, this study conducted two case studies with empirical analysis on the OECD Indian dataset of green growth indicators. The Indian green growth indicators are predicted using a machine learning technique that employs linear digression, support vector machine (SVM), and Gaussian process. The analysis shows that the taxonomy of green governance?global governance, adaptive governance, climate governance, ecological governance, self-governance, energy governance, and information technology (IT) governance?are related to each other and can work on the same objective by pursuing different activities. In addition, the case study analysis shows that the SVM is the superior technique in terms of predicting the time series data in this study. Based on the analysis, this study suggest that green governance is vital for achieving global sustainable goals for future growth, and policy-makers should keep this in mind when making environmental policy decisions. ? 2022",Scopus,10.1016/j.scs.2022.103693,Sustainable Cities and Society

Methods: Twenty patients with an ACL-ruptured knee and a healthy contralateral side were included. Nine patients received an isolated DB-ACLR (DB-ACLR group), and 11 patients had a DB-ACLR with ALSA (DB+ALSA group). At 1-year follow-up, a combined computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and dual fluoroscopy imaging system analysis was used to capture a single-legged lunge of both the operated and healthy contralateral side. Tibiofemoral contact points (CPs) of the medial and lateral compartments were compared. CP locations were expressed as anteroposterior (AP, +/?) and medial?lateral (ML, ?/+) values according to the tibia. Results: In the DB-ACLR knees, no significant differences were found in CPs when compared with the healthy contralateral knees (P ò .31). However, in the DB+ALSA knees, the CPs in the lateral compartment had a significantly more anterior (mean AP: operative, ?2.8 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] ?5.0 to?0.7 vs healthy, ?5.0 mm, 95% CI ?6.7 to ?3.2; P = .006) and lateral (mean ML: operative, 23.2 mm, 95% CI 21.9-24.5 vs healthy, 21.8 mm, 95% CI 20.2-23.3; P = .013) location. The CPs in the medial compartment were located significantly more posterior (mean AP: operative, ?3.4, 95% CI ?5.0 to ?1.9 vs healthy, ?1.3, 95% CI ?2.6 to ?0.1; P = .006) and lateral (mean ML: operative, ?21.3, 95% CI ?22.6 to ?20.0 vs healthy, ?22.6, 95% CI ?24.2 to ?21.0; P = .021). Conclusions: DB-ACLR restored the tibiofemoral cartilage contact mechanics to near-normal values at 1-year follow-up. Adding the ALSA to the DB-ACLR resulted in significantly altered tibiofemoral cartilage contact locations in both the medial and lateral compartments. Clinical Relevance: In DB-ACLR knees, the addition of an ALSA may be unfavorable as it caused significantly changed arthrokinematics. ? 2021 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.arthro.2021.08.037,Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery
1082,SC-465,Mansur et al. (2022),2022,Intra- and inter-rater reliability for the measurement of the cross-sectional area of ankle tendons assessed by magnetic resonance imaging,"Background: The cross-sectional area (CSA) records make an essential measurement for determining the mechanical properties of tendons, such as stress and strength. However, there is no consensus regarding the best method to record the CSA from different tendons. Purpose: To determine intra- and inter-rater reliability for CSA measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the following tendons: tibialis anterior; tibialis posterior; fibularis longus and brevis; and Achilles. Material and Methods: We designed an observational study with repeated measures taken from a convenience sample of 20 participants diagnosed with acute or chronic ankle sprain. Two independent raters took three separate records from the CSA of ankle tendon images of each MRI slice. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% limits of agreement (LoA) defined the quality (associations) and magnitude (differences), respectively, of intra- and inter-rater reliability on the measures plotted by the Bland?Altman method. Results: Data showed very high intra- and inter-rater correlations for measures taken from all tendons analyzed (ICC 0.952?0.999). It also revealed an excellent agreement between raters (0.12%?2.3%), with bias no higher than 2 mm2 and LoA in the range of 4.4?7.9 mm2. The differences between repeated measures recorded from the thinnest tendons (fibularis longus and brevis) revealed the lowest bias and narrowest 95% LoA. Conclusion: Reliability for the CSA of ankle tendons measured from MRI taken by independent rates was very high, with the smallest differences between raters observed when the thinnest tendon was analyzed. ?

1083,SC-466,Saki et al. (2022),2022,Female athletes with ligament dominance exhibiting altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns compared to healthy individuals during single-leg landing,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most serious knee injuries and occurs frequently during exercise. Altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns may contribute to dynamic knee valgus and ACL injury mechanisms. Lack of dynamic control of ground reaction force (GRF) is known to be contributing factor for ACL injury by placing excessive force on passive structures. Muscle co-contraction is a dynamic mechanism for GRF absorption. Therefore, any alterations in co-contraction might be a risk factor for ACL injury. Ligament dominance is a term to define individuals who rely more on ACL ligament for GRF control. Research question: This study aimed to compare the muscle co-contraction patterns of distal and proximal knee muscles during single leg landing in female athletes with and without ligament dominance. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 54 female athletes were assigned to the healthy (n = 27) and ligament dominance (n = 27) group based on their Tuck Jump test scores. The electromyography activity of the gluteus medius, adductor longus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured by an electromyography in drop down a 30-cm-high stair. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis (p ó 0.05). Results: The two groups demonstrated an overall significantly different muscle co-contraction patterns (P < 0.05). There was a decreased in co-contraction of proximal group and an increased co-contraction in the distal muscles in ligament dominant group. Significance: The findings have provided evidence to support the notion of neuromuscular imbalances in ligament dominance deficit. These findings can be useful for the coaches and experts to design preventive exercises and modify the current programs for the people affected by ligament dominance. ? 2022",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2022.02.011,Gait and Posture

(2022),2022,"Implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the clinical, hematological, and inflammatory parameters in COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cross-sectional study","Background: The current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is characterized by atypical pneumonia, mild colds, and more severe illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory distress, thrombosis, organ failure, and various secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Notably, the severity of COVID-19 in different age groups is not well known, and the validity of clinical laboratory data remains unclear. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we examined differential regulation of clinical, hematologic, and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. We divided 104 COVID-19 patients into five different groups according to age (0?17, 18?45, 46?65, 66?79, and >80 years). Baseline data (sex, comorbidities, intensive care admission, and medications), hematologic markers, liver, and renal function tests, coagulation, and inflammatory markers were examined in these groups. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal threshold for predicting COVID-19 biological markers. Results: We found that the highest percentage (45%) of COVID-19 patients was in the age group of 46?65 years. The hematologic parameters (WBC, HB, and PLT) were normal between the patient groups. The area under the curve in ROC analysis showed significant differences in the levels of creatine, GGT, BUN, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, AST, and procalcitonin between the patients of age groups 46?65 and 66?79 years. Renal biomarkers were significantly high in most patients, regardless of age. In contrast, the liver biomarkers, did not differ significantly between patient groups. Conclusion: The main finding of our study is that laboratory parameters such as GGT, creatinine, BUN, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin and D-dimer were differentially regulated in COVID -19 patients of different age groups. Importantly, these laboratory parameters may help as clinical predictors to assess the severity of the disease in the population. We conclude here that age is an important factor influencing COVID-19 severity. ? 2022 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.jiph.2021.12.013,Journal of Infection and Public Health

(2022),2022,Proprioceptive postural control strategies differ among non-injured athletes,"Postural control during complex tasks requires adequate sensory integration and somaesthetic reweighting: suboptimal postural strategies can lead to injury. We assessed the ability of healthy athletes to reweight somaesthetic signals during postural perturbations on different surfaces. Thirty-five young (16 ñ 1 years), healthy, elite handball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Proprioceptive reweighting was evaluated via vibration of the triceps surae and lumbar muscles on firm and foam surfaces. Postural variables and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius (GM), semitendinosus (ST) and fibularis longus (FL) were recorded during the PRE (10 s), VIBRATION (20 s) and POST (20 s) periods. Ankle proprioception was predominantly used on the firm compared to foam support. However, two opposing behaviours were observed: a ?rigid? strategy in which reliance on ankle proprioception increased on the foam, and a ?plastic? strategy that involved a proximal shift of proprioceptive reliance (p < 0.001). The plastic strategy was associated with a more effective recovery of balance after vibration cessation (p < 0.05). ST activation was higher during POST in the rigid strategy and did not return to the PRE level (p < 0.05) whereas it did in the plastic strategy. Proprioceptive strategies for postural control are highly variable and future studies should evaluate their contribution to injury. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.neulet.2021.136366,Neuroscience Letters

(2022),2022,Reconstruction of chronic tibialis anterior tendon ruptures using a free anterior half of a peroneus longus tendon autograft: A technical note,"Purpose: Chronic rupture of the tibialis anterior (TA) tendon is rare. Several reconstruction techniques have been introduced. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of a free anterior half of a peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) autograft has not been reported for reconstruction of TA tendon rupture. This study aimed to describe the surgical technique and present the clinical outcomes of reconstruction of the chronic TA tendon ruptures using an AHPLT autograft. Methods: Between September 2013 and April 2019, five patients with chronic TA tendon rupture were surgically treated by reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. The AHPLT could be easily harvested percutaneously with a tendon stripper from the ipsilateral lower leg around the reconstruction site. The study included four men and one woman, with a mean age of 43.8 (range: 23?65) years. Results: At a mean follow-up period of 42.8 (range; 12?70) months, the mean Foot Function Index value significantly improved from 53.6 ñ 19.8 preoperatively to 25.8 ñ 20.8 postoperatively (p =.04). None of the patients had morbidities (such as nerve injury, delayed tendon ruptures, or tenosynovitis) around the AHPLT donor site. Three patients were very satisfied, two patients were satisfied, and one patient was fair with the results. Conclusions: Reconstruction of chronic TA tendon ruptures using a free AHPLT autograft could be successfully performed with satisfactory clinical outcomes and minimal donor site morbidities. Future studies with a larger population size and a comparative group are warranted to confirm these findings. ? The Author(s) 2022.",Scopus,10.1177/10225536221083044,Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery
1088,SC-471,Marcone et al. (2022),2022,Phytoplasma diseases of trees,"This chapter summarizes information on a selected number of phytoplasma diseases of temperate trees, with emphasis on molecular and taxonomic aspects of the associated phytoplasmas. The reviewed diseases are widespread and of considerable economic and ecological significance. They differ in their geographic distribution, number, and size of the various taxonomic groups and subgroups of the associated phytoplasma(s), and insect-vector relationships. Various diseases such as European stone fruit yellows, X-disease, apple proliferation, elm yellows, alder yellows, and ash yellows appear to be specific because they are induced by specific pathogens, which exhibit a high plant host and insect vector specificity. For each of these diseases, in addition to the specific pathogen, the occurrence of ?nonspecific? phytoplasmas has also been reported to be associated in some instances. However, the etiological role of these ?nonspecific? phytoplasmas needs to be validated by pathological studies. Other phytoplasma diseases of trees such as those affecting conifers and eucalyptus are each associated with taxonomically different phytoplasmas, which induce identical symptoms in a given plant host and are present in the same areas or different countries. Phytoplasma diseases of trees very often escape observation because affected plants show nonspecific symptoms only such as yellowing, stunting, and/or decline. Also, the phytoplasma titer in diseased plants is often so low that infections can only be detected through highly sensitive nested PCR assays. Latent phytoplasma infections, which are common in trees, can serve as inoculum reservoirs for further spread to susceptible plants. ? 2023 Elsevier Inc.

To date, the problem ofchoosing the optimal graftfor anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and the methods for its formation is one of the main trends in the surgical treatment of patients with anterior knee joint instability. The aim. To compare the results of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the known method and the new proposed method for autograft formation. Materials andmethods. Theresults oftreatmentofACLinjury in44 patientswere assessed. In the main group (19 patients), an original technique of ACL reconstruction from 1/2 of the width of m. peroneus longus tendon was used. In the control group (25 patients), ACL reconstruction was performed using a graft from the m. semitendinosus tendon prepared by the Lubowitz method. Results. The mean difference in the circumference of the distal third of the hip in the main group was 1.57 ñ 1.162 cm and was statistically significantly better than in the control group, where the mean difference in the hip circumference was 4.74 ñ 1.7207 cm. The range of motion of the knee joint in the main group 3 months after the surgery was 128.42 ñ 9.287ø, and in the control group mean flection was 109.6 ñ 9.120ø. The functional results in the main group were assessed by the Lisholm scale and were statistically significantly better than the results in the control group. The functional results by the AOFAS (American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society) scale in the main group were 100 points before the surgery and at all terms after the surgery: this indicates that the use of 1/2 of the width of m. peroneus longus tendon does not cause the its functional impairement. Conclusion. Anterior cruciate ligament plasty with use of 1/2 of the width of m. peroneus longus tendon prepared by the proposed method showed statistically significantly better results compared to the preparation of autograft from semitendinous muscle tendon using known method. ? 2022 Scientific Centre for Family Health and Human Reproduction Problems.

Methods: A total of 40 Chinese male runners from Ningbo University were recruited for this study (age: 22.3 ñ 3.01 years; height: 174.67 ñ 7.11 cm; body weight (BW): 66.83 ñ 9.91 kg). The participants were asked to perform a running task. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was used to investigate any differences between NS and BS during the running stance phases. The principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to further explore the differences of the muscle force between the BS and NS. Results: Significant differences ( p < 0.05) were found in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ1), ground reaction force (GRF), ankle joint and around muscle forces. Furthermore, the accuracy of SVM model in identifying the gait muscle force between BS and NS reached 100%, which proved that the BS had a very large impact on the gait muscle force compared with NS. Conclusions: We found that BS may be better suited to the human condition than other unstable shoes, or even NS. In addition, our results suggest that BS play an important role in reducing ankle injuries during running by increasing muscle participation in unstable conditions while better restoring the most primitive instability of foot condition that humans have. ? 2022, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

We propose to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation and compression to improve sample efficiency. To avoid training of the Transformer, we introduce FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained token embeddings. To form these associations, a modern Hopfield network stores these token embeddings, which are retrieved by queries that are obtained by a random but fixed projection of observations. Our new method, HELM, enables actor-critic network architectures that contain a pretrained language Transformer for history representation as a memory module. Since a representation of the past need not be learned, HELM is much more sample efficient than competitors. On Minigrid and Procgen environments HELM achieves new state-of-the-art results.

(2022),2022,First-Aid System for Marathon Athletes Based on Telemedicine Technology,"With the emphasis on sports in the region and the improvement of people's living standards, more and more people participate in various sports and activities including marathon, so that more and more cities are hosting or even vying for it. With the marathon, not only the joy of successfully holding the event, but also the pain of the contestants and even the sadness of sudden death. In order to reduce the occurrence of such problems, this paper studies the emergency system of marathon runners based on telemedicine technology. The experimental results show that the research on first-aid bears for athletes based on telemedicine technology can save a lot of time and managers, improve the efficiency of first aid by 3.45%, and provide first-aid services for injured athletes at the first time, so as to ensure the health of athletes, ensuring the confidence and well-being of athletes participating in the marathon. ? 2022 Caixia Chen and Shuai Liu.",Scopus,10.1155/2022/3335225,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics
1096,SC-479,Sakti et al. (2022),2022,A comparison of functional knee outcomes post-arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using hamstring and peroneus longus (PL) autograft,"Background: Hamstring autograft (HA) is the most common graft used in ACL reconstruction procedures. However, harvesting HA could weaken the secondary stabilizer of the knee joint. Peroneus longus grafts (PL) is a novel option secondary to hamstring graft with less morbidity at the knee joint. We intended to determine whether peroneus longus autograft (PL) is a comparable alternative to hamstring autograft for ACL Reconstruction. Methods: 84 patients were grouped into ?hamstring? (n = 51) and ?peroneus longus? (n = 33) groups, with a mean age of 26.2 ñ 5.9 in the Hamstring group and a mean age of 26.4 ñ 6.6 in peroneus group. We obtain secondary data from the medical records of several hospitals in Makassar. Results: There was a significant difference in Lysholm score (p<0.05) in the hamstring group with peroneus at 6 months and 12 months postoperatively for IKDC score, anterior translation, Power Grading Flexi-Extension, ROM on flexion, and extension. In addition, in muscle atrophy, the Hamstring group compared to the peroneus group also showed a significant difference (p=0.001). Conclusion: The study?s results did not show significant differences between the hamstring and peroneus groups other than atrophy of thigh muscles in the hamstring group. Based on the results of this study, we conclude peroneus longus graft is one of the graft options in ACL reconstruction surgery. ? 2022, Sanglah General Hospital.

1097,SC-480,Xu et al. (2022),2022,Retraction:Meta-Analysis of Knee Joint Function Recovery after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction by Accelerated Rehabilitation Surgery,"Objective. This investigation was undertaken to systematically assess the impact of increasingly rapid recovery treatment on the functional status of the knee following anterior cruciate ligament restructuring. Methods. Computer search from the establishment of the database to March 2022 in China Knowledge Network Database (CNKI), PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, CochraneLibrary, China VIP Database, Wanfang Database, and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). The control group was given only traditional rehabilitation training, and the observation group was treated with perioperative accelerated rehabilitation surgery intervention randomized controlled trial (RCT). Data for all included studies were extracted by two independent researchers, and the risk of bias for the quality of each included study was assessed by the Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 criteria. Meta-analysis of the collected data by using RevMan5.4 statistical software. Results. A total of 593 articles were retrieved from the computer database and 8 RCT articles with a total of 636 samples were finally included for meta-analysis. According to the Jadad scale, the RCT score of 8 articles was ò4 points. Meta-analysis was performed on the postoperative VAS scores of the ERAS group and the traditional rehabilitation group, and the heterogeneity test showed Chi2 = 288.60, df = 5, P<0.00001, and I2 = 99%. There was a statistically significant difference in the postoperative VAS scale between the intervention and the traditional rehabilitation model P<0.05. Eight articles reported the effect of accelerated rehabilitation surgery on the recovery of knee joint motion after ACL rehabilitation. After meta-analysis, the heterogeneity test showed Chi2 = 314.98, df = 7, P<0.00001, and I2 = 98%, and it can be concluded from the analysis that, compared with the traditional rehabilitation model, the enhanced rehabilitation surgery has an effect on the joint function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The improvement effect was more significant, and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. Four articles reported the effect of enhanced recovery after surgery intervention on the range of motion of the knee joint of patients, the heterogeneity test showed Chi2 = 117.52, df = 2, P<0.00001, and I2 = 98%, through analysis, and compared with the traditional rehabilitation model and the enhanced recovery. The effect of surgery on the range of motion of the knee joint after ACL reconstruction was more significant, and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. The effect of enhanced recovery after surgery and traditional rehabilitation mode on the incidence of postoperative adverse reactions in patients undergoing ACL reoperation was analyzed. The results of heterogeneity test showed that Chi2 = 1.59, df = 2, P=0.66>0.05, and I2 = 98%, and the analysis showed that, compared with the traditional rehabilitation mode, enhanced rehabilitation surgery can significantly reduce the risk of adverse reactions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction P<0.05. An inverted funnel plot was used to analyze publication bias in studies with quality of life as an outcome measure. The results showed that Egger's test P=0.0005<0.001 suggesting that there may be a certain degree of publication bias. Conclusion. The existing research evidence shows that accelerating the reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament can effectively promote the recovery of knee joint function, reduce the pain of patients, and reduce postoperative complications. However, more research is needed to further verify this. ? 2022 Junxiang Xu et al.",Scopus,10.1155/2022/5085143,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience
1098,SC-481,Shair et al. (2022),2022,Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendon auto grafts versus peroneus longus tendon auto grafts in isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury,"Objective: To compare the outcome and donor-site morbidity between peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendon in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methodology: A total of 80 cases aged 15 ? 40 years undergoing single-bundle ACL reconstruction fromJanuary 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled. All were randomly assigned to either hamstring tendon group or PLT group. Functional scoring as ?International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)?, ?Modified Cincinnati? and ?Lysholm scores? were noted prior to surgery and at the end of follow-up period of 9-months after surgery. Donor-site morbidity was also assessed. Results: Out of 80 cases, there were 66 (82.5%) were male. Mean age in hamstring group was 27.4 + 9.1 versus 25.8 + 8.6 years in PLT group (p = 0.4214). Thigh circumference between operated and sound leg was significantly high in hamstring group (p < 0.0001). None of the patient in PLT group had any other donor-site morbidity while 6 (16.7%) patients in hamstring group were found to have anterior kneeling pain. Conclusion: Peroneus longus as graft choice in isolated ACL injuries needs further encouragement, as it was found to have less donor-site related morbidities especially among individuals who commonly kneel during their daily activities. ? 2022, Pakistan Medical Association.

1099,SC-482,Werasirirat et al. (2022),2022,Effect of supervised rehabilitation combined with blood flow restriction training in athletes with chronic ankle instability: a randomized placebo-controlled trial,"Blood flow restriction (BFR) resistance exercise has been advocated as an alternative approach for improving muscle strength in patients undergoing musculoskeletal rehabilitation. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a 4-week supervised rehabilitation (R) with and without BFR on muscle strength, cross-sectional area (CSA), dynamic balance, and functional performance in athletes with chronic ankle instability (CAI). A total of 16 collegiate athletes with CAI participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to the BFR+R group (n=8) or the R group (n = 8). Both groups underwent supervised rehabilitation 3 times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Additionally, the BFR+R group was applied with a cuff around the proximal thigh at 80% arterial occlusion pressure in addition to the traditional rehabilitation program, whereas the R group received the sham BFR only. Before and after 4 weeks of intervention, isokinetic muscle strength, CSA, Y-balance test, and side hop test (SHT) were measured. Following a 4-week intervention, the BFR+R group exhibited significant improvements in muscle strength of ankle plantarflexor and evertor, CSA of fibularis longus, and SHT timed performance compared with prior training and the R group (all, P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed on dynamic balance among the groups. The present finding indicated that a 4-week supervised rehabilitation combined with BFR is more effective in improving muscle strength and size and functional performance compared with the traditional rehabilitation alone. This information could have implications for physical therapists and clinician in developing and designing a rehabilitation program for athletes with CAI. ? 2022.

1100,SC-483,Kinoshita et al. (2022),2022,Stepwise increase of upper limb muscle activity induced by progressive 4 positions of a handstand training,"BACKGROUND: Handstand is the most important fundamental skill in gymnastics. A gradual and well-balanced increase in muscle loading in a manner is preferred for young beginners and/or recovering gymnasts to safely achieve the muscle strength required to perform a stable handstand. OBJECTIVE: To examine upper limb muscle activity during different levels of handstand training positions. METHODS: This study utilized four different positions for progressive handstand training; namely, the 90, 135, elbow stand, and handstand positions. The activities of eight upper limb muscles (upper, middle, and lower trapezius; serratus anterior; anterior and middle deltoid; infraspinatus; and latissimus dorsi were measured by surface electromyography (EMG) for each position. The percentages of EMG in each muscle compared to the values during maximum voluntary contraction were calculated and compared between the positions. RESULTS: Muscle activity around the shoulder increased gradually throughout the progression of the four handstand training positions. Furthermore, the muscles required for scapular stabilization, such as the upper and middle trapezius and serratus anterior muscles, were activated at levels similar to those for a handstand without performing this movement. CONCLUSIONS: A progressive handstand training program of four different positions resulted in gradual and well-balanced increases in muscle activity. ? 2022 - IOS Press.

1101,SC-484,Lee et al. (2022),2022,Outcomes After Hip Labral Reconstruction Using Peroneus Longus Graft: A Novel Graft Experience,"Currently, there is no consensus on the ideal graft for hip labral reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to describe the surgical technique and report the short-term outcomes after hip labral reconstruction using a peroneal longus allograft. Eleven patients diagnosed with femoracetabular impingement and irreparable damage to the acetabular labrum underwent labral reconstruction with a peroneus longus allograft. The average follow-up time was 227 days (range: 26-457 days). Pre-operative radiographic measurements included an average pre-operative center edge angle of 29.0ø (range: 19ø to 37ø) and an average alpha angle of 62.9ø (range: 55ø to 71ø). All patients underwent femoroplasty, with additional procedures including 7 acetabuloplasties and 6 microfractures. The average visual analogue score for pain improved from 4.91ñ2.17 preoperatively to 3.85ñ2.0 postoperatively but this was not significant (P=.26). No patients sustained post-operative complications or allograft failures during follow up. Compared to other acetabular labral reconstruction options, the strength and shape of thedcd peroneus tendon may best replicate the native hip labrum. The current findings of no immediate post-operative complications or early failures suggests the peroneus longus allograft may be a viable option for hip labrum reconstruction. ? 2022 The Authors.",Scopus,0,Hawaii Journal of Health and Social Welfare

(2022),2022,Comparison of results of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction of the knee joint using peroneus longus tendon autograft or patellar tendon autograft with two bone blocks,"Introduction Growing knowledge and understanding of the biomechanics and kinematics of the knee are prompting the search for new surgical techniques and new ACL grafts. Purpose Evaluation of the medium-term results of primary arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee using peroneus longus tendon autograft and comparing the results with the control group of patients who underwent primary arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using patellar tendon autograft with two bone blocks. Materials and methods 108 patients were operated on in 2017-2018. They were divided into two groups. 55 patients underwent reconstruction of ACL using peroneus longus ligament autograft ? group 1 (study group). 53 patients underwent reconstruction of ACL using patella tendon autograft ? group 2 (control group). Evaluation of the knee joint function was based on clinical examination, medical history, results of functional tests, MRI results, on the data of instrumental diagnostic methods (CT?1000) after the surgical treatment, patient responses when filling out scales before surgery and two years after the surgery (Tegner Lysholm, IKDC). Additionally, the patients of the study group underwent a study on a plantograph before surgery and 24 months after it. Postoperative evaluation was also performed using the AOFAS scale. Results In group 1, the average score on the Tegner Lysholm scale before surgery was 69.2 ñ 10.7 points, after surgery ? 92.2 ñ 10.4 points; on the IKDC scale before surgery ? 68.2 ñ 10.6 %, after surgery ? 90.1 ñ 9.5 %. KT-1000 ? 3.7 ñ 1.4 mm, AOSAF ? 95.3 ñ 7.5 %. An autograft rupture within 2 years after the surgery was detected in 4 out of 50 patients, which amounted to 8 %. Measurements on the PKS-01 plantograph 24 months after the operation did not reveal changes in the arch of the foot. In group 2, the average score on the Tegner Lysholm scale before surgery was 70.2 ñ 11.6 points, after surgery it was 94.3 ñ 8.7 points. The mean value on the IKDC scale before surgery was 68.6 ñ 8.7 %, after surgery it was 91.5 ñ 8.2 %. KT-1000 ? 3.4 ñ 1.2 mm. Autograft rupture within 2 years after the surgery was detected in 3 out of 50 patients, which amounted to 6 %. Conclusion The results of the operations performed in the two groups can be assessed as good, no statistically significant differences were found, which indicates that the peroneus longus tendon autograft is an alternative option for primary ACL repair. ?

1103,SC-486,Olewnik et al. (2022),2022,"The relationship between additional heads of the quadriceps femoris, the vasti muscles, and the patellar ligament","Introduction. The quadriceps femoris consists of four muscles: the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis. However, the effect of additional quadriceps femoris heads on the vasti muscles and patellar ligaments is unknown. The aims of the present study are to determine the relationship between additional quadriceps femoris heads and the vasti muscles and patellar ligaments and to review the morphology of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius. Materials and Methods. One hundred and six lower limbs (34 male and 19 female cadavers) fixed in 10% formalin were examined. Results. On all lower extremities, the vastus lateralis consisted of superficial, intermediate, and deep layers. The vastus medialis, on the other hand, consisted of only the longus and obliquus layers. The quadriceps head had one or more supplementary heads in 106 dissected limbs from 68 cadavers (64.1%). The distal portion of the patella was wider in lower limbs without supplementary heads than in type IA but narrower than in type IIIA. In general, the distal portion of the patella was narrower in specimens with a supplementary head than in those without (19.03 SD 3.18 mm vs. 20.58 SD 2.95 mm, p=0.03817). Other patellar ligament dimensions did not differ significantly. Conclusion. The quadriceps femoris muscle is characterized by high morphological variability. Occurrence of extra heads is at the level of 64.1%. The vastus lateralis consists of three parts (superficial, intermediate, and deep), and vastus medialis consists of two (longus and oblique). ? 2022 ?ukasz Olewnik et al.",Scopus,10.1155/2022/9569101,BioMed Research International

It is suggested that neuromuscular training could improve dynamic postural balance and proprioception in basketball players with functional ankle instability (FAI). Method: Randomized controlled clinical trial. The sample consisted of 27 female basketball players between the ages of 15 and 17, belonging to a Sports Club in the Maip£ city (Santiago, Chile). 13 of them assigned to the control group and 14 to an experimental group. This last group received a neuromuscular intervention of 6 weeks, of 2 non-consecutive days. Both extremities were worked on stable, unstable surfaces, with and without visual inhibition. Postural balance was measured with the SEBTm test and proprioception through an active joint repositioning test. Results: both the control and experimental groups significantly improved postural balance, however, the experimental group showed greater percentage changes and larger effect sizes (ES).The greatest change in the control group was 7.8% in the posterolateral direction of the SEBTm (p=0.046; ES=0.74). In the experimental group, the greatest change was 21% in the anterior direction of the SEBTm (p=0.001; ES=2.2). In the active repositioning test, no significant changes were observed in the control group, while the experimental group improved up to 82.8% in the hip joint (p=0.001; ES=2.72). Conclusion:A six-week neuromuscular training improved dynamic postural balance and proprioception in female basketball players with IFT. ?

1105,SC-488,Regauer et al. (2022),2022,Evidence?Based Surgical Treatment Algorithm for Unstable Syndesmotic Injuries,"Background: Surgical treatment of unstable syndesmotic injuries is not trivial, and there are no generally accepted treatment guidelines. The most common controversies regarding surgical treatment are related to screw fixation versus dynamic fixation, the use of reduction clamps, open versus closed reduction, and the role of the posterior malleolus and of the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL). Our aim was to draw important conclusions from the pertinent literature concerning surgical treatment of unstable syndesmotic injuries, to transform these conclusions into surgical principles supported by the literature, and finally to fuse these principles into an evidence-based surgical treatment algorithm. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the reference lists of systematic reviews of relevant studies dealing with the surgical treatment of unstable syndesmotic injuries were searched independently by two reviewers using specific terms and limits. Surgical principles supported by the literature were fused into an evidence?based surgical treatment algorithm. Results: A total of 171 articles were included for further considerations. Among them, 47 articles concerned syndesmotic screw fixation and 41 flexible dynamic fixations of the syndesmosis. Twenty?five studies compared screw fixation with dynamic fixations, and seven out of these comparisons were randomized controlled trials. Nineteen articles addressed the posterior malleolus, 14 the role of the AITFL, and eight the use of reduction clamps. Anatomic reduction is crucial to prevent posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Therefore, flexible dynamic stabilization techniques should be preferred whenever possible. An unstable AITFL should be repaired and augmented, as it represents an important stabilizer of external rotation of the distal fibula. Conclusions: The current literature provides sufficient arguments for the development of an evidence?based surgical treatment algorithm for unstable syndesmotic injuries. ? 2022 by the authors.

1106,SC-489,Fan et al. (2022),2022,Age-related alterations of hyaluronan and collagen in extracellular matrix of the muscle spindles,"Background: Muscle spindles (MSs) play a crucial role in proprioception and locomotor co-ordination. Although the elasticity and viscosity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within which MSs are embedded may play a key role in MS function, the impact of aging on ECM components is unclear. The aim of the current study was to investigate the age-related physiological changes of the ECM and to verify if these could be due to alterations of the environment directly surrounding MSs. Methods: Hematoxylin Eosin and picrosirius-red staining was carried out; collagen types I (COLI) and III (COLIII) were assessed, and biotinylated hyaluronan binding protein (HABP) immunohistochemical analysis was undertaken to evaluate alterations of the ECM in the intramuscular connective tissue (IMCT) of the hindlimbs of C57BL/6J male mice. Assessments were carried out on 6-week-old (Group A), 8-month-old (Group B), and 2-year-old (Group C) laboratory mice. Results: The capsule?s outer layer became progressively thicker with aging (it was 3.02 ñ 0.26 æm in Group A, 3.64 ñ 0.31 æm in Group B, and 5.81 ñ 0.85 æm in Group C). The collagen in IMCT around and within the MSs was significantly higher in Group C, but there were no significant differences between Groups A and B. The MS capsules and continuous IMCT were primarily made up of COLI and COLIII. The average optical density (AOD) values of COLI in IMCT surrounding MS were significantly higher after aging (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in COLIII in the three groups (p > 0.05). HA was present in IMCT and filled the MSs capsule. The AOD of HABP of MS showed that there were lower HA levels in Group C with respect to Group A (p = 0.022); no significant differences were noted neither between Groups A and B nor between Groups B and C (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Age-related collagen accumulation and lower HA in the ECM in which the MSs were embedded may probably cause more stiffness in the ECM in vivo, which could help to partly explain the peripheral mechanisms underlying the age-related decline in functional changes related to MSs. ? 2021 by the authors.

1107,SC-490,Saito et al. (2022),2022,Influence of Age on Signal Intensity of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Outcomes in Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Comparisons Among Different Age Groups,"Background: Thus far, the clinical results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction have been observed to be comparable between young and older patients. In contrast, age-related changes in the structural and mechanical properties of tendons used for autografts have been described. However, age-related changes associated with graft maturation remain poorly understood. Hypotheses: The hypotheses of this study were that (1) clinical outcomes after ACL reconstruction would be comparable between younger and relatively older patients and (2) younger patients would show lower signal intensity changes on magnetic resonance imaging scans indicative of graft maturation that would be better than that in relatively older patients. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 236 patients who underwent double-bundle ACL reconstruction via the outside-in technique using hamstring autograft between January 2012 and December 2015. The patients were categorized by age into 3 groups: <20 years old, 20 to 39 years old, and ò40 years old. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner activity scale, Lysholm score, and objective assessment of joint laxity 24 months after surgery. In addition, graft maturation was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging?derived measures of the signal intensity ratio (SIR) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Clinical outcomes and graft maturation were compared among the 3 groups. Results: The SIR of both bundles increased from 3 months to 12 months and decreased by 24 months, showing the same tendency in all groups. No significant difference was found in the SIR among the 3 groups at any time point (P >.05). The IKDC score was significantly lower in the ò40-year group than in the <20-year group (P <.01). In contrast, no significant differences were noted in other clinical outcomes. Conclusion: Patients aged ò40 years exhibited lower IKDC scores compared with younger patients, although the results of graft maturation were comparable. ? 2021 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/03635465211059158,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1108,SC-491,Karykowska et al. (2022),2022,Musculus peroneus longus in foetal period,"Background: The lateral compartment of the leg, due to its distal and concurrent superficial positioning, is a multiple trauma site. Detailed knowledge of compartimentum lateralis cruris (CLC) structure is crucial for physicians. Musculus peroneus longus (MPL) is located within the structures of the CLC most superficially. There is a lot of data on the morphology of the MPL but there is no publication analysing in detail its anatomy in the foetal period. The aim of the study was to determine the variability of metric and morphological parameters of MPL in a studied period of prenatal ontogenesis. Materials and methods: The analysis included 207 human foetuses (101 males and 106 females) at calendar age from 113 to 222 days. The analysed material comes from the local anatomy collection. Foetuses were stored in typical preservation solutions. Access to the muscle was obtained on the basis of standard preparation techniques. The authors evaluated the metric parameters of the muscle showing the presence of variable dynamics of metric increments of the examined muscle in particular age classes. Results: In the studied period of prenatal ontogenesis, MPLs of the foetuses increased by about 60% in the length and width dimension and by about 100% in the thickness dimension. The topography of the initial and final muscle attachment was also evaluated. Statistically significant dimorphic differences were found in some aspects of muscle attachment topography. Conclusions: The analysis of the place of the origin and insertion of MPL showed a relatively large variety of these features. ? 2022 Via Medica",Scopus,10.5603/FM.A2020.0129,Folia Morphologica (Poland)

(2022),2022,Running gait biomechanics in females with chronic ankle instability and ankle sprain copers,"Limited evidence exists comparing running biomechanics between individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and those who fully recover (copers). The purpose of this study was to simultaneously analyse running gait kinematics, kinetics, and surface electromyography (sEMG) between ankle sprain copers and individuals with CAI. Twenty-six (13 CAI, 13 Coper) recreationally active females participated and ran shod on an instrumented treadmill at 2.68 m/s. We assessed lower extremity kinematics and kinetics and sEMG amplitude for the fibularis longus, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, and gluteus medius muscles. Ten consecutive strides from the beginning of the trial were analysed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) independent t-test. The CAI group had significantly more ankle inversion during 0?6%, 42?53%, and 96?100% of the running stride cycle compared to the coper group. At initial contact (0%), the CAI group was in an inverted ankle position (5.9øñ6.8ø) and the coper group was in an everted ankle position (?3.2øñ5.5ø; p =ÿ0.01, d =ÿ1.5). There were no significant differences identified for any other outcome measures. Increased ankle inversion during the swing phase leading into the loading phase is concerning because the ankle is in an open packed position and inversion is a primary mechanism of injury for sustaining a lateral ankle sprain. ? 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,10.1080/14763141.2021.1977378,Sports Biomechanics

Methods: Ten fresh?frozen human cadaveric lower extremities were used to harvest a full-thickness PLT autograft using a standard closed blunt-ended tendon stripper. The distance to the sural nerve from the PLT (at 0, 1, 2 and 3ÿcm proximal to lateral malleolus (LM), and the distance to the peroneal nerve and its branches from the end of the tendon stripper were measured by two separate observers using ImageJ software. Results: The average distance from the PLT to the sural nerve increased significantly from 0 to 2ÿcm proximal to LM. The average distance to the sural nerve at the LM was 4.9 ñ 1.5ÿmm and increased to 10.8 ñ 2.4ÿmm (2ÿcm proximal to LM). The average distance from the tendon stripper to the deep peroneal nerve was 52.9 ñ 11.4ÿmm. The average distance to the PLT branch of peroneal nerve was 29.3 ñ 4.2ÿmm. The superficial peroneal nerve, which coursed parallel and deep to the tendon stripper, was on average 5.2 ñ 0.7ÿmm from the end of the stripper. No transection injuries of the nerves were observed in any of the ten legs after harvesting.

(2022),2022,Outcomes of Tibialis Anterior Tendon Reconstruction with Autograft or Allograft,"Background: In cases of tibialis anterior tendon (TAT) ruptures associated with significant tendon defect, an interposition graft is often needed for reconstruction. Both auto- and allograft reconstructions have been described in the literature. Our hypothesis was that both graft types would have a good integrity and provide comparable outcomes. Methods: Patients who underwent TAT reconstruction using either an auto- or allograft were identified. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) questionnaire, the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score, the Foot Function Index (FFI), and the Karlsson-Peterson score. Functional outcome was assessed by isokinetic strength measurement. Outcomes were further assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of graft integrity. All measurements were also performed for the contralateral foot. Results: Twenty-one patients with an average follow-up of 82 months (20-262 months), comprising 12 allograft and 9 autograft TAT reconstructions, were recruited. There were no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between allograft reconstructions and autografts: SF-12 (30.7 vs 31.1, P =.77); AOFAS (83 vs 91.2, P =.19); FFI (20.7% vs 9.5%, P =.22); and Karlsson-Peterson (78.9 vs 87.1, P =.23). All grafts (100%) were intact on MRI with a well-preserved integrity and no signs of new rupture. There were no major differences in range of motion and functional outcomes as measured by strength testing between the operative and nonoperative side. Conclusion: Reconstructions of TAT achieved good PROs, as well as functional and imaging results with a preserved graft integrity in all cases. There were no substantial differences between allograft and autograft reconstructions. Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective case series. ?

1112,SC-495,Kim et al. (2022),2022,Peak Forces and Force Generating Capacities of Lower Extremity Muscles During Dynamic Tasks in People With and Without Chronic Ankle Instability,"People with chronic ankle instability (CAI) exhibit neuromuscular deficits. However, no study has investigated deficits in forces or force-generating capacities of individual muscles in people with CAI during dynamic tasks. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to estimate and compare peak forces and force-generating capacities of individual muscles during dynamic tasks in people with CAI and healthy controls (CON). Eleven people with CAI and eleven CON performed landing, anticipated cutting, and unanticipated cutting as motion capture, force plate, and electromyography data were recorded. A musculoskeletal model was used to estimate the force and force-generating capacity of lower extremity muscles. People with CAI exhibited greater gluteus maximus force and force-generating capacity than CON during all tasks. In addition, people with CAI exhibited greater force-generating capacity of the vastii muscles than CON during the unanticipated cutting task. These findings suggest that, during dynamic tasks, people with CAI exhibit a neuromuscular control strategy that is characterised by differences in peak forces and force-generating capacities of proximal muscles, which may allow them to compensate for previously described deficits in distal muscles. ? 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,10.1080/14763141.2020.1869295,Sports Biomechanics

1114,SC-497,Phatama et al. (2021),2021,Higher rate of patellofemoral problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring autograft,"BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral problems are not uncommon among post-anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction patients. Hamstring autograft harvesting-related factor is one of the suspected causes. A lack of tibiofemoral internal rotation force due to strength deficit causes the patella tends to shift laterally. AIM: Peroneus longus tendon has been proposed as an alternative graft source due to its adequate tensile strength and minimal donor site morbidity to the knee biomechanics, including the patellofemoral joint. This tendon does not cross the knee joint and thus does not affect patellofemoral alignment and biomechanics. This study aims to compare patellofemoral problems between hamstring and peroneus longus autograft harvested patients following ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one subjects who underwent primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction between September 2018 and September 2019 and met the inclusion criteria were grouped into the hamstring group (n = 16) and peroneus longus group (n = 15). Both groups were evaluated retrospectively. The follow-up assessment was conducted on the phase II rehabilitation program. The assessed variables were pain, crepitus, and the Indonesian-validated Kujala score. RESULTS: No significant differences in pain and crepitus were found between both groups. There were significant differences in the Kujala score between both groups (p < 0.001). The peroneus longus group reported an averagely higher score than the hamstring group. CONCLUSION: Single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft produces less patellofemoral symptoms and functional limitation than using hamstring tendon autograft. ? 2021 Krisna Yuarno Phatama, Romy Darmawansa, I Gusti Ngurah Arga Aldrian Oktafandi, Felix Cendikiawan, Alva Pribadi, Lasa Dhakka Siahaan, Sholahuddin Rhatomy, Edi Mustamsir.",Scopus,10.3889/oamjms.2021.6626,Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences
1115,SC-498,Bitter et al. (2021),2021,Firework injuries are increasing in the United States: An analysis of the National Emergency Department Sample,"Background: Firework-related injuries cause significant morbidity to persons in the United States and globally. Prior studies have shown that hands and eyes are frequently injured, with loss of hand function and blindness being common after serious injury. Many jurisdictions in the United States have relaxed laws governing sales of consumer fireworks in recent years. Given the increased availability of consumer fireworks, we sought to determine the incidence of firework-related injuries compared with historical controls. Methods: Firework-related injuries were identified in the National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) using the corresponding International Classification of Disease codes for the years 2008?2017. Demographics, timing of presentation, and hospital characteristics were analyzed. Data were weighted to approximate population estimates of injury. Statistical analyses were completed using SAS. The National Electronic Surveillance System was also queried for firework-related visits to check for consistency in observed trends. Results: There were an estimated 7699 injuries attributed to fireworks in 2017 (2.37 per 100,000 population) compared with 5727 (1.88 per 100,000 population) in 2008. The majority of victims were male (74.6%), and injuries clustered in the pediatric and young adult age groups. The Midwest and South (both 38.1%) had more firework-related injuries compared with the West (15.6%) and Northeast (8.2%) regions. Most visits occurred in July (71.4%) with smaller peaks in June (6.9%) and January (6.0%). Patients were disproportionately seen in trauma centers (34.0%) and teaching hospitals (49.6%). Conclusion: Emergency department visits for firework injuries are increasing in the United States. Pediatric patients and young adult males comprise the majority of victims. Injuries are clustered around the Fourth of July and New Year's holidays. Public health interventions targeted at high-risk groups may reduce the burden of injury. ? 2021 The Authors.

1116,SC-499,Rhatomy et al. (2021),2021,Comparing the Stiffness of Peroneus Longus Tendon Versus Hamstrings in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Biomechanical Study,"Background: The use of autografts originating from either hamstring tendons or peroneus longus tendons is a surgical option in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Objectives: This research aimed to compare the tensile strength between the hamstring tendon and the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The hypothesis of this study was: Peroneus longus grafts have tensile strength equal to hamstring grafts based on living donor patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study was a biomechanical study examining means and standard deviations (SD) by comparing the tensile strength of peroneus longus tendons and hamstring tendons when used as autograft donors in ACL reconstruction. Results: In this study, 51 patients with reconstructive ACL were enrolled. The mean diameter of the hamstring tendon was 7.86 with SD ñ 0.69, while the mean diameter of peroneus longus tendon was 7.67 with SD ñ 0.63. The mean diameter of the peroneus longus graft was not significantly different. The mean displacement on the hamstring tendon was 2.44 with SD ñ 0.42, while the peroneus longus tendon was 2.06 with SD ñ 0.14. The peroneus longus tendon had significantly more tensile strength compared to the hamstring tendon. Conclusions: Diameter of the peroneus longus graft was not significantly different from the hamstring graft. However, the peroneus longus graft had more tensile strength than the hamstring graft based on living donor patients. ? 2021, Author(s).",Scopus,10.5812/asjsm.110160,Asian Journal of Sports Medicine

This study also investigated whether the occurrence of patellar ligament thickening (PLT), which is commonly observed 2 months postoperatively after TPLO, is associated with misplacement of the osteotomy. A total of 120 dogs weighing more than 20 kg, 40 of which were control animals, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Stifles were radiographically evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively on the side with CCLR and on the healthy contralateral side and compared with clinically normal stifles. PLT was reassessed after 2 months. Results: Significant decreases in median patellar height ratio were found after both procedures (TPLO 0.24 (0.05?0.8); CCWO 0.22 (0.05?0.4)). The postoperative craniocaudal patellar position and the median AMA angle differed significantly among the groups (P =ÿ0.000) (TPLO 87.5% caudal to the AA and 3.12ø (0.76?6.98ø); CCWO 100% cranial to the AA and 0ø (? 1.34?0.65ø); control group 5% caudal to the AA and 0.99ø (0?3.39ø)). At 8 weeks, PLT grade differed significantly in the two operated groups (P =ÿ0.000) (TPLO 40% 0?2, 20% 2?4, 40% > 4; CCWO 98.8% 0). Conclusions: TPLO and AMA-based CCWO are associated with significant decreases in patellar height; however, the PLT results 2 months postoperatively differed between the two groups; the decrease in patellar height and PLT were independent of osteotomy position in the TPLO group. Compared to TPLO, CCWO results in reduced postoperative AMA angles and craniocaudal patellar positions that more closely resemble those of unaffected dogs, suggesting that the CCWO procedure allows us to better correct the caudal bowing of the proximal tibia that is often associated with deficient stifles in large dogs with TPA > 30ø. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s12917-021-03094-3,BMC Veterinary Research

One hundred and thirty-four lower limbs of body donors (52 woman and 82 man) fixed in 10% formalin solution were examined. The popliteus muscle was present in all 134 limbs. Four main types were identified with subtypes. The most common type was Type I (34.3%), characterized by a single tendon in the popliteus sulcus. Type II (30.6%) characterized by a main tendon in the popliteus sulcus and accessory bands. This type was divided into five subtypes (A?E) based on presence of specific accessory bands. Type III (15.3%) was characterized by two tendons in the popliteal sulcus. Type IV (19.4%) was characterized by two tendons in the popliteus sulcus and additional bands. This type was also divided into five subtypes (A?E) based on presence of specific accessory bands. The popliteofibular ligament was present in 90.3% of cases. A new classification based on a proximal attachment is proposed. The popliteus tendon is characterized by a very high morphological variability, which can affect posterolateral knee stability and the natural rotation of the tibia. Such a classification system may be useful for clinicians performing medical procedures within the knee joint, including orthopedic surgeons. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-021-93778-5,Scientific Reports

(2021),2021,Impact of plantaris ligamentous tendon,"There are countless morphological variations among the muscles, tendons, ligaments, arteries, veins and nerves of the human body, many of which remain undescribed. Anatomical structures are also subject to evolution, many disappearing and others continually emerging. The main goal of this pilot study was to describe a previously undetected anatomical structure, the plantaris ligamentous tendon, and to determine its frequency and histology. Twenty-two lower limbs from 11 adult cadavers (11 left, and 11 right) fixed in 10% formalin were examined. The mean age of the cadavers at death was 60.1ÿyears (range 38?85). The group comprised six women and five men from a Central European population. All anatomical dissections of the leg and foot area accorded with the pre-established protocol. Among the 22 lower limbs, the PLT was present in 16 (72.7%) and absent in six (27.3%). It originated as a strong fan-shaped ligamentous tendon from the superior part of the plantaris muscle, the posterior surface of the femur and the lateral aspect of the knee joint capsule. It inserted to the ilio-tibial band. Histologically, a tendon and ligament were observed extending parallel to each other. A new anatomical structure has been found, for which the name plantaris ligamentous tendon is proposed. It occurs around the popliteal region between the plantaris muscle, the posterior surface of the femur, and the ilio-tibial band. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-021-84186-w,Scientific Reports

(2021),2021,Clinical outcome after knee ligament reconstruction with tendon allografts,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical outcome for patients after knee ligament reconstructions with allografts at a university hospital. Methods: A total of 33 patients received allografts for reconstructive knee surgery between 2007 and 2017. The follow up evaluation consisted of a clinical knee examination including evaluation of range of motion (ROM), lateral and medial laxity, the Lachman test, the Pivot shift test, the sag test, the posterior drawer test and checking for patellofemoral pain. The following patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were used; the Lysholm Function Score, the Tegner activity score, and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Results: Twenty-one (64%) patients were available for the follow-up evaluation and the mean follow-up time was 4.8ÿyears. A total of 16 out of 21 patients had multiligament injuries of which the ACL was the ligament most frequently ruptured. At the time of follow-up, 14 out of 16 patients (87%) with ACL injury had Lachman test grade 0 or grade 1 + , and 12 out of 13 (92%) had a pivot shift grade 0 or 1 +. The mean Lysholm Score was 74.

A computed tomography scan of full-length tibia and fibula was obtained. Models were built after three-dimensional reconstruction. The corresponding plates and screws were constructed and assembled together with fracture models. FEA was performed and contourplots were output. The Von Mises stresses of nodes and displacements of elements were extracted. Student?s t test was used to compare the values of Von Mises stresses and displacements between corresponding models. Differences in Von Mises stresses and displacements of fragments and implants between models with and without TT were nearly all statistically significant. However, the displacements of fragments and implants for all models were < 2ÿmm. TT in fracture models had larger Von Mises stresses than TT in intact tibial model. However, displacements of TT in fracture models showed similar or even smaller results to those in intact tibial model. Although almost all the tested parameters were statistically significant, differences were small and values were all below the clinical threshold. This study could promote open reduction and internal fixation with one-stage reconstruction for treatment of tibial plateau fractures associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1038/s41598-021-81401-6,Scientific Reports

(2021),2021,The predictive factors that are associated with the number of sutures used during meniscal repair,"Purpose: To investigate factors associated with the consumption of a large number of sutures during arthroscopic meniscus repair procedures. Methods: All patients who received meniscal repair, with or without concomitant anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2019 were included in the current study. Demographic data (sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and injury-to-surgery interval) and surgical data (the site of the tear, side of the meniscus, presence of an ACL rupture or not and the number of sutures) were retrospectively collected from our medical records. The number of sutures was divided into two groups (1?2 sutures versus > 2 sutures). The stitching process was implemented through an all-inside technique using a meniscal repair device (Fast-Fix; Smith & Nephew). According to the length and stability of the meniscal tear, one to seven sutures were used. Univariate analysis consisted of chi-square tests. Multivariate logistic regression was then performed to adjust for confounding factors. Results: A total of 242 patients, including 168 males and 57 females, was finally included. In the univariate analysis, we found that those patients who underwent meniscus repair within one month after meniscus tear were more likely to need fewer sutures than those who underwent surgery more than one month after injury (70/110 versus 59/115, p=0.062). In total, 75/109 (68.8%) lateral meniscal tears were repaired with fewer sutures than medial (34/72, 47.2%) and bilateral meniscus injuries (20/44, 45.4%; p=0.003). In the multivariate analysis, we found that the duration of injury (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.16?3.64, p=0.013), presence of an ACL injury (OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.97?7.21, p< 0.001) and the side of the meniscus (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14?0.65, p=0.002) were associated with the number of sutures used during meniscal repair procedures.

(2021),2021,Outcomes of one-stage reconstruction for chronic multiligament injuries of knee,"Purpose: This article aims to evaluate patterns of chronic multiligament injuries and outcomes of treatment with single-stage reconstruction using autografts. Methods: All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6 weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years? follow-up. Results: A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48 ñ 9.9 years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2%) or chondral (40.7%) injuries. At the 2 years? follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p = 0.0001) IKDC score (p = 0.0001), Lysholm score (p = 0.0001), and range of motion (p = 0.001). None of the patients had residual laxity on clinical examination of the knee joint at the 2 years? follow-up. All but two of the patients went back to their previous activity level. These two patients had progressive knee arthritis and needed knee arthroplasty. Conclusion: Single-stage surgical reconstruction for chronic MKI has favourable functional outcomes.

However, iatrogenic injury to the nervous structures about the knee is possible if care is not taken with surgical approaches and technique. Injuries to the saphenous nerve and peroneal nerve in particular have been described in association with routine arthroscopic procedures, meniscal repair, ligamentous reconstructions, high tibial osteotomies, and total knee arthroplasty. Understanding the injury mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of these injuries begins with a detailed familiarity with the neural anatomy about the knee. Prompt identification of nerve injury is important and requires a discerning sports medicine practitioner to maintain a high index of suspicion in the appropriate situations.

(2021),2021,Immediate effects of footwear with vibration applied to the swing phase of the gait cycle on dynamic balance in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy,"Sensory and sub-sensory foot vibration have beneficial effects on the static and dynamic balance of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Previous foot vibration during walking was applied at sub-sensory threshold in both stance and swing phases of the gait cycle in DPN. This study aimed to investigate the effects of footwear with vibration above the sensory threshold applied to the swing phase of the gait cycle on the dynamic balance of DPN. Fifteen patients with DPN and 10 matched healthy control participants were enrolled in this study. Dynamic balance assessment was investigated by the sit to stand and turn tests while electromyography activity (root mean square, RMS) of the vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA), and peroneus longus (PL) muscles were recorded at baseline, after 10 min of wearing the vibratory sandal without vibration, and after 10 min of wearing the sandal with vibration. Repeated measure analysis of variance was conducted for data analysis. Wearing the vibratory sandal slightly increased the speed of weight transfer in both groups and COP sway in DPN (P > 0.05), and close to significant decrease of turn sway (P = 0.07) in both groups. There were significant differences of the PL RMS in turn test (P = 0.03) in DPN and peak RMS of the PL after 10 min of wearing the sandal with vibration in both groups (P < 0.05). The results of the present study demonstrated that PL activity was significantly influenced by the vibratory sandal as its tendon passing across the sole and in direct contact with the source of the vibration. ? 2021",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110710,Journal of Biomechanics

Various surgical techniques have been reported to address these conditions, in either an open or an arthroscopic manner. However, a simple and effective method is still being pursued. We introduce a mini-invasive PLC reconstruction technique in which a single tendon is used to reconstruct the lateral collateral ligament, the popliteofibular ligament and the popliteal tendon simultaneously. The critical points of this technique are proper location and creation of the tibial, fibular and femoral tunnels, proper passing and setting of the tendon graft, as well as protection of the peroneal nerve. Our clinical experience indicates that this technique is easy to perform and effective.

(2021),2021,Three-in-One Procedure for Revision ACL Reconstruction,"Revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a challenge due to the unfavorable condition of the knee and the lack of autogenous graft tissue. Anterolateral structure (ALS) reconstruction of the knee has been proved effective to address the unfavorable condition in revision cases, and lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) is a special technique that can enhance anterolateral stability of the knee without graft tissue. We introduce a procedure that combines ACL and ALS reconstruction, as well as LET for failed ACL reconstruction. The critical point of this technique is using the anterior half of the iliotibial band to realize LET and to partially reconstruct the ACL. Our clinical experience indicates this technique is extremely useful in revision ACL reconstruction without enough free graft tissue. This technique will provide a reasonable choice in revision ACL reconstruction. ? 2021 Arthroscopy Association of North America. Published by Elsevier.

1130,SC-513,Fogleman et al. (2021),2021,Augmented Spring Ligament Repair in Pes Planovalgus Reconstruction,"Patients with pes planovalgus deformity often have coexisting spring ligament pathology. A primary repair of the ligament may fail during weightbearing due to chronic degeneration of the ligamentous tissue. Augmentation with a suture tape has been suggested to strengthen the repair. Limited data exist regarding flatfoot reconstruction with augmented spring ligament repair using a suture tape. This is a review of 57 consecutive patients who had flatfoot reconstruction with concomitant spring ligament augmented repair between July 2014 and August 2017. Weightbearing radiographic parameters were obtained preoperatively and compared to radiographs at an average time of 62 ñ 46.5 (range 20-220) weeks postoperative. Significant improvements were seen in the radiographic parameters evaluated. Five patients had subsequent operations including one deep infection, 2 hardware removals remote to the spring ligament augmentation, 1 ankle arthrodesis, and 1 triple arthrodesis. Concomitant spring ligament repair augmented with a suture tape was a safe procedure that contributed to radiographic correction in a consecutive series of 57 patients undergoing flatfoot deformity correction. ? 2021 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons",Scopus,10.1053/j.jfas.2021.05.010,Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery
1131,SC-514,G”kler et al. (2021),2021,The effect of sterilization and storage on the viscoelastic properties of human tendon allografts,"Allografts have become increasingly preferred for anterior cruciate ligament replacement purposes. The risk of infections necessitates thorough sterilization procedures, and the allografts usually need to be stored prior to surgery. Classical mechanical tests have been performed with various types of tendons, however, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus tend to suffer the least biomechanical changes after irradiation. Only few results are available of the strain and creep behaviour of tendons, even though this information is necessary to provide suitable allografts. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of different tendon types (T-tibialis anterior, P-peroneus longus), sterilization methods (G-gamma irradiation of 21 kGy, E-electron beam irradiation of 21 kGy) and storage times (5 and 6 months) on the creep behavior, which is characterized by the strain at the end of the loading phase and creep deformation after static loading. Static creep tests were performed with 250 N load during 60 s. Deformation at the end of the loading phase of both tendons was significantly smaller after 5 months long storage than that after 6 months long storage. TE5 showed significantly less creep than group TE6, and TE6 significantly greater than PE6. The creep of TE5 was significantly lower than that of TG5. Based on the data, the peroneus longus sterilized by electron beam and stored deep frozen for 5 months is a better choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than tibialis anterior sterilized by gamma irradiation stored for 6 months. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110697,Journal of Biomechanics

To improve the clinical outcomes of PCL reconstruction, preservation of the remnant has long been a consideration. However, how to make the remnant-preservation technique simple and more effective is of concern.

(2021),2021,Electromiographic activity during single leg jump in adolescent athletes with chronic ankle instability: A pilot study,"Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a common condition in athletes, which can alter the muscular activity of lower limb during jump. The objective of the study was to verify the magnitude of activation, onset timing and order of recruitment of the proximal and local muscles to the ankle of young athletes with CAI during a single leg vertical jump. Thirty-seven athletes were selected and divided into: 1) CAI group and 2) control group. An electromyographic evaluation was performed during the jump on force plate. The muscles evaluated were the proximal muscles - gluteus medius (GMed), rectus femoris (RF) and local ankle muscles - tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG). In propulsion, the CAI group showed early activation of all evaluated muscles, when compared to control group (p = 0.05). No diferences were found between groups concerning magnitude of electromyographic signal and order of muscle recruitment. During landing, an increase in magnitude of the electromyographic signal of TA in the CAI group was observed and no diferences were found between groups for onset activation and order of muscle recruitment. The results can be applied to athletes' rehabilitation through specific neuromuscular control exercises, such as reaction time and local and proximal joint stabilization to optimize muscle performance and injury incidence. Therefore, in the single leg vertical jump athletes with CAI presented higher activation of the TA in the landing and an early activation of the GMed, RF, TA, PL and LG in propulsion in relation to control group. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbmt.2021.06.001,Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies

In instances of isolated symptomatic non-repairable anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) injury, there is a surgical indication for isolated ATFL reconstruction. However, we feel that the typical gracilis tendon graft is not always appropriate. Interest in using the plantaris tendon as a graft has picked up since a biomechanics study found the tensile strength of a quadrupled plantaris tendon is comparable to that of the ATFL.

1137,SC-520,Kwon et al. (2021),2021,Electromyographic analysis of ankle muscles in chronic ankle instability during sudden inversion according to visual information provision,"Background: Chronic ankle instability is a condition in which the ankle is repetitively giving way, with symptoms such as pain, muscle weakness, and proprioceptive deficits. Therefore, people with chronic ankle instability require complex and systematic interactions between sensory association and the musculoskeletal system. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in ankle muscle activities and reaction times during sudden ankle inversion in chronic ankle instability patients under different visual conditions. Material and Methods: Twenty-eight subjects with chronic ankle instability were recruited for the study. All subjects performed a trapdoor platform that was inversion by 25 degrees. This study assessed muscle activity and muscle reaction time during sudden ankle inversion three times with a 60-second rest period between tests with eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Results: Muscle activities of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis were significantly diminished with eyes closed, whereas that of gastrocnemius was not significantly different. No significant changes in tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis, and gastrocnemius reaction times were observed during sudden ankle inversion in the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Conclusions: Blocking visual information can lower tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis muscle activities during postural perturbation in subjects with chronic ankle instability. These results provide insight into the injury mechanism and causes of injury, and thus to improve the existing preventive appliances. ? 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Scopus,10.1016/j.orthtr.2020.12.002,Sports Orthopaedics and Traumatology
1138,SC-521,Stough et al. (2021),2021,Examining Conditions Supporting the Development of Anomalous Charge Structures in Supercell Thunderstorms in the Southeastern United States,"Hypotheses regarding favorable conditions for anomalous charging have primarily resulted from studies within the Great Plains region of the United States, where the efficiency of warm precipitation processes is thought to be fundamental. Rare observations of anomalous charge structures in the Southeastern region challenge existing conceptual models used to explain anomalous charging. As a rigorous evaluation of conditions that support anomalous charge structures, environmental characteristics and bulk kinematic and microphysical properties of two normal and two anomalous supercell thunderstorms observed in the Southeast were compared. Within the anomalous supercells, greater quantities of precipitation ice were identified at higher altitudes and colder temperatures, suggesting a greater depth of riming growth and increased vertical transport of rimed hydrometeors. Deeper anomalous supercell updrafts were larger and stronger in the upper mixed-phase and glaciated regions. However, normal supercells were characterized by more robust low-level updrafts, resulting in comparable warm cloud residence times that suggested warm precipitation processes were not necessarily less efficient in the anomalous supercells. Indications of enhanced mixed-phase liquid water content in favor of anomalous charging were observed in the anomalous supercells, though contrasts in related environmental parameters were not as large as observed in other comparative studies. Anomalous supercell environments were characterized by increased instability, shallower warm cloud depth, as well as lower relative humidity in the 700?500ÿmb layer. Evidence of impacts from dry air in anomalous storm structures suggested that water vapor content may have affected particle-scale charge transfer in support of anomalous charge structure development. ? 2021.

(2021),2021,Reconstruction for Chronic ACL Tears with or without Anterolateral Structure Augmentation in Patients at High Risk for Clinical Failure: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Background:The purpose of this trial was to determine whether anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with anterolateral structure augmentation (ALSA) would result in better clinical outcomes in patients with a high risk of clinical failure.Methods:From February 2017 to June 2018, 120 young, active adults with chronic anterior cruciate ligament injury and high risk of clinical failure were randomized. The patients were followed for >2 years, with 5 being lost to follow-up and 1 being withdrawn from the study. Clinical characteristics, operative findings, and postoperative clinical outcomes were analyzed.Results:The analysis included data from 114 patients, including 95 men and 19 women with a mean age (and standard deviation) of 30.1 ñ 6.7 years in the ACLR group and 30.1 ñ 6.4 years in the ALSA group. The rate of clinical failure was 20.4% (11 of 54 patients) and 3.3% (2 of 60 patients) in the ACLR and ALSA groups, respectively (difference, 17.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3% to 29.8%; p = 0.007). Significantly higher rates of return to the preinjury level of sports (48.3% versus 27.8%; difference, 20.5%; 95% CI, 2.7% to 36.6%; p = 0.024) and to a competitive level of play (63.3% versus 42.6%; difference, 22.3%; 95% CI, 4.1% to 38.8%; p = 0.027) was found in the ALSA group.Conclusions:Compared with isolated ACLR, combined ACLR and ALSA resulted in a reduction in persistent rotatory laxity and higher rates of return to preinjury and competitive levels of play at 2 years of follow-up in the population studied. Our study suggests that patients with high risk of clinical failure appear to be candidates for the ALSA approach.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level I.

1140,SC-523,Kim et al. (2021),2021,Muscle force contributions to ankle joint contact forces during an unanticipated cutting task in people with chronic ankle instability,"The purpose of this study was to compare muscle force contributions to ankle joint compression and anteroposterior shear forces between people with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and healthy controls (CON) during an unanticipated cutting task. Eleven people with CAI and 11 CON performed an unanticipated cutting task as three-dimensional motion capture, ground reaction force (GRF), and muscle activation data were collected. A musculoskeletal modeling was used to calculate talocrural joint compression and anteroposterior shear forces and parse out the contributions to these forces from ankle-spanning muscles and from GRF. Independent t-tests were used for statistical analysis. People with CAI exhibited greater anterior shear force peaks during early (p = 0.048, d = 0.98) and late (p = 0.017, d = 1.21) stance compared to CON. The difference in early stance shear force appeared to arise from greater GRF contribution (p = 0.026, d = 1.12) in CAI group, whereas the difference in late stance shear force appeared to arise from greater contribution of lateral gastrocnemius (p = 0.026, d = 1.12), medial gastrocnemius (p = 0.048, d = 0.98), tibialis posterior (p = 0.017, d = 1.22), fibularis brevis (p = 0.035, d = 1.05), and fibularis longus (p = 0.023, d = 1.15). People with CAI exhibit greater anterior shear, but not compressive forces in talocrural joint during an unanticipated cutting task. The differences in anterior shear force were the result of passive and active contributions from GRF during early stance and lower leg muscles during late stance, respectively. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110566,Journal of Biomechanics

The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the developed parallel process model in injury prevention in students. Materials & Methods This experimental study was conducted in 2020-21 with 240 male students in Sanandaj who were randomly and equally divided into experimental and control groups. The intervention consisted of two 90-minute training sessions in the form of lectures, questions, and answers, group discussions, and screenings of related videos. The researcher-made questionnaire based on the model constructs of the developed parallel process, the validity, and reliability of which were confirmed, was used before the intervention and two months after the intervention. Data were analyzed by independent t-test and logistic regression analysis using SPSS 16 software. Findings The mean age of students was 15.82ñ1.05 years. There was no significant difference in fireworks behavior between the two groups before the intervention, and 88% of the students used explosives during the Charshanbeh Suri ceremony. The results of the logistic regression test before the intervention showed that the perceived threat predicted the non-use of incendiary materials. The effectiveness of the educational intervention caused the students in the experimental group to be in the path of risk control, and the use of incendiary substances after the intervention in the experimental group was significantly reduced (p<0.001). Conclusions Education with the content of sensitization and fear and efficiency is an appropriate educational intervention in reducing Charshanbeh Suri events in adolescents. ? 2021 Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.

Twenty-three adults, 12 with CAI and 11 healthy participants, participated in this study. All subjects underwent a tensiomyographic assessment of the PL and TA to measure delay time, contraction time and maximal displacement. The ankle evertor and invertor normalized peak torques, maximum work done and muscle thickness of the PL and TA were calculated. The delay time and contraction time of the PL in the CAI side were significantly higher than those in the healthy group (p < 0.05); however, no significant difference could be detected in the TA between groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the normalized peak torques, maximum work done and muscle thickness of the PL and TA between groups. The CAI side demonstrated a delayed muscle contractile response of the PL when compared with the healthy group although there was no difference in muscle strength and muscle size. Clinicians should consider the muscle contractile response of the PL for rehabilitation of the ankle evertor with CAI. ? 2021 by the authors.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) provides surgical restoration of the injured ACL using the placement of graft material. The choice of graft is principal in providing optimal knee stability after surgery. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is an autograft modality that offers unique benefits for ACL reconstruction cases. Presentation of case: We present a case of ACL reconstruction surgery using PLT graft in a patient with a confirmed ACL rupture. Assessment of post-surgical pain, knee stability, and ankle function were performed to determine functional outcome and donor site morbidity. The follow-up results revealed favorable recovery and improvement in all objective parameters. Discussion: Post-operative biomechanical outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) score. The use of PLT in ACL reconstruction established an excellent potential for its satisfactory result and comparable to other graft modalities in widely used evidence-based findings. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon may be considered the first-option graft in ACL reconstruction as it indicated the absence of significant post-operative morbidity. ? 2021",Scopus,10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.106028,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports

Methods: A clinical data of 30 patients with PCL injury, who were admitted between December 2015 and September 2018 and met the selection criteria, was retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon and TightRope technique. Among them, 19 were male and 11 were female, aged 17-48 years (mean, 28.2 years). The PCL injury was caused by traffic accident in 8 cases, sport in 14 cases, falling and bruising by a heavy objective in 5 cases, and other injuries in 3 cases. The interval between injury and operation was 10-90 days (mean, 39.3 days). The PCL injury was rated as grade ? in 6 cases and grade ? in 24 cases. The posterior drawer test was positive in 26 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 24 cases. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 61.37ñ8.49, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was near normal in 2 cases, abnormal in 8 cases, and significantly abnormal in 20 cases. The modified Lysholm knee score was 62.20ñ5.67. The knee range of motion (ROM) was (101.83ñ8.15) ø. Results: The operative time ranged from 70 to 110 minutes (mean, 79.7 minutes). All incisions healed by first intetion. All patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 19.0 months). There were 3 cases of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity after operation, and 1 case of approximately 10ø limitation of knee extension. At last follow-up, the posterior drawer test was positive in 2 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 1 case, with significant differences compared with the preoperative period ( ?2=38.571, P=0.000; ?2=36.274, P=0.000). The IKDC score was 84.67ñ3.67, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was normal in 16 cases, nearly normal in 10 cases, abnormal in 3 cases, and significantly abnormal in 1 case; the modified Lysholm knee score was 90.37ñ4.49; all of the above indexes were significantly better than preoperative ones, and the differences were significant ( t=-12.387, P=0.000; Z=-2.810, P=0.005; t=-22.865, P=0.000). Knee ROM was (88.33ñ9.86)ø at 1 month after operation and reached (113.33ñ13.48)ø at last follow-up, showing significant differences between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05). MRI re-examination showed that the form and position of reconstructed PCL were satisfactory.

This review introduces the key architectures of GANs as well as their technical background and challenges. Key research trends are highlighted, including: (a) reconstruction of high-resolution MRI; (b) image synthesis with different modalities and contrasts; (c) image enhancement that efficiently preserves high-frequency information suitable for human interpretation; (d) pixel-level segmentation with annotation sharing between domains; and (e) applications to different musculoskeletal anatomies. In addition, an overview is provided of the key issues wherein clinical applicability is challenging to capture with conventional performance metrics and expert evaluation.

(2021),2021,Alterated ligamento-muscular reflex pattern after stimulation of the anterior talofibular ligament in functional ankle instability,"Purpose: Ligamento-muscular reflex pattern following stimulation of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) was examined. Methods: The peroneus longus (PL), the tibialis anterior (TA), and tibialis posterior (TP) muscles were investigated in sixteen patients with functional ankle instability (FAI) and 16 age- and gender-matched controls. The ATFL was stimulated with a fine wire electrode while electromyographic (EMG) activities were recorded during isometric foot contraction of 20% maximal force in plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, supination and pronation. The complete measurement was repeated after a peroneal block anesthesia. Results: Statistically significant changes in post-stimulus EMG activity were observed in all three muscles and all four tested foot positions. In supination, the PL showed no reactions in both groups before and after anesthesia. The post-stimulus inhibition of the TA seen after 80 and 180ÿms disappeared in controls after anesthesia. The TP had similar inhibitory responses in both groups. Conclusion: Ligamento-muscular reflex pattern is alterated in FAI. While early reactions are essential in protecting the ankle joint in sudden movements, the later responses indicate a supraspinal control of neuromuscular stability of the ankle joint. Proprioceptive rehabilitation of the PL, TA, and TP is crucial in FAI to compensate for post-traumatic ligamentomuscular reflex deficiencies.

Aberrant gait biomechanics contribute to PTOA and are attributable in part to quadriceps dysfunction. Vibration improves quadriceps function following ACLR, but its effects on gait biomechanics are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) and local muscle vibration (LMV) on gait biomechanics in individuals with ACLR. Seventy-five volunteers (time since ACLR 27 ñ 16 months) were randomized to WBV, LMV, or Control interventions. Walking biomechanics were assessed prior to and following a single exposure to the interventions. Outcomes included pre-post change scores in the ACLR limb for the peak vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and its loading rate, peak internal knee extension (KEM) and abduction moments, and peak knee flexion and varus angles. LMV produced a significant decrease in the vGRF loading rate (?3.6 BW/s) that was greater than the changes in the WBV (?0.3 BW/s) and Control (0.5 BW/s) groups. Additionally, WBV produced an increase in the peak KEM (0.27% BW ? Ht) that was greater than the change in the Control group (?0.17% BW ? Ht) but not the LMV group (0.01% BW ? Ht). Lower KEM and greater loading rates have been linked to declines in joint health following ACLR. WBV acutely increased the peak KEM and LMV decreased loading rates. These data suggest that vibration has the potential to mitigate aberrant gait biomechanics, and may represent an effective approach for reducing PTOA risk following ACLR. ? 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Making use of these tissues may be helpful for the reconstructed ACL from many aspects. There are many methods of remnant preservation and use, as well as many types of combined ACL reconstruction. However, the most effective methods of remnant reuse as well as ACL reconstruction are still being pursued. We introduce an anatomical double-bundle transtibial ACL reconstruction with in-between remnant preservation technique named sandwich-style ACL reconstruction. The indication of this technique is complete ACL tear with a large volume of connectable remnant. The main tricks of this technique are proper ligation of the remnant, proper location of the anteromedial-bundle tibial tunnels, and passing the anteromedial bundle through the shallow side of the remnant. We believe the introduction of this technique will provide more options for remnant preservation and ACL reconstruction. ? 2021 Arthroscopy Association of North America. Published by Elsevier.

Trapezius transfer is biomechanically favorable due to the similar vector of the transferred muscle to the native posterior superior rotator cuff. Regarding combined tendon grafting in trapezius transfer, onto-surface tendon attachment to the humerus was reported in most previous reports. For better tendon?humeral head connection, we introduce an humeral bone tunnel?based tendon grafting technique. In this technique, we use the hamstring tendons and the anterior half of the peroneus tendon to make 3 grafts. The most critical steps of this technique are the proper creation of the humeral tunnels and graft implantation. We consider the introduction of this technique will shed light in the field of trapezius transfer for Irreparable posterior rotator cuff tears. ? 2021 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

(2021),2021,Anterior tibial translation and patient-reported outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a tape locking screw: A 5-year follow-up study,"Background: The Tape Locking Screw system (TLS) is a recognised technique used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, only a few previous studies have reported associated outcomes, all of which had been examined over a short-term period. The aim of this study was to assess the time-dependent changes in the objective and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) in a group of patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency who have been operated on with this technique. Hypothesis: Previously reported satisfactory short-term outcomes following TLS persist for several years after the operation. Patients and methods: This study was a retrospective observational study including 26 patients, who were followed after unilateral ACLR with TLS. Anterior tibial translation (ATT) was measured in both knees using the KT-1000 arthrometer and two PROMs: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm subjective form scores were examined preoperatively, 6 months postoperatively, and annually for 5 years thereafter in all patients. Results: One patient suffered a rupture of the graft, and one patient had a screw loosening. Two patients were lost for follow-up, so 22 patients were the final study group. Median (25?75%) ATT side-to-side differences between the injured and uninjured sides were 4 (3,5?4) mm preoperatively, 0,75 (0?1) mm 1 year postoperatively, and 0,75 (0?1) mm 5 years after the operation (P < 0.001). Median (25?75%) IKDC scores were 44.25 (35.6?55.15), 92.55 (87.08?96.6), and 95.4 (90.8?97.7) points preoperatively and 1 year (P < 0.001) and 5 years postoperatively, respectively. Median (25?75%) Lysholm scores were 52 (38.75?64.5), 95.5 (94.75?99.25), and 97.5 (95?99) points preoperatively and 1 year (P < 0.001) and 5 years postoperatively, respectively. Discussion: ACLR with TLS might already achieve favourable outcomes 1 year postoperatively, when measured objectively (ATT) and with PROMs. These outcomes persist 5 year postoperatively.

Methods: Patients with an isolated PCL injury underwent single-bundle PCL reconstruction using consecutive sampling. Patients were allocated into two groups (PLT and HT) and prospectively observed. The tendon graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, Lysholm, and modified Cincinnati scores) were recorded preoperatively and 2ÿyears postoperatively. The thigh circumference and functional score according to the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) were recorded to evaluate the morbidities in the ankle. Results: Fifty-five patients (hamstring n = 27, peroneus n = 28) met the inclusion criteria. The diameter of the PLT graft (8.2 ñ 0.6ÿmm) was comparable to that of the HT graft (8.3 ñ 0.5ÿmm). Both groups had excellent postoperative knee functional outcome scores. The mean AOFAS and FADI scores were excellent, with no difference in thigh circumference between the groups. Conclusion: PLT is a good choice as a graft in PCL reconstruction at the 2-year follow-up, with minimal donor site morbidity.

1157,SC-540,Sun et al. (2021),2021,Evaluation of the effectiveness of electrical muscle stimulation on human calf muscles via frequency difference electrical impedance tomography,"Objectives. The human skeletal muscle responds immediately under electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), and there is an immediate physiological response in human skeletal muscle. Non-invasive quantitative analysis is at the heart of our understanding of the physiological significance of human muscle changes under EMS. Response muscle areas of human calf muscles under EMS have been detected by frequency difference electrical impedance tomography (fd-EIT). Approach. The experimental protocol consists of four parts: pre-training (pre), training (tra), post-training (post), and relaxation (relax) parts. The relaxation part has three relaxation conditions, which are massage relaxation (MR), cold pack relaxation (CR), and hot pack relaxation (HR). Main results. From the experimental results, conductivity distribution images å p (p means protocol = pre, tra, post, or relax) are clearly reconstructed by fd-EIT as response muscle areas, which are called the M 1 response area (composed of gastrocnemius muscle) and the M 2 response area (composed of the tibialis anterior muscle, extensor digitorum longus muscle, and peroneus longus muscle). A paired samples t-test was conducted to elucidate the statistical significance of spatial-mean conductivities å p M1 and å p M2 in M 1 and M 2 with reference to the conventional extracellular water ratio ? p by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Significance. From the t-test results, å p M1 and å p M2 have good correlation with ? p . In the post-training part, å post and ? post were significantly higher than in the pre-training part (n = 24, p < 0.001). The relax-pre difference ratios of spatial-mean conductivity ?å relax-pre and the relax-pre difference ratios of extracellular water ratio ?? relax-pre in both MR and CR were lower; on the contrary, the ?å relax-pre and ?? relax-pre in HR were significantly higher than those in post-pre difference ratios of spatial-mean conductivity ?å post-pre (n = 8, p < 0.05). The reason for the changes in å p M1 and å p M2 are caused by the changes in muscle extracellular volumes. In conclusion, fd-EIT satisfactorily evaluates the effectiveness of human calf muscles under EMS. ? 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Scopus,10.1088/1361-6579/abe9ff,Physiological Measurement
1158,SC-541,Blanke et al. (2021),2021,Does the anterolateral ligament protect the anterior cruciate ligament in the most common injury mechanisms? A human knee model study,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction still has a risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Thus, extra-articular structures such as the anterolateral ligament (ALL) are increasingly treated. The ALL however prevents the internal rotation of the tibia and it must be doubted that the ALL protects the ACL in other common injury mechanisms which primarily include tibial external rotation. In this study we aimed to evaluate which extra-articular structures support the ACL in excessive tibial internal and external rotation using a knee finite element (FE) model. Methods: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to an FE model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Three additional anatomic structures (anterolateral ligament, popliteal tendon and posterior oblique ligament) were added to the FE model separately and then all together. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. Results: The ACL was the most loaded ligament both in tibial internal and external rotation. The ALL was the main stabilizer of the tibial internal rotation (46%) and prevented the tibial external rotation by only 3%. High forces were only observed in the LCL with tibial external rotation. The ALL reduced the load on the ACL in tibial internal rotation by 21%, in tibial external rotation only by 2%. The POL reduced the load on the ACL by 8%, the PLT by 6% in tibial internal rotation. In tibial external rotation the POL and PLT did not reduce the load on the ACL by more than 1%. Conclusion: The ALL protects the ACL in injury mechanisms with tibial internal rotation but not in mechanisms with tibial external rotation. In injury mechanisms with tibial external rotation other structures that support the ACL need to be considered. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.knee.2021.02.026,Knee
1159,SC-542,Zwirner et al. (2021),2021,Assessment of plantaris and peroneus tertius tendons as graft materials for ankle ligament reconstructions ? A cadaveric biomechanical study,"Both the plantaris tendon and the peroneus tertius tendon are used as auto- and allogenous graft materials to reconstruct the ankle ligament complex. However, it is unclear to what extent these graft materials resemble the load-deformation behavior of the ankle ligaments. A total of 34 human ankle ligaments and 35 tendons were assessed mechanically deploying a quasi-static tensile testing setup. Tendons were significantly stiffer (median elastic moduli: plantaris tendon = 465.7 MPa, peroneus tertius tendon = 338.5 MPa, medial ligament = 61.4 MPa, lateral ligament = 49.3 MPa; p ó 0.035), but more distensible (median strain at maximum force: plantaris tendon = 15.1%, peroneus tertius tendon = 15.3%, medial ligament = 9.3%, lateral ligament = 9.6%; p ó 0.008) and mechanically tougher (median ultimate tensile strength: plantaris tendon = 51.0 MPa, peroneus tertius tendon = 40.5 MPa, medial ligament = 4.1 MPa, lateral ligament = 3.5 MPa; p ó 0.033) when compared to medial and lateral ankle ligaments. The lateral ligaments of the right ankle were significantly tougher compared to the left side (p = 0.015). The elastic modulus of the medial ligament (r = 0.489, p = 0.045) and the peroneus tertius tendon (r = 0.517, p = 0.014) yielded an age-dependent increase. Both tendons seem biomechanically suitable graft materials to replace the medial and lateral ankle ligaments during physiological loading. The age-dependent increase in tissue elastic properties of the medial vs. lateral ankle ligaments, and differences in ultimate tensile strength between the lateral ligaments left vs. right, may reflect the complex asymmetric loading behavior of both ankle ligaments. ? 2020 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2020.104244,Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials
1160,SC-543,Karauda et al. (2021),2021,Morphological variability of the extensor hallucis longus in human fetuses,"Introduction: The extensor hallucis longus originates from about the middle three fifths of the anterior surface of the fibula, medial to the origin of the extensor digitorum longus, and inserts into the distal phalanx of the great toe. The goal of this study was to examine the insertion of the extensor hallucis longus tendon and thus prepare its first classification in human fetuses. Material and Methods: Fifty spontaneously-aborted human fetuses (26 male, 24 female, 100 lower limbs), aged 18?38 weeks of gestation, were examined. Results: The classification comprised three types of extensor hallucis longus insertion. The most common was type I (68%), which was characterized by a single tendon that ends as an extensor hood inserting into the dorsal aspect of the base of the distal phalanx of the great toe. The second most frequent was type II (27%), which was characterized by two distal tendons: the dominant one ends as an extensor hood inserting into the distal phalanx of the great toe, and the auxiliary inserts separately into the dorsal aspect of the proximal phalanx of the great toe, medial to the insertion of the extensor hallucis brevis tendon. Finally, type III (5%), the least frequent type, was characterized by two distal tendons: the dominant one ends as an extensor hood inserting into the distal phalanx of the great toe, and the auxiliary connects to the tendon of the extensor hallucis brevis. Conclusion: The extensor hallucis longus demonstrates great variability in the approach of its tendon to the foot, at least in fetuses, as indicated by this initial classification. ? 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Scopus,10.1016/j.aanat.2020.151627,Annals of Anatomy

(2021),2021,Reconstruction of Concomitant Ruptures of Peroneus Longus and Brevis Tendons: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Peroneal tendon ruptures are caused by inversion trauma of the ankle and are often mistaken for simple ankle sprains. As a result, peroneal tendon ruptures are underdiagnosed; especially a concomitant rupture of both the brevis and longus tendons is extremely rare. We describe the case of concomitant rupture of both peroneal tendons in a 50-year-old male, diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging and treated with a flexor digitorum longus tendon transfer. The flexor digitorum longus tendon was mobilized, transferred laterally, and anchored to the distal and proximal stubs of the peroneal tendons, acting like a bridge. At final follow-up (19 months after index surgery), the patient was relieved from his symptoms and had full range of motion. Imaging demonstrated a durable reconstruction. Evidence for the preferred surgical treatment is lacking in the current literature and is limited to small case series and case reports. Randomized prospective studies should be conducted to determine the optimal treatment. Based on current available data, surgical technique should be based on clinical observation (e.g., tendon quality) and imaging findings. ? 2020",Scopus,10.1053/j.jfas.2020.09.007,Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery

Fifteen women with regular menstrual cycles and 17 male counterparts were included in this study. Electromyographic signals were recorded from the peroneus longus (PL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles while performing three balance tasks. Muscle tone, stiffness, and elasticity of muscles were measured using a MyotonPRO in the resting position. Outcomes were measured twice (ovulation and early follicular phases) for women, while measurements were acquired only once for men. Significantly higher tibialis anterior-peroneus longus co-contraction (TA/PL ratio) was observed in all balance tasks in women than in men (p< 0.05); however, significant differences between phases of the menstrual cycle were noted only in the 2 most difficult tasks (p< 0.05). A similar pattern was observed in the postural sway. These results highlight the importance of sex-specific hormonal effects on neuromuscular control and mechanical properties, and as well as the differences during phases of the menstrual cycle. These insights assume significance in the context of developing neuromuscular strategies for the purpose of preventing lower extremity injuries during sports activities. ? 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Methods: Between January 2016 and December 2018, 46 patients with PCL injuries were enrolled. There were 34 males and 12 females, with an average age of 40.7 years (range, 20-58 years). There were 43 cases of acute injury and 3 cases of old injury. The anterior drawer test and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 4 cases, the posterior drawer tests and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 46 cases, the varus stress tests were positive in 10 cases, and the valgus stress tests were positive in 6 cases. The difference of dial-test at 30ø knee flexion between affected and healthy sides was (5.20ñ3.91)ø. The tibia posterior displacement under posterior stress position was (12.03ñ2.38) mm. The Lysholm score of the knee joint was 36.68ñ7.89, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 33.58ñ5.97, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Association (AOFAS) score of the ankle joint was 97.60ñ1.85. PCL was reconstructed with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy, and the combined meniscus injury, posterolateral complex injury, and anterior cruciate ligament injury were all treated according to the degree of injury. Results: All incisions healed by first intention. Forty patients were followed up 12-26 months, with an average of 16.0 months. At last follow-up, the Lysholm score of the knee joint was 84.85ñ7.03, and the IKDC score was 87.13ñ6.27, which were significant different from preoperative ones ( t=-13.45, P=0.00; t= -39.12, P=0.00); the AOFAS score of ankle joint was 93.98ñ2.14, which was not significant different from preoperative one ( t=8.09, P=0.90). The tibia posterior displacement under posterior stress position was (2.75ñ1.76) mm and the difference of dial-test at 30ø knee flexion between affected and healthy sides was (1.75ñ2.09)ø, which were significant different from preoperative ones ( t=29.00, P=0.00; t=4.96, P=0.00). The posterior drawer test and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 1 case and negative in 39 cases; the anterior drawer test and the varus and valgus stress tests were all negative. Conclusion: Reconstruction of PCL with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy can significantly improve the stability and function of the knee joint, with satisfactory clinical results.",Scopus,10.7507/1002-1892.202008051,Chinese Journal of Reparative and Reconstructive Surgery

(2021),2021,Concussion Is Associated With Increased Odds of Acute Lower-Extremity Musculoskeletal Injury Among National Basketball Association Players,"Purpose: To determine the odds of sustaining an acute lower-extremity (LE) musculoskeletal injury during the 90-day period after return-to-play (RTP) from concussion in National Basketball Association (NBA) athletes. Methods: Concussion data for NBA players were collected from the 1999-2000 to 2017-2018 seasons, from publicly available sources. Age, position, injury, time to RTP, and demographic factors were collected. The 90-day period after each case of concussion was reviewed for acute noncontact LE musculoskeletal injury. Control athletes without a documented history of concussion were matched to concussed athletes by age, body mass index, position, and experience. Conditional logistic regression with a calculated odds ratio and a 95% confidence interval were used to assess the association between concussion and subsequent risk of LE injury. Results: In total, 189 concussions were documented in 153 athletes. Of these, 140 cases were the first recorded instance of concussion in players with publicly available data. Thirty-six (25.7%) athletes sustained a LE injury within 90 days of concussion; 26 (20.2%) were non?season-ending and included in RTP analysis. The odds of sustaining an acute LE musculoskeletal injury within the 90-day period after concussion was 4.69 times greater in concussed players compared with controls (95% confidence interval 1.96-11.23, P <.001). There was no significant difference in games (4.2 ñ 5.0 vs 4.7 ñ 4.7 games, P =.566) or days (18.5 ñ 39.1 days vs 10.9 ñ 10.6 days, P =.912) missed between concussed players with LE injury and nonconcussed controls. The most common LE injuries in concussed athletes were ligament sprains/tears (65%). Conclusions: Concussed NBA athletes have increased odds for sustaining an acute LE musculoskeletal injury within 90 days of RTP compared with nonconcussed controls. The most common injuries were ligament strains or tears. Changes in neuromotor control and proprioception following a concussion should be evaluated in high-level basketball players returning to sport.

Despite a considerable amount of sensorimotor-related evidence and clinical outcomes analysis being available, little is known about the effects of CS-induced sensory afferent input on corticomuscular functional connectivity (corticomuscular coherence, CMC) and reaction time (RT). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of wearing CS on CMC and sensorimotor performance. Methods: Fourteen healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study and randomly performed visual tracking motor task, RT test and joint position sense (JPS) test with and without CS (CS and non-CS conditions). Electroencephalography and electromyography of the wrist extensor during the visual tracking motor task were used to calculate CMC. Joint angle steadiness, joint position error, pre-motor time (PMT), electromechanical delay (EMD) time and RT were calculated to compare sensorimotor performance with and without CS. Results: When wearing CS decreased CMC, shortened both PMT and RT compared to the non-CS condition (p <.05). The JPS and the steadiness of the wrist joint were improved when CS was worn (p <.05). Conclusion: Our findings indicated that wearing CS altered CMC and improved sensorimotor function. ? 2021, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",Scopus,10.1007/s40846-021-00601-7,Journal of Medical and Biological Engineering

This technique offers a more stable, fast, low-cost, and widely accessible procedure and consists of drilling 3 tunnels?1 femoral and 2 tibial tunnels?in which the grafts are fixed with interference screws. The fact that the peroneus longus graft is long and thick allows for robust reconstruction of the aforementioned ligaments. ? 2020 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2020.10.030,Arthroscopy Techniques
1167,SC-550,Schilaty et al. (2021),2021,Biomechanical muscle stiffness measures of extensor digitorum explain potential mechanism of McArdle sign,"Background: McArdle sign is a phenomenon of impaired gait and muscle weakness that occurs with neck flexion, immediately reversible with neck extension. A recent report measured the specificity of this sign for multiple sclerosis by measuring differences in peak torque of the extensor digitorum between neck extension and flexion. Methods: This substudy included 73 participants (29 multiple sclerosis, 20 non-multiple sclerosis myelopathies, 5 peripheral nerve disorders, and 19 healthy controls). The effect of neck position was assessed on muscle stiffness and neuromechanical error of the extensor digitorum. Findings: Patients with multiple sclerosis had greater neuromechanical error (sum of squared error of prediction) compared to controls (P = 0.023) and non-multiple sclerosis myelopathies (P = 0.003). Neuromechanical error also provided improved sensitivity/specificity of McArdle sign. Peak torque, muscle stiffness, and neuromechanical error could distinguish multiple sclerosis from other myelopathies with 80% specificity and 97% sensitivity (AUC = 0.95). Interpretation: A decrease in muscle stiffness and neuromechanical error in neck flexion compared to extension are additional indicators for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Analysis of muscle stiffness may provide insights into the pathophysiology of this specific clinical sign for multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, muscle stiffness may provide an additional accurate, simple assessment to evaluate multiple sclerosis therapeutic interventions and disease progression. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2021.105277,Clinical Biomechanics

(2021),2021,Evaluation of knee stability after simulated reconstruction of the core ligament of the posterolateral complex,"BACKGROUND: Injury of the posterolateral complex of the knee joint is a common type of multiple ligament injuries of the knee joint. The reconstruction of the posterolateral complex can restore the posterior and lateral stability of the knee joint and rebuild the stability of the knee joint. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the feasibility and clinical effect of modified LaPrade method for functional reconstruction of posterolateral complex of knee with autograft peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: Fourteen patients with posterolateral complex and posterior cruciate ligament injuries who were treated in the Department of Orthopedics, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University from October 2014 to March 2017 were enrolled in this study. Posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral complex were simultaneously constructed in stage one. The injury of the posterolateral complex of the knee joint was Fanelli type C. Modified LaPrade method was used to functional reconstruction of posterolateral complex of knee with peroneus longus tendon. The anatomy and function of the core ligament of the posterolateral complex was simulated. Follow-up time was beyond 1 year. The tibia posterior displacement on stress radiographs, lateral compartment gapping on varus stress radiographs at 0ø knee extension, and external rotation angle of tibia at 30ø knee flexion were compared before and after surgery. The joint function was evaluated according to the score of International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm Knee score. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) All patients were followed up for 12-18 months. All patients had no knee-length restriction, with flexion limitation in some patients. (2) At the last follow-up, the tibia posterior displacement on stress radiographs, lateral compartment gapping on varus stress radiographs and external rotation angle of tibia at 30ø knee flexion were reduced from preoperation, with statistically significant differences (P=0.000). (3) The International Knee Documentation Committee function was corrected from D preoperatively to A in 8 cases and B in 6 cases postoperatively. The average Lysholm score was increased from (32.4ñ5.6) preoperatively to (82.7ñ6.4) postoperatively, and the differences were statistically significant (P=0.000). (4) It is indicated that with peroneus longus tendon, the anatomy and function of the core ligament of the posterolateral complex were simulated by modified LaPrade method to functional reconstruction of posterolateral complex of knee, and the postoperative knee function recovered well. ? 2021, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

(2021),2021,Community Click,"Local governments still depend on traditional town halls for community consultation, despite problems such as a lack of inclusive participation for attendees and difficulty for civic organizers to capture attendees' feedback in reports. Building on a formative study with 66 town hall attendees and 20 organizers, we designed and developed CommunityClick, a communitysourcing system that captures attendees' feedback in an inclusive manner and enables organizers to author more comprehensive reports. During the meeting, in addition to recording meeting audio to capture vocal attendees' feedback, we modify iClickers to give voice to reticent attendees by allowing them to provide real-time feedback beyond a binary signal. This information then automatically feeds into a meeting transcript augmented with attendees' feedback and organizers' tags. The augmented transcript along with a feedback-weighted summary of the transcript generated from text analysis methods is incorporated into an interactive authoring tool for organizers to write reports. From a field experiment at a town hall meeting, we demonstrate how CommunityClick can improve inclusivity by providing multiple avenues for attendees to share opinions. Additionally, interviews with eight expert organizers demonstrate CommunityClick's utility in creating more comprehensive and accurate reports to inform critical civic decision-making. We discuss the possibility of integrating CommunityClick with town hall meetings in the future as well as expanding to other domains. ? 2021 ACM.",Scopus,10.1145/3432912,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction

Materials and methods Tendon material was collected on the base of the IrkutskRegional Bureau of Forensic Medicine. The main stage of the mechanical strength study of graft models was carried out at the NationalResearch Irkutsk State Technical University, the Department of Strength of Materials, using universal tension testing desk-standingmachine Shimadzu AGS-10kNXD. The mechanical strength of graft models of tendon of the semitendinosus and peroneal longusmuscles, prepared by a known method (GraftLink technique) was defined. Statistical data processing was carried out using the statisticalsoftware Statistica for Windows 10.0 (StatSoft Inc., USA; license holder is the Irkutsk Scientific Center of Surgery and Traumatology).We used a nonparametric method for defining the statistical significance of differences, i.e. the Mann-Whitney test. Differences in thecompared groups were considered statistically significant in p < 0.01. Results The mechanical strength of the graft harvested from thesemitendinosus muscle tendon according to the known technique averaged out at 351.8 ñ 133.0 N, and the mechanical strength of thegraft from the half of the peroneus longus tendon, prepared in a known manner, averaged out at 632.4 ñ 193.7 N.

(2021),2021,Evaluation of polymeric biomaterial as an option for tissue replacement in plantar calcaneonavicular ligament injuries,"Spring ligament is a structure responsible for giving stability to the plantar arch of the foot. Some injuries or rupture of this ligament can have consequences such as flat feet or induce the foot to have greater ranges of motion of pronation and abduction. The solutions proposed over time have been to reconstruct the ligament through autograft or allograft surgery, however, research and results have shown that this is a temporary, partial solution, or even a new way to worsen the previous problem. In this research, new tissue engineering technologies will be used to obtain a Scaffold from synthetic and natural polymers that give the new ligament mechanical and biological properties, respectively, to obtain a tissue as close to the native one. A solution of 50% PCL-50% type II collagen, at a concentration of 10%w/v, was prepared. The solution was electrospun under an align fibers configuration. The sample obtained was characterized in a uniaxial equipment obtaining values of: Ultimate tensile stress = 1.375MPa; Young's modulus = 7.767MPa; Poisson's ratio = 0.1. These mechanical properties were attached to a healthy foot model provided by [2], to evaluate the performance of the new SL properties versus the healthy model. The tissues primarily involved in plantar arch stabilizers: FP, LPL and SPL, were evaluated. Due to the elastic properties of the material, the computational model of the foot, presented high loads on the mentioned tissues, also displacements that discrepancy from the healthy ones. The electrospun scaffold does not yet meet the specifications to act as a possible graft with successful mechanical properties that would allow the spring ligament to withstand the loads without foot collapse or excessive pronation. ? 2021 IEEE.",Scopus,10.1109/CI-IBBI54220.2021.9626057,0

Methods: In this Cross-Sectional study, 42 young physically active (exercising three times per week regularly) males participated in this study, including 21 with hyper-pronated feet and 21 with normal feet. Each participant completed a running and cutting task. Body postural control was measured using a force platform (1000Hz) which was synchronized with surface electromyography of selected ankle muscles. MATLAB software was used to process and analyze the data. One-away ANOVA was used to identify any differences between groups. Results: Differing muscle activation patterns in the surrounding ankle musculature (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus) through to reduced postural stability in the medial-lateral direction and increased vertical ground reaction forces were observed between groups. Conclusion: According to the obtained results it seems that subtalar hyper-pronation can be regarded as a factor affecting the biomechanics of cutting by changing activation patterns of the muscles surrounding the ankle, and reducing postural control of the body in medial-lateral direction, but not in anterior-posterior direction. ? 2021 Conseje?a de Educaci¢n y Deporte de la Junta de Andaluc??a. ?a de Educaci¢n y Deporte de la Junta de Andalu?a de Educaci¢n y Deporte de la Junta de Andaluc??a. ?a.

1177,SC-560,Budaev et al. (2021),2021,Materials used for knee ligament grafting,"The authors have presented the review of scientific literature on producing grafts intended for surgical reconstruction of ligament ruptures. The treatment of ligament ruptures in reconstructive plastic surgery could be performed by using synthetic grafts, autologous and allogenic grafts from tissue donors. Advantages of synthetic grafts include the possibility of their regular manufacturing under sterile conditions, and providing mechanical properties, high biocompatibility. However, synthetic implants significantly increase the risk of synovitis and other complications, they can not be replaced by the native tissue, and have no ability to regeneration. Autologous grafts have ideal tissue compatibility and quick biointegration, could be harvested from different anatomical sites, but commonly the graft harvesting is followed by donor site morbidity and potential risk of injury nerves, elongates operation time, bad cosmetic results. The use of autografts may be also limited by anatomical features of the patient. Allogenic ligament biomaterial could provide wide range of grafts, but in our days there is no standardized methods for ligament graft sterilization and long storage. Well-known sterilization methods, such as ionized radiation and chemical treatment, gave controversial results. One could conclude that estimation of ligament graft viability must include a complex study of biomechanical properties, cell and fibers integrity. ?

However, the effect of prophylactic ankle taping on lower-extremity kinematics is still not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of traditional taping, fibular repositioning taping, and kinesiology taping on the peak angles of the lower extremities in patients with CAI. Materials and Methods: A total of 14 men (age, 24.07 ñ 4.46 years; height, 175.06 ñ 5.10 cm; weight, 82.24 ñ 10.38 kg (mean ñ standard deviation)) with CAI identified using screening questionnaires (Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool, 17.64 ñ 4.14; Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) Activity of Daily Living, 86.69 ñ 6.71; and FAAM Sports Subscale, 75.45 ñ 6.70) participated. The peak angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints during a stop-jump task, with and without tape application, were collected using a three-dimensional motion system. Results: The following peak angles were measured: hip flexion, hip adduction (ADD), hip internal rotation (IR), knee flexion, knee abduction (ABD), knee IR, ankle dorsiflexion, ankle inversion, and ankle ADD. No significant differences were observed in the peak angle of each joint across conditions (hip flexion, F<inf>(3, 39)</inf> = 0.85, p= 0.47; hip ADD, F<inf>(1. 729, 22. 478)</inf> = 1.90, p= 0.18; hip IR, F<inf>(1. 632, 21. 220)</inf> = 0.67, p= 0.49; knee flexion, F<inf>(3, 39)</inf> = 1.24, p= 0.15; knee ABD, F<inf>(1. 691, 21. 982)</inf> = 1.24, p= 0.30; knee IR, F<inf>(1. 830, 23. 794)</inf> = 0.44, p= 0.63; ankle dorsiflexion, F<inf>(3, 39)</inf> = 0.66, p= 0.58; ankle inversion, F<inf>(1. 385, 18. 007)</inf> = 0.85, p= 0.40; ankle ADD, F<inf>(1. 865, 24. 249)</inf> = 2.23, p= 0.13). Conclusion: The application of different taping techniques did not significantly change the peak joint angles of the lower extremities during a stop-jump task. These results contradict those of previous studies, suggesting that ankle taping restricts joint range of motion. ? 2021. The Author(s).

To explore whether the eccentric muscle strength of both hip abductors and external rotators differ in participants with subacute lateral ankle sprain and healthy population, and to compare the Biodex balance measures as well. Material and methods. Thirty males diagnosed as a second degree ankle sprain enrolled in this study, while twenty-nine healthy volunteers considered as controls. The study measured both the peak eccentric torque for both hip abductors and external rotators using Biodex isokinetic dynamometer. All participants examined for bilateral and unilateral balance ability using Biodex balance system from erect position to determine total stability index (SI), anteroposterior index (API), and mediolateral index (MLI). Results. A detected significant negative correlation was obvious between peak eccentric isokinetic testing for hip external rotators torque; and total SI, API, and MLI of all the Biodex balance system measures for bilateral stance and API in unilateral stance. While, a moderate significant positive correlation found for peak eccentric isokinetic torques between both hip external rotators and abductors. Conclusion. Decreased hip muscle strength can increase the vulnerability of ankle ligaments via minimizing the postural control during weight-bearing activities, which, in turn, stimulates the compensatory neuromuscular mechanisms. ? 2021, DJ Studio.

(2021),2021,All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using an Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"Background: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been used as a graft in many orthopaedic surgical procedures because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. Purpose: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30ø of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. Results: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 ñ 0.62 vs 7.0 ñ 2.18 mm, respectively; P <.001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 ñ 8.27, 50.9 ñ 8.50, and 1.8 ñ 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 ñ 2.61, 95.2 ñ 2.64, and 6.8 ñ 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P <.001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively. No complications or reoperations occurred. Conclusion: All-inside ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft produced good functional scores and stability without obvious ankle-site morbidity. ?

1181,SC-564,Mullins et al. (2021),2021,Dry needling equilibration theory: A mechanistic explanation for enhancing sensorimotor function in individuals with chronic ankle instability,"Patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI) experience a dynamic interplay between impaired mechanical structures and sensorimotor deficiencies that contribute to recurrent sprains and sensations of instability. Concomitantly, muscular trigger points (MTrPs) are known to occur following trauma, maximal or submaximal concentric contractions, and unaccustomed eccentric loads. Additionally, MTrPs are theorized to be exacerbated in low-load and repetitive strain activities. MTrPs located within a muscle are associated with altered motor control, reaction delay, and decreased strength, deficits also found among those with CAI. Dry needling (DN) is reported to improve muscle range of motion, motor control, and pain in a myriad of neuromusculoskeletal conditions by decreasing spontaneous electrical activity and stiffness of taut muscle bands while improving filament overlap. Building on evidence supporting neuromechanical decoupling in chronic ligamentous injury with what is known about the development of MTrPs, this paper proposes a centrally mediated mechanism for improved sensorimotor function following DN for individuals with CAI. Dry needling equilibration theory (DNET) states that proprioception is improved following DN in the lower extremity by changing the muscle?s length?tension relationship and leveraging minor acute discomfort to improve muscle spindle afferent information via the gamma motor system. The application of DNET for individuals with CAI may provide a mechanistic explanation for improved descending cortical output, resulting in enhanced sensorimotor function. ? 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Scopus,10.1080/09593985.2019.1641870,Physiotherapy Theory and Practice

(2021),2021,"Concussion in National Football League Athletes Is Not Associated With Increased Risk of Acute, Noncontact Lower Extremity Musculoskeletal Injury","Background: Impaired neuromuscular function after concussion has recently been linked to increased risk of lower extremity injuries in athletes. Purpose: To determine if National Football League (NFL) athletes have an increased risk of sustaining an acute, noncontact lower extremity injury in the 90-day period after return to play (RTP) and whether on-field performance differs pre- and postconcussion. Study Design: Cohort study, Level of evidence, 3. Methods: NFL concussions in offensive players from the 2012-2013 to the 2016-2017 seasons were studied. Age, position, injury location/type, RTP, and athlete factors were noted. A 90-day RTP postconcussive period was analyzed for lower extremity injuries. Concussion and injury data were obtained from publicly available sources. Nonconcussed, offensive skill position NFL athletes from the same period were used as a control cohort, with the 2014 season as the reference season. Power rating performance metrics were calculated for ñ1, ñ2, and ñ3 seasons pre- and postconcussion. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine associations between concussion and lower extremity injury as well as the relationship of concussions to on-field performance. Results: In total, 116 concussions were recorded in 108 NFL athletes during the study period. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of an acute, noncontact lower extremity injury between concussed and control athletes (8.5% vs 12.8%; P =.143), which correlates with an odds ratio of 0.573 (95% CI, 0.270-1.217). Days (66.4 ñ 81.9 days vs 45.1 ñ 69.2 days; P =.423) and games missed (3.67 ñ 3.0 vs 2.9 ñ 2.7 games; P =.470) were similar in concussed athletes and control athletes after a lower extremity injury. No significant changes in power ratings were noted in concussed athletes in the acute period (ñ1 season to injury) when comparing pre- and postconcussion.

1183,SC-566,Ertogrul et al. (2021),2021,Is Peroneus Longus Allograft Good Alternative for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: a Comparison Study; Je alograft ?lachy m. peroneus longus vhodnou alternativou pro rekonstrukci p?edn¡ho zk?¡?en‚ho vazu: srovn vac¡ studie,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To compare the early clinical results of patients who had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with peroneus longus allograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 ñ 6.73, and 29.6 ñ 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision. Allograft ACL reconstruction is a good alternative to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon graft. ? 2021, Galen s.r.o..

1184,SC-567,Ji et al. (2021),2021,Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Clinical Treatment of Joint Complications and CT Observation,"Arthroscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing ACL injuries. It is a dual clinical technique for examination and treatment, which can effectively target the injury site for repair and treatment and can also accurately identify the lesion site and determine the degree of ligament injury through visual and three-dimensional observation of ligament injuries that are difficult to detect on imaging. However, this technique is invasive, so the clinic still needs to improve the related auxiliary imaging examination. In this paper, we performed MPR and VRT on patients with ACL injury and postprocessed the data. The diagnostic compliance rate of dual-source CT was 91.67% (33/36), the true positive rate was 93.33% (28/30), the missed rate was 6.67% (2/30), the true negative rate was 83.33% (5/6), and the misdiagnosis rate was 83.33% (5/6). The rate of true negative was 83.33% (5/6), and the rate of false diagnosis was 16.67% (1/6). Kappa analysis of the consistency between dual-source CT and arthroscopy showed a Kappa value of 0.719, indicating a high degree of consistency between the two examinations. In conclusion, MPR and VRT images are of clinical value for the diagnosis of ACL injury. In addition, dual-source CT can measure the CT value of the ACL and the thickness of each segment by MPR and VRT postprocessing techniques to diagnose the ligament injury in an objective, quantitative, and noninvasive way and can use dual-energy staining techniques to predict the ligament injury in a more intuitive way, which is not available in some arthroscopes. ? 2021 Cheng Ji et al.",Scopus,10.1155/2021/6667046,Journal of Healthcare Engineering
1185,SC-568,Michalak et al. (2021),2021,Plateletcrit and Mean Platelet Volume in the Evaluation of Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Patients,"Platelet (PLT) indices have been proposed as potential markers in the assessment of liver fibrosis and exacerbation of liver failure. The aim of our study was to verify mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT) in alcohol-related liver cirrhosis (ALC) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. One hundred forty-two patients with ALC, 92 with NAFLD, and 68 in control group were enrolled in this study. Hematological indices (MPV, PCT, and PDW) and serological (indirect and direct) markers of liver fibrosis (AAR, APRI, FIB-4, GPR, PICP, PIIINP, TGF-, PDGF-AB, laminin) were measured in each participant. MELD score in ALC patients and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) together with BARD score in the NAFLD group were also obtained. Results were compared between research and control groups. Then, a correlation between evaluated indices was performed in study groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) and area under the curve (AUC) values were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of measured indices. Significant increase in PDW and decrease in PCT in comparison to controls were noted in examined ALC (60.4% vs. 51.2% and 0.1% vs. 0.21%, respectively, p<0.0001) and NAFLD (54.75% vs. 51.2% and 0.19 vs. 0.21%, respectively, p<0.01) patients. Decreased level of MPV was observed in NAFLD group (7.85 fl vs. 8.90 fl, p<0.0001). Additionally, PCT correlated with NFS (p<0.0001). Evaluated PLT indices correlated with MELD score (MPV and PDW, p<0.001; PCT, p<0.05). They correlated with indirect and direct markers of liver fibrosis in the whole research group, too. PCT was the parameter with the greatest diagnostic accuracy in ALC patients (AUC=0,839 for cutoff<0.17%); in NAFLD group, it was MPV (AUC=0,808 for cutoff<7.9 fl). PCT in ALC and MPV in NAFLD can be perceived as potential diagnostic markers. ? 2021 Agata Michalak et al.",Scopus,10.1155/2021/8867985,BioMed Research International
1186,SC-569,Zou et al. (2021),2021,"Endoscopically Assisted, Minimally Invasive Reconstruction for Chronic Achilles Tendon Rupture With a Double-Bundle Flexor Hallucis Longus","Background: High morbidity has been reported regarding Achilles tendon (AT) injuries, and the upward trend has accelerated since the mid-1990s. A chronic Achilles tendon rupture usually results from a neglected or misdiagnosed acute rupture, and about one-fifth of acute AT ruptures are missed and lead to chronic AT rupture. Although many techniques have been described, there is no gold standard in the treatment of chronic AT ruptures. Hypothesis: Endoscopically assisted, minimally invasive reconstruction for chronic AT rupture using a double-bundle flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon would result in improvement of the overall function, with a low rate of wound complications. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between May 2015 and November 2016, a total of 19 consecutive patients were enrolled and treated using endoscopically assisted, minimally invasive reconstruction for chronic AT rupture using a double-bundle FHL. The operative assessment comprised the Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score, the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score, the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment?Achilles score, and a postoperative questionnaire. All postoperative complications were recorded. Results: The mean follow-up time for all patients was 31 months (range, 20-42 months). According to the postoperative questionnaire, the result of surgery was excellent in 8 (42%) of 19 patients, good in 10 (53%), and fair in 1 (5%). All clinical outcome scores (mean ñ SD) improved significantly after surgery: Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score, 23.3 ñ 10.3 vs 98.3 ñ 9.2 (postoperatively vs preoperatively); American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society, 52.1 ñ 12.4 vs 97.5 ñ 18.9; and Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment?Achilles, 23.4 ñ 11.2 vs 95.7 ñ 17.1 (P <.05). No complications with regard to wound healing or infection were noted. Twelve relatively young patients returned to preinjury activity levels, such as playing basketball or badminton, and the older patients were able to meet their daily needs, such as walking up stairs and jogging. Conclusion: Chronic AT ruptures were successfully treated via minimally invasive reconstruction using a double-bundle FHL, which provided excellent functional improvement. It is best suited for patients with complex requirements who are at high risk for wound complications. ? The Author(s) 2021.",Scopus,10.1177/2325967120979990,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine
1187,SC-570,Ertilav et al. (2021),2021,Relation of peroneus longus autograft dimensions with anthropometric parameters in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Importance of the distal leg diameter,"Objectives: This study aims to investigate the relationship between various anthropometric parameters and the diameter and length of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Patients and methods: A total of 52 patients (38 males, 14 females; mean age: 29.2ñ7.7 years; range, 17 to 51 years) who received PLT autograft for ACL reconstruction in our center between July 2018 and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics of the patients and leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters were recorded before the operation. The PLT autograft diameter and length were measured during surgery. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found between the graft diameter and length and weight, height, body mass index (BMI), leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters (p<0.01). There was no statistically significant correlation between the graft diameter and length and age (p>0.05). Distal leg diameter had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft diameter (r=0.956), while the height had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft length (r=0.982). Conclusion: Anthropometric parameters of height, weight, BMI, leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters may be helpful for surgeons to predict the diameter and length of the PLT autograft before surgery. Distal leg diameter is a particularly important parameter in predicting PLT autograft diameter. ? 2021 All right reserved by the Turkish Joint Diseases Foundation",Scopus,10.5606/ehc.2021.79580,Joint Diseases and Related Surgery

Patients & methods: Ten patients who underwent allograft lateral tenodesis were compared with 15 patients who underwent lateral tenodesis using a split peroneus brevis tendon. Patients were followed up after an average time of 10.5 years. Results: No statistically significant differences concerning American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society and Karlsson-Peterson scores were reported (p = n.s.). A reduced average radiographic anterior talar translation was observed in the autograft group compared with the allograft group (1.4 and 4.0 mm respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Both surgical techniques significantly improved subjective and objective outcomes in patients suffering from chronic ankle instability compared with pre-operatory status. Autograft stabilization provided reduced post-operative anterior talar translation compared with allograft tenodesis. ? 2021 Future Medicine Ltd.",Scopus,10.2217/cer-2020-0070,Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research
1189,SC-572,Burland et al. (2021),2021,Examining the relationship between neuroplasticity and learned helplessness after ACLR: Early versus late recovery,"Context: Altered neural signaling is known to have a direct impact on psychological wellness. Therefore, disruptions in neural signaling after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may influence psychological dysfunction, in some cases manifesting as learned helplessness. Helplessness is a psychological paradigm that presents as altered neuromuscular control, reduced motivation, and psychological deficits. Objectives: The authors sought to evaluate the relationship between helplessness, neural activity, and quadriceps function at different time points after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Evidence Acquisition: Twenty-nine individuals with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were categorized into early group (<2 y, age: 19.13 [2.18] y; height: 1.77 [0.11] m; mass: 76.903 [11.87] kg) or late group (>2 y, age: 22 [23] y; height: 1.67 [0.07] m; mass: 65.66 [11.33] kg). Quadriceps function (activation and strength), spinal-reflexive and corticospinal excitability (active motor thresholds and motor evoked potentials), and helplessness were obtained. A principal component analysis was performed by group (early and late) to identify which factors of helplessness were most associated with neural activity and quadriceps function. Pearson product moment correlation analyses were performed by group to determine associations between individual components and main outcomes. Evidence Synthesis: In the early group, cognitive readiness was associated with quadriceps strength of the injured limb (r2 = .513, P = .004), and self-awareness/management was associated with motor threshold of the injured limb (r2 = .238, P = .05). In the late group, intrinsic helplessness was associated with motor output of injured limb (r2 = .653, P = .01). Conclusion: Helplessness is made up of several attributional constructs, which are altered at different phases of recovery. Helplessness constructs interact differently with neural activity and quadriceps function across time. These findings are preliminary and do not establish a causal link between neural alterations and learned helplessness. Future studies should serially evaluate both changes in neural activity and learned helplessness attributes throughout recovery. ? 2021 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2019-0379,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation
1190,SC-573,Rodrigues et al. (2021),2021,Proximal and distal muscle thickness is different in women with patellofemoral pain but is not associated with knee frontal plane projection angle,"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare proximal and distal muscle thickness between patellofemoral pain (PFP) and asymptomatic women (CG) and to verify the possible association between morphology and lower limb alignment during single leg-squat. Methods: Thirty women (PFP, n = 15 and CG, n = 15) performed the following evaluations: (i) muscle thickness of external oblique (EO), gluteus medius (GMed), tensor fascia latae (TFL), peroneus (PER) and tibialis anterior (TA); (ii) knee frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) during single-leg squat. Results: Compared with the CG, PFP showed: (1) smaller GMed (?10.02%; p = 0.04; effect size = 0.82), greater TFL (+18.44%; p = 0.02; effect size = 0.92) and PER (+14.23%; p = 0.02; effect size = 0.87) muscle thickness and greater knee FPPA during single-leg squat (+31.8%; p = 0.04; effect size = 1.12). No differences were observed in EO (+7.17%; p = 0.37; effect size = 0.34) and TA (?1.35%; p = 0.81; effect size = 0.12) muscle thickness. Additionally, we failed to observe significant associations between muscle morphology and knee FPPA in both groups. Conclusion: PFP patients showed alterations in proximal and distal muscle thickness, despite the lack of association with poor lower limb alignment. Prospective studies are necessary to determine if differences in muscle morphology are the cause or the consequence of PFP and to confirm the absence of relationship with lower limb alignment. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbmt.2020.10.010,Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies

Methods: This quasi-experimental university-laboratory study included 50 adult volunteers?25 with CAI (16 female, 9 male; age: 26 ñ 9.42 years; height: 173.12 ñ 9.85 cm; weight: 79.27 ñ 18 kg) and 25 healthy controls (15 female, 10 male; age: 25.8 ñ 5.45 years; height: 169.47 ñ 9.43 cm; weight: 68.47 ñ 13 kg). Participants completed the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), single-leg balance, and assessment of spinal reflex excitability before and after a single treatment of dry needling to the fibularis longus. The anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial directions of the SEBT were randomized, and reach distances were normalized to a percentage of leg length. A composite SEBT score was calculated by averaging the normalized scores. Postural control was assessed in single-limb stance on a force plate through time-to-boundary measurements in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Fibularis longus and soleus spinal reflexes were obtained by providing electrical stimulation to the common fibular and tibial nerves with participants lying prone. A Group ? Time analysis examined changes in performance, and effect sizes were calculated to assess significance. Results: Significant group ? time interactions were identified for composite (P = .006) and posteromedial (P = .017) SEBT scores. Significant time effects for all directions of the SEBT, time to boundary with eyes open, and the mediolateral direction with eyes closed indicate improved postural control following treatment (P < .008). Within-group effect sizes for significant time effects ranged from small to large, indicating potential clinical utility. Conclusion: Dry needling demonstrated immediate short-term improvement in measures of static and postural control in individuals with CAI as well as healthy controls. ? 2020",Scopus,10.1016/j.jmpt.2020.08.001,Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics
1192,SC-575,Olewnik et al. (2021),2021,Quadriceps or multiceps femoris??Cadaveric study,"Purpose: The quadriceps femoris (QF) consists of four muscles: the rectus femoris; vastus medialis; vastus lateralis, and vastus intermediate. The tendons of all of these parts join together into a single tendon that attaches to the patella. The QF is a powerful extensor of the knee joint that is needed for walking. A growing number of publications have examined the fifth head of the QF muscle. There is no information about the possibility of other heads, and there is no correct classification of their proximal attachments. Further, the frequency of occurrence of additional heads/components of the QF remains unclear. Methods: One hundred and six lower limbs (34 male and 18 female) fixed in 10% formalin solution were examined. Results: Additional heads of the QF were present in 64.1% of the limbs. Three main types were identified and included subtypes. The most common was Type I (44.1%), which had an independent fifth head. This type was divided into two subtypes (A-B) depending on its location relative to the vastus intermediate. The second most common type was Type II (30.8%), which originated from other muscles: IIA from the vastus lateralis; IIB from the vastus intermediate, and IIC from the gluteus minimus. In addition, Type III (25%) was characterized by multiple heads: IIIA?two heads with a single common tendon; IIIB?two heads with two separate tendons; IIIC?three heads (lateral, intermediate, medial), and IIID?four heads (bifurcated lateral and bifurcated medial). Conclusion: The introduction of a new classification based on a proximal attachment is necessary. The presence of the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth head varies. ? 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Scopus,10.1002/ca.23646,Clinical Anatomy

(2020),2020,Postural stability and muscle activation onset during double-to single-leg stance transition in flat-footed individuals,"The effects of foot posture on postural stability and on muscular activation pattern for postural control remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate postural stability and muscular activation onset during the transition task from double-to single-leg stance in individuals with different foot postures. Twenty-seven healthy men (age: 21.5 ñ 1.5 years) were divided into 3 groups using the Foot Posture Index: neutral foot (n = 10); flatfoot (n = 8); and high-arched foot (n = 9). Center of pressure (COP) data and muscle activation onset times of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and soleus during the transition task with eyes closed were compared among groups using one-way analysis of variance and a post-hoc Tukey honestly significant difference test (p < 0.05) when the data were normally distributed and the Kruskal-Wallis test and a post-hoc Mann-Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction (p < 0.0167) when the data were not normally distributed. The COP displacements in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions and the resultant COP displacement during the first 3 s after a stability time point, as determined by sequential estimation during the single-leg stance phase, differed significantly among the three groups (p < 0.05). Post-hoc tests showed that the displacements were significantly greater in the flatfoot group than in the neutral and high-arched foot groups (p < 0.05), and the effect sizes for these results were large. No muscular activation onset times showed significant intergroup differ-ences. Postural stability was significantly decreased only in the flatfoot group, while muscle activation onsets did not differ significantly by foot posture during the transition task. Decreased postural stability may be one mechanism underlying the link between flatfoot and risk of lower limb injury, and foot posture rep-resents a potential confounder for measuring postural stability during the transition task. ?

The aim of this study was to compare the strength and reaction time of the quadriceps, hamstring, and GCM muscles and foot pressure between patients with PF and normal controls. Methods: A total of 21 PF patients and 21 normal controls were enrolled. Muscle strength was measured by the peak torque per body weight (Nmkg? 1 ? 100). Muscle reaction time was evaluated by the acceleration time (AT, milliseconds). Foot pressure and posture were assessed by pedobarography [valgus/varus index (VV index), %]. Results: The strength of the quadriceps was significantly lower in the affected ankles of the PF group than in the control group (p =ÿ0.005). The AT of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles was significantly increased in the affected ankles of the PF group than in the control group (quadriceps: p =ÿ0.012, hamstring: p =ÿ0.001), while the AT of the GCM muscle was significantly decreased (p =ÿ0.009) and significantly correlated negatively with quadriceps muscle strength (r = ?.598, p = 0.004) and AT (r = ?.472, p = 0.031). Forefoot (p =ÿ0.001) and hindfoot (p =ÿ0.000) pressure were significantly greater, with the VV index showing hindfoot valgus, in the affected ankles in the PF group compared to the control group (p =ÿ0.039). Conclusions: This study demonstrated weakness and delayed reaction time of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, with a rapid reaction time of the GCM muscle, in patients with PF. Clinical relevance: Clinicians and therapists should assess the function of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles when planning the management of PF patients without muscle tightness. ? 2020, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s12891-020-03740-1,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
1196,SC-579,Wang et al. (2020),2020,An Autograft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Results in Better Biomechanical Performance and Tendon-Bone Incorporation Than Does a Hybrid Graft in a Rat Model,"Background: The biomechanical and tendon-bone incorporation properties of allograft-augmented hybrid grafts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction compared with traditional autografts are unknown. Hypothesis: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction yields better results on biomechanical testing, radiographic analysis, and histological evaluation versus using a hybrid graft. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 66 adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with an autograft (AT group; n = 33) or a hybrid graft (HB group; n = 33). The grafts used in both groups were harvested from the peroneus longus tendon and were fixed by suturing to the surrounding periosteum. Samples were harvested for biomechanical testing, micro?computed tomography (CT), and histological evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Bone tunnels on the femoral and tibial sides were divided into 3 subregions: intra-articular (IA), midtunnel (MT), and extra-articular (EA). A cylinder-like volume of interest in the bone tunnel and a tubular-like volume of interest around the bone tunnel were used to evaluate new bone formation and bone remodeling, respectively, via micro-CT. Results: In the AT group, there were significantly higher failure loads and stiffness at 8 weeks (failure load: 3.04 ñ 0.40 vs 2.09 ñ 0.54 N, respectively; P =.006) (stiffness: 3.43 ñ 0.56 vs 1.75 ñ 0.52 N/mm, respectively; P <.001) and 12 weeks (failure load: 9.10 ñ 1.13 vs 7.14 ñ 0.94 N, respectively; P =.008) (stiffness: 4.45 ñ 0.75 vs 3.36 ñ 0.29 N/mm, respectively; P =.008) than in the HB group. With regard to new bone formation in the bone tunnel, in the AT group, the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher than in the HB group on the tibial side at 8 weeks (IA: 22.21 ñ 4.98 vs 5.16 ñ 3.98, respectively; P <.001) (EA: 19.66 ñ 7.19 vs 10.85 ñ 2.16, respectively; P =.030) and 12 weeks (IA: 30.50 ñ 5.04 vs 17.11 ñ 7.31, respectively; P =.010) (MT: 21.15 ñ 2.58 vs 15.55 ñ 4.48, respectively; P =.041) (EA: 20.75 ñ 3.87 vs 10.64 ñ 3.94, respectively; P =.003). With regard to bone remodeling around the tunnel, the BV/TV was also significantly higher on the tibial side at 8 weeks (MT: 33.17 ñ 8.05 vs 15.21 ñ 7.60, respectively; P =.007) (EA: 25.19 ñ 6.38 vs 13.94 ñ 7.10, respectively; P =.030) and 12 weeks (IA: 69.46 ñ 4.45 vs 47.80 ñ 6.16, respectively; P <.001) (MT: 33.15 ñ 3.88 vs 13.76 ñ 4.07, respectively; P <.001) in the AT group than in the HB group. Sharpey-like fibers had formed at 8 weeks in the AT group. A large number of fibroblasts withdrew at 12 weeks. In the AT group, the width of the interface was significantly narrower at 4 weeks (85.86 ñ 17.49 vs 182.97 ñ 14.35 ?m, respectively; P <.001), 8 weeks (58.86 ñ 10.99 vs 90.15 ñ 11.53 ?m, respectively; P =.002), and 12 weeks (42.70 ñ 7.96 vs 67.29 ñ 6.55 ?m, respectively; P =.001) than in the HB group. Conclusion: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction may result in improved biomechanical properties and tendon-bone incorporation compared with a hybrid graft. Clinical Relevance: Augmenting small autografts with allograft tissue may result in decreased biomechanical performance and worse tendon-bone incorporation, increasing the risk of graft failure. ? 2020 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546520967668,American Journal of Sports Medicine

Muscle fatigue may contribute to the delayed muscle reaction and subsequent injury. This study investigated the ankle muscle reaction time during a simulated, prolonged football protocol. Methods: Seven amateur female football players participated in a 105-min simulated, prolonged football protocol. An ankle muscle reaction test was conducted with a pair of ankle sprain simulators at a scheduled interval every 15-min. The reaction times of peroneus longus, tibialis anterior, and lateral gastrocnemius were collected using an electromyography system sampling at 1000 Hz. Repeated measures one-way multivariate analysis of variance with post-hoc paired t-tests were conducted to evaluate if the reaction time at each time point significantly differed from baseline. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 level. Results: Reaction times started from 40.5?47.7 ms at baseline and increased to 48.6?55.7 ms at the end. Reaction times significantly increased in all muscles after the first 15 min except for the dominant lateral gastrocnemius. Increased reaction times were seen in the non-dominant limb after 60 min for tibialis anterior, after 75 min for peroneus longus, and after 90 min for the lateral gastrocnemius. Conclusions: Delayed reaction time of the ankle muscles were found after the first 15 min and in the final 45 min of a simulated prolonged football protocol. Strategies for injury prevention should also focus on tackling the delayed ankle muscle reaction time in the acute phase (the first 15 min), in addition to the latter minutes in the second half.

1198,SC-581,Pineo et al. (2020),2020,Integrating health into the complex urban planning policy and decision-making context: a systems thinking analysis,"Public health practitioners produce urban health indicator (UHI) tools to inform built environment policy and decision-making, among other objectives. Indicator producers perceive UHI tools as an easily understandable form of evidence about the urban environment impact on health for policy-makers? consumption. However, indicator producers often conceptualise policy-making as a rational and linear process, therefore underestimating the complex and contested nature of developing and implementing policy. This study investigates the health-promotion value of UHI tools in the complex urban planning policy and decision-making context. A thematic analysis was conducted following semi-structured interviews with 22 indicator producers and users in San Francisco, Melbourne and Sydney. The analysis was informed by collaborative rationality and systems theories and the results were used to develop causal loop diagrams (CLDs) of producers and users? mental models. The preliminary CLDs were tested and improved through a participatory modelling workshop (six participants). A high-level CLD depicts users and producers? shared mental model in which indicator development and use are embedded in policy development and application processes. In the cases analysed, creating and using UHI tools increased inter-sectoral relationships, which supported actors to better understand each other?s opportunities and constraints. These relationships spurred new advocates for health in diverse organisations, supporting health-in-all-policies and whole-of-society approaches. Constraints to health-promoting policy and implementation (such as those which are legal, political and economic in nature), were overcome through community involvement in UHI tools and advocacy effectiveness. A number of factors reduced the perceived relevance and authority of UHI tools, including: a high number of available indicators, lack of neighbourhood scale data and poor-quality data. In summary, UHI tools were a form of evidence that influenced local urban planning policy and decision-making when they were embedded in policy processes, networks and institutions. In contrast to the dominant policy impact model in the indicator literature, such evidence did not typically influence policy as an exogenous entity. Indicators had impact when they were embedded in local institutions and well-resourced over time, resulting in trusted relationships and collaborations among indicator producers and users. Further research is needed to explore other governance contexts and how UHI tools affect the power of different actors, particularly for under-represented communities. ? 2020, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1057/s41599-020-0398-3,Palgrave Communications

Among the available methods to predict PLT measurements, anthropometric parameters are one of the most accessible and feasible methods. The objective of this prospective study was to predict the PLT autograft sizes in single bundle ACL reconstruction by using preoperative anthropometric measurement. Method: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), shank circumference and shank length of 20 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter and length of the PLT autograft obtained. Result: Pearson correlation test has shown that body weight and height correlates to PLT length and diameter also autograft's length and diameter significantly (p < 0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that height, weight, TLL and shank length were signifcantly related to autograft diameter. While height and TLL were significantly related to autograft length. Conclusion: Height, weight, TLL and shank length can use to predict PLT autograft diameter. While height and TLL can use to predict PLT autograft length. ? 2020 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.jor.2020.03.011,Journal of Orthopaedics

The EHL is characterized by a number of morphological variations, concerning mainly the accessory bands and their insertion. The aim of our research was to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound in determining the anatomical variations of the EHL. Methods: The morphology of the EHL was evaluated by ultrasound (high-frequency linear probe of Samsung RS80 apparatus) in 50 healthy volunteers. The types of EHL morphology were determined according to a threefold classification. Results: Only two types of the threefold anatomical classification were observed: Type I in 76 limbs (76%) and Type IIa in 24 limbs (24%). The accessory bands of the EHL were found in 24% of cases, all of which demonstrated a course that was located medially in relation to the main tendon. Conclusion: Ultrasound allows for visualization of the EHL; however, the potential recognition of morphological variance is limited. Level of Evidence: I ?

1201,SC-584,Richie et al. (2020),2020,Pathomechanics of common foot disorders,"This new book consolidates the current knowledge of lower extremity biomechanics and pathomechanics and makes this information relevant to the study of common foot and ankle pathologies. The content is presented in a language and format that allows the clinician to review current evidence explaining the etiology of these disorders in order to formulate effective treatment interventions. In order to understand pathomechanics, the clinician must also become versed in the normal, healthy biomechanics of the lower extremity. A review of gait, muscle function and forces acting on the lower extremities during physical activity will be the focus of the first part of this book. The second part of the book will study the common, challenging pathologies treated on a daily basis by foot and ankle clinicians: hallux abducto valgus, hallux rigidus, metatarsalgia, digital deformities, adult acquired flatfoot, and plantar heel pain. These chapters discuss all the relevant factors contributing to these conditions, evaluating and exposing myths and misconceptions about the pathomechanics and treatments of these conditions. For each disorder, a comprehensive review of published research provides a foundation for an updated, valid description of etiology and risk factors. Providing a fresh approach to lower extremity pathomechanics and management strategies, Pathomechanics of Common Foot Disorders is a valuable resource for podiatrists and orthopedic foot and ankle surgeons at all levels. ?

(2020),2020,Airborne radiometric validation of the geostationary lightning mapper using the Fly's Eye GLM Simulator,"The Fly's Eye GLM Simulator (FEGS) is a multi-spectral array of radiometers designed to provide a validation dataset for the geostationary lightning mapper (GLM). The main component of FEGS is a 5 ? 5 grid of radiometers, each with a square 18 deg field of view, that are sensitive to a 10-nm wide spectral band centered on 780 nm to observe a neutral atomic oxygen emission triplet at 777.4 nm. FEGS was flown as a primary payload on the high-altitude NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the GOES-R validation flight campaign in the spring of 2017. More than 14,000 lightning flashes were recorded over a variety of thunderstorm phenomenologies and geographical regions in the continental United States and Atlantic Ocean. Following the application of a quality control process, a subset of 9160 of these flashes occurring during daylight hours was suitable for analysis. This analysis has provided an independent, lower bound estimate of the average daytime optical flash detection efficiency (FDE) of GLM at 64%. The FDE varied significantly between storms and location ranging between 44% and 88%. An upper estimate of the time-integrated cloud-top radiance detection threshold of GLM during daytime observations is calculated to be 9 ?J / m2 sr nm. Dependencies of GLM performance on the temporal width, energy, and cloud-top area of optical pulses, and the background solar radiance conditions are presented and discussed. ? The Authors.

1203,SC-586,Armitano-Lago et al. (2020),2020,Biofeedback augmenting lower limb loading alters the underlying temporal structure of gait following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Biofeedback has recently been explored to target deviant lower extremity loading mechanics following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to mitigate the development of post traumatic osteoarthritis. The impact this feedback has on the structure of the stride interval dynamics?a barometer of gait system health?however, have yet to be examined. This study was designed to assess how feedback, used to alter lower-extremity loading during gait, affects the structure of stride interval variability by examining long-range stride-to-stride correlations during gait in those with unilateral ACLR. Twelve participants walked under three separate loading conditions: (1) control (i.e., no cue) (2) high loading, and (3) low loading. Baseline vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) data was used to calculate a target 5% change in vGRF for the appropriate loading condition (i.e., high loading was +5% vGRF, low loading was ?5% vGRF). The target for the load condition was displayed on a screen along with real-time vGRF values, prescribing changes in stride-to-stride peak vertical ground reaction forces of each limb. From time-series of stride intervals (i.e., duration), we analyzed the mean and standard deviation of stride-to-stride variability and, via detrended fluctuation analysis (i.e., DFA à), temporal persistence for each feedback condition. Both the high and low loading conditions exhibited a change toward more temporally persistent stride intervals (high loading: à =0.92, low loading: à = 0.98) than walking under the control condition (à = 0.78; high vs. control: p = .026, low vs. control: p = .001). Overall, these results indicate that altering lower extremity load changes the temporal persistence of the stride internal dynamics in ACLR individuals, demonstrating the implications of the design of gait training interventions and the influence feedback has on movement strategies. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.humov.2020.102685,Human Movement Science

1205,SC-588,Sawamura et al. (2020),2020,Effect of fascial Manipulation? on reaction time,"Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the effects of fascial manipulation (FM) on muscle force and electrical activity. Methods: Sixty healthy adult participants were randomly assigned to the FM intervention group (FM group; n = 20), static stretching intervention group (SS group; n = 20), and control group (C group; n = 20). The FM group underwent FM for the right brachial fascia (antecubitus) for 210 s. The SS group underwent static stretching of the right biceps brachii for 210 s. The C group was supine for 210 s. Participants were asked to flex the right elbow joint as quickly as possible after a light signal appeared during three sessions (before, immediately after, and 1 week after the intervention). During each session, the muscle activity of the right biceps brachii and bending force of the right elbow joint were measured. We calculated the reaction time (RT), pre-motor time (PMT), motor time (MT), time to peak force (TPF), and time to peak activity (TPA) from these measurements. Results: The RT, MT, TPA, and TPF of the FM group were significantly shorter immediately after or 1 week after the intervention compared with those before the intervention. The RT, MT, TPA, and TPF of the FM group were significantly shorter than those of the SS group or C group immediately after or 1 week after the intervention. Conclusion: FM improved RT, MT, TPA, and TPA, and the effects lasted for 1 week. Both mechanical and neurological factors may contribute to improvements in motor performance after FM. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbmt.2020.06.003,Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies
1206,SC-589,Zhang et al. (2020),2020,Novel Double Endobutton Technique Combined with Three-Dimensional Printing: A Biomechanical Study of Reconstruction in Acromioclavicular Joint Dislocation,"Objective: To reconstruct the acromioclavicular (AC) joint using an adjusted closed-loop double Endobutton technique via a guiding locator that was applied using three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. At the same time, the reliability and safety of the novel double Endobutton (NDE) were tested by comparing the biomechanics of this technique with the TightRope (TR) approach. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted between January 2017 and January 2019. The Department of Anatomy at Southern Medical University obtained 18 fresh-frozen specimens (8 left and 10 right; 12 men and 6 women). First, the guiding locators were applied using 3D printing technology. After preparation of materials, specimens were divided into an NDE group, a TR group, and a normal group. In the NDE and TR groups, the navigation module was used to locate and establish the bone tunnels; after that, the NDE or TR was implanted. However, the Endobuttons were fixed while pressing the distal clavicle downwards and the length of the loop could be adjusted by changing the upper Endobutton in the NDE group while the suture button construct was tensioned and knotted after pressing down the distal clavicle in the TR. Finally, load testing in anterior?posterior (AP), superior?inferior (SI), and medial?lateral (ML) directions as well as load-to-failure testing in the SI direction were undertaken to verify whether the NDE or TR had better biomechanics. Results: In the load testing, the displacements of the NDE and TR groups in the AP, SI, and ML direction were significantly shorter than those of the normal group (P < 0.05). In the load-to-failure testing, the ultimate load of the NDE and TR groups had significantly higher increases than the normal group (722.16 ñ 92.04 vs 564.63 ñ 63.05, P < 0.05; 680.20 ñ 110.29 vs 564.63 ñ 63.05, P < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two techniques for these two tests (P > 0.05). In the NDE group, four of six failures were a result of tunnel fractures of the coracoid, while two of six were due to suture breakage. In the TR, three failures were due to coracoid tunnel fractures, one was a result of a clavicle tunnel fracture, and the rest were due to suture breakage. In the normal group, half of the failures were a result of avulsion fractures of the conical ligament at the point of the coracoid process, and the other three were due to rupture of the conical ligament, fracture of the distal clavicle, and fracture of the scapular body. Conclusion: As for the TR technique, the stability and strength of the AC joint were better in patients who underwent reconstruction using the NDE technique than in the intact state. ? 2020 The Authors.

(2020),2020,Sex differences in neuromuscular control of quadriceps,"Purpose: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is twice as prevalent in females as males, yet a few studies have evaluated differences in quadriceps muscle control between sexes or across force levels. This study investigated sex differences in quadriceps EMG onset times and amplitude at different force levels during isometric knee extension in asymptomatic males and females and in females with PFPS. Methods: Thirteen healthy males, 12 healthy females, and 10 females with PFPS performed isometric knee extension ramp contractions at 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Surface EMG was recorded from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis oblique (VMO), vastus medialis (VM), and rectus femoris (RF). Results: Healthy females showed delayed VL (222 ñ 67ÿms, p = 0.002), VMO (357 ñ 101ÿms, p = 0.001), and VM (258 ñ 62ÿms, p < 0.001) recruitment in comparison with healthy males. Healthy males activated the VL earlier than the VM (156 ñ 51ÿms, p = 0.02) and RF (379 ñ 74ÿms, p < 0.001), and at a similar time as the VMO; healthy females activated the VL earlier than the VM (192 ñ 53ÿms, p = 0.004) and VMO (239 ñ 73ÿms, p = 0.01). A lower VMO:VL activation ratio was found at 25% MVC (p < 0.001) than at higher force levels. Conclusions: Delayed activation of the VMO relative to the VL has been proposed as a risk factor for PFPS. This study confirms a delay in VMO onset time in females. ? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s00421-020-04443-0,European Journal of Applied Physiology

(2020),2020,Observations of Anomalous Charge Structures in Supercell Thunderstorms in the Southeastern United States,"Anomalous thunderstorm charge structures (ACSs), characterized by a dominant layer of positive charge in the lower mixed-phase region, are uncommon and rarely reported outside of the Great Plains region of the United States. This study documents the kinematics, precipitation microphysics, and charge structures of two supercell thunderstorms exhibiting ACSs that were observed in the Southeastern United States. Ground-based three-dimensional total lightning observations, polarimetric Doppler radar observations, and environmental model analysis of these supercells presented the opportunity to evaluate conceptual models of ACS development and characteristics in an atypical parameter space. In both anomalous storms, prominent layers of positive charge were located in lower to middle mixed-phase regions (?10øC to ?30øC) of updrafts and were spatially associated with riming hydrometeor types. Simultaneously, negative charge regions were identified above the primary positive charge layers in the upper mixed-phase and glaciated region of updrafts, collocated with graupel and small ice hydrometeors. While coarse charge structure observations were consistent with noninductive charging-based models of anomalous storms, charge structure complexities were also observed that suggested variability in cloud microphysical conditions. Analysis of the environments in which these storms formed indicated that several parameters thought to increase mixed-phase liquid water content in favor of anomalous charging were inconsistent with those documented in the Great Plains region. However, environmental humidity metrics were most comparable. Comparisons between these and other documented anomalous storms identified similarities in kinematic structure and microphysical conditions while motivating ongoing study of the environmental parameter space supportive of ACSs. ? 2020.

(2020),2020,Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft to Reconstruct the Posterolateral Corner of the Knee; Enxerto do tend?o fibular longo na reconstru‡?o do canto posterolateral do joelho,"The posterolateral corner is critical to knee stability. Neglected injuries have a direct impact on the prognosis due to residual instability, chronic pain, deformities, and failure to repair other structures. Several techniques are used to reconstruct the posterolateral corner, often with autologous ischiotibial grafts or homologous grafts. An option little used for knee ligament reconstructions is the peroneus longus tendon graft. Although reported as a good alternative for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, we found no case using a peroneus longus tendon graft for posterolateral corner reconstruction. Here, we describe the case of a patient who underwent a nonanatomical reconstruction of the posterolateral corner using a peroneus longus tendon graft. The patient underwent surgical procedures for ligament reconstruction and correction of the deformity caused by a failed graft, but his knee remained unstable. During the preoperative planning, it was decided to reconstruct the posterolateral corner with an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft. Studies have shown that the peroneus longus tendon graft does not increase ankle morbidity, and that its length and diameter favor ligament reconstruction. Thus, the present article highlights the importance of the proper diagnosis of ligament injuries in the acute phase, and describes a new technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction that must be included in the surgeon's body of knowledge, increasing the amount of technical options. ? 2021.

1210,SC-593,Campanini et al. (2020),2020,Surface EMG in Clinical Assessment and Neurorehabilitation: Barriers Limiting Its Use,"This article addresses the potential clinical value of techniques based on surface electromyography (sEMG) in rehabilitation medicine with specific focus on neurorehabilitation. Applications in exercise and sport pathophysiology, in movement analysis, in ergonomics and occupational medicine, and in a number of related fields are also considered. The contrast between the extensive scientific literature in these fields and the limited clinical applications is discussed. The ?barriers? between research findings and their application are very broad, and are longstanding, cultural, educational, and technical. Cultural barriers relate to the general acceptance and use of the concept of objective measurement in a clinical setting and its role in promoting Evidence Based Medicine. Wide differences between countries exist in appropriate training in the use of such quantitative measurements in general, and in electrical measurements in particular. These differences are manifest in training programs, in degrees granted, and in academic/research career opportunities. Educational barriers are related to the background in mathematics and physics for rehabilitation clinicians, leading to insufficient basic concepts of signal interpretation, as well as to the lack of a common language with rehabilitation engineers. Technical barriers are being overcome progressively, but progress is still impacted by the lack of user-friendly equipment, insufficient market demand, gadget-like devices, relatively high equipment price and a pervasive lack of interest by manufacturers. Despite the recommendations provided by the 20-year old EU project on ?Surface EMG for Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM),? real international standards are still missing and there is minimal international pressure for developing and applying such standards. The need for change in training and teaching is increasingly felt in the academic world, but is much less perceived in the health delivery system and clinical environments. The rapid technological progress in the fields of sensor and measurement technology (including sEMG), assistive devices, and robotic rehabilitation, has not been driven by clinical demands. Our assertion is that the most important and urgent interventions concern enhanced education, more effective technology transfer, and increased academic opportunities for physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and kinesiologists. ?

1211,SC-594,Rodriguez et al. (2020),2020,"A tissue engineering approach for repairing craniofacial volumetric muscle loss in a sheep following a 2, 4, and 6-month recovery","Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is the loss of skeletal muscle that results in significant and persistent impairment of function. The unique characteristics of craniofacial muscle compared trunk and limb skeletal muscle, including differences in gene expression, satellite cell phenotype, and regenerative capacity, suggest that VML injuries may affect craniofacial muscle more severely. However, despite these notable differences, there are currently no animal models of craniofacial VML. In a previous sheep hindlimb VML study, we showed that our lab?s tissue engineered skeletal muscle units (SMUs) were able to restore muscle force production to a level that was statistically indistinguishable from the uninjured contralateral muscle. Thus, the goals of this study were to: 1) develop a model of craniofacial VML in a large animal model and 2) to evaluate the efficacy of our SMUs in repairing a 30% VML in the ovine zygomaticus major muscle. Overall, there was no significant difference in functional recovery between the SMU-treated group and the unrepaired control. Despite the use of the same injury and repair model used in our previous study, results showed differences in pathophysiology between craniofacial and hindlimb VML. Specifically, the craniofacial model was affected by concomitant denervation and ischemia injuries that were not exhibited in the hindlimb model. While clinically realistic, the additional ischemia and denervation likely created an injury that was too severe for our SMUs to repair. This study highlights the importance of balancing the use of a clinically realistic model while also maintaining control over variables related to the severity of the injury. These variables include the volume of muscle removed, the location of the VML injury, and the geometry of the injury, as these affect both the muscle?s ability to self-regenerate as well as the probability of success of the treatment. ? 2020 Rodriguez et al.

Design: Case control study design. Setting: Data were collected at the human movement analysis laboratory. Participants: 30 collegiate athletes with chronic ankle sprain (11 females and 19 males, 23.91 ñ 2.58 years). Main outcome measure: Hip, knee and ankle joints ranges of motion (ROMs); postural sway area and velocities in both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions; and muscular activity amplitudes (% peak) of lateral and medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus in a 20s single leg balance test in two non-taped (control) and KT (intervention) conditions. Results: Significant decrease observed in ankle lateral ROM (p = 0.048, d = 0.52), mediolateral postural sway velocity (p = 0.029, d = 1.25), and peroneus longus activity amplitudes (p = 0.042, d = 0.55) after KT application. Conclusion: Acute application of KT among athletes with chronic ankle instability could provide lateral mechanical support to the ankle, potentially decreasing the velocity of frontal plane sway, and decreasing the magnitude of muscle activation. These data suggest that KT may be beneficial for improving static joint stability among individuals with chronic ankle sprain, and thus could be considered an option to allow safe return-to-activity. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2020.06.007,Physical Therapy in Sport

(2020),2020,Evaluation of the effect of freezing and gamma irradiation on different types of tendon allografts by dic assisted tensile testing,"This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the endurance properties of four types of tendons caused by freezing and gamma irradiation. Four types of grafts were harvested: quadriceps, semitendinosus + gracilis, tibialis anterior, and peroneus longus. These were put into three groups: Group A was the control group, tested without freezing or irradiation. Grafts in Group B were frozen and irradiated (target dose: 21 kGy), while grafts in Group C were again frozen and irradiated (target dose: 42 kGy). Maximum load, tensile modulus, tensile strength, strain at maximum force and fracture strain were calculated from the force-elongation graphs of cyclic load tests. The higher gamma irradiation dose (Group C) significantly decreased the strains at tensile strength of the quadriceps tendons (p = 0.0004-0.0237), compared to the other two groups. In the case of the quadricep tendons (p = 0.0151), there is a significant decrease in Young's modulus after gamma irradiation with the dose of 42 kGy. According to the results of the study, the tibialis anterior and the peroneus longus are recommended in ACL reconstruction when gamma irradiation is required, while quadricep tendons, which are usually used for an autograph, are not suitable for allograft reconstruction after gamma irradiation from the viewpoint of mechanical properties. ? 2020 by the authors.",Scopus,10.3390/APP10155369,Applied Sciences (Switzerland)

(2020),2020,Efficacy of a semi automated commercial closed system for autologous leukocyte-and platelet-rich plasma (L-prp) production in dogs: A preliminary study,"Background: To characterize the cellular composition (platelets, erythrocytes, and leukocytes) and determine platelet-derived growth factor isoform BB (PDGF-BB) concentration in canine leukocyte-and platelet rich plasma (L-PRP) produced using a commercial semi-automated closed system. Methods: Twenty milliliters of citrated whole blood were obtained from 30 healthy un-sedated canine blood donors and processed using a semi-automated completely closed commercial system (CPUNT 20, Eltek group, Casale Monferrato, Alessandria, Italy) according to the manufacturer?s instructions. Erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet counts were determined in both whole blood (WB) and resultant L-PRP. The PDGF-BB concentration was evaluated after bovine thrombin activation of 10 L-PRP samples. Results: This commercial system produced on average 2.3 ñ 0.7 mL of L-PRP containing a high concentration of platelets (767,633 ñ 291,001 æL, p < 0.001), with a 4.4 fold increase in platelet count, lower concentration of erythrocytes (528,600 ñ 222,773 æL, p < 0.001) and similar concentration of leukocytes (8422 ñ 6346 æL, p = 0.9918) compared with WB. L-PRP had an average of 3442 ñ 2061 pg/mL of PDGF-BB after thrombin activation. Neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes average percent content in L-PRP was 14.8 ñ 13.2, 71.7 ñ 18.5 and 10.7 ñ 6.4, respectively. Conclusion: Sterile canine L-PRP prepared using this semi-automated closed system is easy to obtain, produces a significant increase in platelet count compared to WB and contains a detectable concentration of PDGF-BB after activation. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to assess inflammatory markers concentration and the therapeutic efficacy of this L-PRP in dogs. ? 2020 by the authors.

1217,SC-600,Tang et al. (2020),2020,Condyle-Pinching Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"The outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are still unsatisfactory. Anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction has been applied to augment ACL reconstruction, with better but still nonoptimal results. An anatomical analysis revealed that the route of ALL is quite different from that of ACL on the lateral view of the knee. Thus, we hope to augment ACL reconstruction with the reconstruction of an ACL-mimicking anterolateral structure, in which the route is similar to that of ACL. Thus, we aimed to introduce a combined ACL and ACL-mimicking anterolateral structure reconstruction technique, which we named condyle-pinching double-bundle ACL reconstruction. The main indication of this technique is ACL injury with a high degree of pivot shift or general laxity. The main steps of this technique include preparation of a combined graft, creation of a common femoral tunnel and 2 tibial tunnels, graft placement, and final graft fixation to an adjustable loop. We have been obtaining obvious outcome improvement clinically with this technique and consider that this report will provide special option in ACL reconstruction. ? 2020 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2020.04.009,Arthroscopy Techniques

(2020),2020,Lateral Meniscus Replacement Using Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"Nowadays, several techniques are available for preserving the lateral aspect of the knee after meniscectomy; meniscus transplantation is the gold standard, and meniscus scaffold implantation is an effective alternative. However, meniscus transplantation is technically difficult and has many potential complications, whereas scaffolds resorb over time. Autografts are commonly used for labroplasty in shoulder and hip surgeries. We attempted to adapt this technique to the knee, using autografts for meniscus replacement. In this report, we describe a meniscus-replacement technique, using a peroneus longus autograft, for lateral meniscus deficits. This technique significantly simplifies the procedure and is cost effective, and thus can be considered as an alternative technique for preventing osteoarthritis of the lateral aspect of the knee. ? 2020 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2020.04.016,Arthroscopy Techniques
1220,SC-603,Lee et al. (2020),2020,Tendon Regeneration After Partial-Thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Harvesting: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evaluation and In Vivo Animal Study,"Background: In recent years, the use of the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) as an autograft source for ligament reconstruction has gained popularity. However, no reports are available regarding tendon regeneration after harvesting of the AHPLT. Hypothesis: When half of the tendon is preserved during tendon harvesting, the quality of the regenerated tendon is better than that of the regenerated tendon after full-thickness harvesting. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4; controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 21 patients who underwent AHPLT harvesting for lower extremity ligament reconstruction participated in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study to evaluate tendon regeneration 1 year after the harvesting. An in vivo animal study was performed to compare the quality of the regenerated tendon after partial-thickness and full-thickness tendon harvesting. A total of 30 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to 2 groups?15 rats underwent partial-thickness Achilles tendon harvesting (partial-thickness harvesting [PTH] group), and 15 rats underwent full-thickness Achilles tendon harvesting (full-thickness harvesting [FTH] group). The quality of the regenerated tendons was compared 180 days after tendon harvesting. Results: All 21 patients showed regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) (homogeneously dark on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences). The cross-sectional area of the regenerated tendon divided by that of the preoperative tendon was 92.6% and 84.5% at 4 cm and 9 cm proximal to the tip of the distal fibula, respectively. In the animal study, the mean histologic score was better for the PTH group compared with the FTH group (9.17 ñ 1.35 vs 14.72 ñ 0.74; P <.001). The ultimate strength and the stiffness of the regenerated Achilles tendon were significantly higher for the PTH group compared with the FTH group (35.5 ñ 8.3 vs 22.4 ñ 8.3 N, P =.004; and 31.6 ñ 7.7 vs 23.5 ñ 4.8 N/mm, P =.016). Conclusion: The PLT was found to regenerate after partial-thickness harvesting on MRI. In the animal study, the quality of the regenerated tendon when half of the tendon was preserved during tendon harvesting was better than that after full-thickness tendon harvesting. ? 2020 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546520933628,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1221,SC-604,Armitano-Lago et al. (2020),2020,Anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed individuals demonstrate slower reactions during a dynamic postural task,"Introduction: To determine whether individuals with a history of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) exhibit altered neuromotor function compared to healthy controls. It was hypothesized that the ACLR group would have slower postural responses compared to healthy individuals of similar age. Materials and Methods: Sixteen adults with a unilateral ACLR and 16 matched healthy controls participated. General assessments of neuromotor function were gathered and included measures of reaction time (both seated and postural conditions), walking ability, balance, ankle ROM, proprioception, knee joint laxity, patellar tendon reflex latency, and quadriceps strength. Data were analyzed using mixed generalized linear models with between-subject (ie, controls, ACLR) and within-subject factors (ie, affected, unaffected limb). Results: Individuals with an ACLR exhibited a significant slowing of their postural reaction times compared to the control individuals. The ACLR group was slower under both the simple (ACLR: 484ÿñÿ6.17ÿms, control: 399ÿñÿ1.95ÿms) and choice reaction time conditions (ACLR: 550ÿñÿ43ÿms, control: 445ÿñÿ43ÿms). No other group differences were found in any of the other measures. Conclusion: Overall, ACLR individuals had a reduced ability to respond quickly under more challenging postural conditions (ie, stepping response). This finding would indicate that the impact of an ACLR is not purely mechanical and restricted to the joint. Rather, injury and reconstruction of the ACL impact neural mechanisms, altering individuals' ability to respond under challenging balance tasks. ? 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1222,SC-605,Albano et al. (2020),2020,Predictive role of ankle MRI for tendon graft choice and surgical reconstruction,"Purpose: Tendon transfers have become a common surgical procedure around the ankle. In this study, we sought to evaluate the existence of a correlation between specific anthropometric parameters and the size of some ankle tendons measured on MRI, in particular those mostly used as graft in ankle surgery. Methods: We recorded gender, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of 113 patients (57 females; mean age: 42 ñ 18) who underwent ankle MRI. MRI measurements performed by a radiologist were: axial shortest diameter of Achilles (AT), posterior tibialis (PTT), flexor digitorum longus (FDLT), flexor hallucis longus (FHLT), peroneus longus (PLT), and anterior tibialis (ATT) tendons, intermalleolar distance (ID) and talus width (TW). Mann?Whitney U test and Pearson?s correlation coefficient were used. After applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, statistical significance was set at p < 0.002. Results: The mean patient height, weight and BMI were 169 ñ 9.8ÿcm (range: 140?193), 72.4 ñ 16.4ÿkg (range: 44?142), and 25 ñ 5.7 (range: 16?50), respectively. The mean ankle measurements were: AT = 5.3 ñ 1.4ÿmm, PTT = 3.3 ñ 0.6ÿmm, FDLT = 2.6 ñ 0.4ÿmm, FHLT = 2.7 ñ 0.4ÿmm, PLT = 2.9 ñ 0.5ÿmm, ATT = 3ñ0.6ÿmm, ID = 62.9 ñ 4.5ÿmm, and TW = 28.8 ñ 2.5ÿmm. A statistical difference between male and female patients was observed regarding ID (z = ?6.955, p <.001), TW (z = ?6.692, p <.001), AT (z = ?3.587, p <.001), PTT (z = ?3.783, p <.001), and FDLT (z = ?3.744, p <.001). Both PTT and FDLT showed a significant correlation with ID (p <.001) and TW (p <.001). ATT size was significantly correlated with weight, ID and TW (all with p < 0.001). PLT and AT showed a significant correlation only with ID and weight (p ó.001), respectively. Conclusion: Our data might help orthopaedists in preoperative planning to identify the best graft for ankle surgical procedures including tendon transfers. ? 2020, Italian Society of Medical Radiology.",Scopus,10.1007/s11547-020-01177-z,Radiologia Medica
1223,SC-606,Balasukumaran et al. (2020),2020,Muscle activation patterns during backward walking in people with chronic ankle instability,"Background: Altered walking patterns are often described in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Contemporary treatment paradigms recommend backward walking (BW) to improve locomotion in people with musculoskeletal disorders. The purpose of this study was to determine whether muscle activity and activation variability during BW differs between subjects with and without CAI. Methods: Sixteen participants with CAI and 16 healthy controls walked on a treadmill at their self-selected speed under BW and forward walking (FW) conditions. Surface electromyography (EMG) data for the peroneus longus, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius and gluteus medius muscles were collected. EMG amplitude normalized to maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) and the standard deviation (SD) of the %MVIC EMG amplitude was calculated throughout the gait cycle. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) of the %MVIC EMG amplitude was calculated before and after initial contact (pre-IC: 90-100% of stride; post-IC: 0-10% of stride). Results: No differences between groups were noted in the %MVIC amplitude or activation variability (SD of %MVIC EMG) under BW or FW. In both groups, decreased tibialis anterior (p < 0.001) and gluteus medius (p = 0.01), and increased medial gastrocnemius (p < 0.001) activation were observed during pre- and post-IC under BW condition. Conclusion: Participants with CAI and healthy controls have similar muscle activity patterns during BW. Yet, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the CAI population. ? 2020 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s12891-020-03512-x,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 35 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy between October 2017 and October 2018. There were 19 males and 16 females with an average age of 43.4 years (range, 18-60 years), with 20 cases of left knee and 15 cases of right knee. The causes of injury included traffic accident in 14 cases, falling injury in 13 cases, and sports injury in 8 cases. The time from injury to operation ranged from 3 to 9 days (mean, 4.7 days). The patients suffered from swelling, pain, and limited mobility of knee joint before operation. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were positive before operation, whereas MRI was taken to confirm the ACL rupture. After operation, the patients were followed up every 3 months until the knee joint's function returned to normal. MRI and X-ray films were used to observe the tendon-bone healing as well as the position of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were conducted to observe the improvement of knee joint mobility. The functional improvements were evaluated by the International Knee Documents Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, knee injury and osteoarthritis (KOOS) score. Results: All the 35 patients were followed up 12-18 months, with an average of 14.2 months. The incisions healed by first intention, and no complications such as infection, joint stiffness, and rerupture occurred. Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test turned to be negative of all patients. MRI showed that the ACL was continuous, and the tendon-bone in the distal femur tunnel and proximal tibia tunnel recovered well after operation. X-ray films showed that the positions of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail were stable. The IKDC, Lysholm, and KOOS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation were significantly improved when compared with those before operation, and the scores were further improved with time after operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: For patients with ACL rupture, ACL reconstruction with the autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy has satisfactory effectiveness of quick recovery, good function, and great stability.",Scopus,10.7507/1002-1892.201911145,Chinese Journal of Reparative and Reconstructive Surgery

Methods: Eighty healthy New Zealand white rabbits were harvested to prepare ACL injury models and randomly divided into two groups ( n=40). The ACL was reconstructed with vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft in group A and peroneus longus tendon graft without blood supply in group B. The survival of animals and the healing of incision were observed after operation; the grafts were taken for gross and histological observations at 4, 8, and 16 weeks; the biomechanical test of the grafts was carried out to record the maximum tensile strength and incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks. Results: All animals survived until the experiment completed. General observation showed that the tunnel was combined with grafts, the vascular infiltration was abundant, and no obvious boundary between the tunnel and grafts existed at 16 weeks in group A; there was still an obvious boundary between the tunnel and graft in group B. Histological observation showed that the collagen fibers between tendon and bone in group A increased gradually, the dense fiber connection was formed, and the ""tidal-line"" like structure similar to the normal ACL insertion was formed at 16 weeks; but the""tidal-line"" like structure was not obvious in group B. Biomechanical test showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of ACL insertion rupture at 8 and 16 weeks between group A and group B ( P=0.680; P=0.590), but the maximum tensile strength at 8 and 16 weeks were higher in group A than in group B ( t=18.503, P=0.001; t=25.391, P=0.001).

1226,SC-609,Killinger et al. (2020),2020,The effects of blood flow restriction on muscle activation and hypoxia in individuals with chronic ankle instability,"Context: Muscle dysfunction is common in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Blood flow restriction (BFR) may enhance muscle responses during exercise and provide an opportunity to enhance muscle adaptations to ankle rehabilitation exercises; however, there is no evidence examining the effect of BFR on muscle function in CAI patients. Objective: Examine the effects of BFR on muscle activation and oxygen saturation during submaximal ankle eversion and dorsiflexion exercises in individuals with CAI. Design: Cross-over study design. Setting: Laboratory setting. Patients (or Other Participants): Nineteen young adults with a history of CAI. Interventions: Participants performed 4 sets (30, 15, 15, and 15) of eversion and dorsiflexion resistance exercises at 30% of maximum voluntary isometric contraction during 2 conditions, BFR and control. For BFR, a cuff was applied above the knee at 80% of blood flow occlusion. For control, the cuff was not inflated. Main Outcome Measures: Fibularis longus and tibialis anterior electromyography muscle activation, lower-leg muscle oxygen saturation, and ratings of perceived exertion were recorded during exercises. Results: Average grand mean muscle activation was 5.6% greater during eversion (P = .03) and 7.7% greater during dorsiflexion (P = .01) resistance exercises with BFR compared with control; however, the magnitudes of the effects of BFR were only clinically important during the dorsiflexion exercises. Lower-leg muscle oxygen saturation was 31% to 44% lower (P < .001) during BFR exercises. Ratings of perceived exertion were significantly higher during BFR exercises (P < .001). Conclusions: Greater muscle activation and hypoxia were present during submaximal resistance exercise with BFR in participants with CAI. Greater muscle activation and hypoxia during BFR exercises may be important acute responses mediating the training-related muscle adaptations that have been observed with BFR. The presence of these acute responses in CAI patients supports further research examining BFR as a potential ankle rehabilitation tool. ? 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/JSR.2018-0416,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

The aim of this intervention study with a within-subject design was to examine the effects of different elastic tapes (Kinesiotape - KT, IQ-Tape - IQ, without tape: OT) on the neuromuscular activation of the flexor and extensor chain of the lower extremity when jogging, climbing stairs and performing drop jumps. Subjects/Methods Eighteen healthy adults (5 males and 13 females) with mean age of 26.29 ñ 3.57 years and a body mass index of 22.3 ñ 0.7 kg/m 2were recruited. The participants performed stair climbing, drop jumping and running at 10 km/h, 12 km/h and 15 km/h. Muscle activation of the vastus medialis and lateralis and biceps femoris and semitendinosus muscles, tibialis anterior muscle, gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis muscle were assessed to record the ratio of muscle activation of the anterior tibial muscle and the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis muscles (T/G ratio) and the ratio of muscle activation of the vastus medialis and lateralis muscles and the biceps femoris and semitendinosus muscles (Q/I ratio) at the time before (-150 to 0 ms pre), during (0-30 ms post) and from 30 ms to 150 ms after the first ground contact by means of electromyographic measurements. The statistical analysis was carried out by means of the non-parametric L Puri Sen method. The significance level was set to < 0.05. Results Two participants withdrew from the study. The raw data of 16 participants was analysed. During climbing down stairs, IQT shows a significantly better T/G ratio in the pre-activation phase (-150 to 0 ms) compared with no tape (p = 0.01). The comparison of the remaining applications with KT, IQT and no tape revealed no significant differences (p < 0.05) Conclusion It can be assumed that Kinesiotape (KT) und IQ-Tape (IQ) do not cause any relevant detectable changes in muscle activation in healthy individuals.

1228,SC-611,Watson et al. (2020),2020,THE EFFECTS OF MULTIPLE MODALITIES OF COGNITIVE LOADING ON DYNAMIC POSTURAL CONTROL IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC ANKLE INSTABILITY,"Background: Evidence of neuroplasticity after joint injury has suggested that individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) may have degraded movement when facing cognitive demand. To date, research into these effects have been limited to static balance models, and typically only incorporate a single type of cognitive demands. Research question: We aimed to determine the effects of multiple modalities of cognitive load (quantitative, verbal-memory, visuospatial) on dynamic postural control strategies in a sample of patients with CAI compared to uninjured controls. Methods: Thirty-two participants (16 CAI, 16 healthy) performed a series of 20 hops-to-stabilization while either under no cognitive load (CON), or while performing Benton's judgment of line orientation (JLO), the symbol digit modalities test (SDM), or a serial seven task (SVN). Dynamic postural stability indices and mean muscle activation from the lower leg muscles were extracted and assessed via analysis of variance. Results: Healthy subjects demonstrated better vertical and dynamic postural stability indices under JLO (P ó 0.017) and SVN (P ó 0.010) conditions compared to CON. Postural stability was unaffected in CAI (P > 0.050). Peroneus longus and lateral gastrocnemius activation was lowest in SVN across all subjects (P ó 0.033). Lateral gastrocnemius activation was greatest in SDM (P ó 0.033). Significance: These results suggest improvements in postural stability under cognitive demand in healthy individuals that did not occur in CAI, suggesting less movement optimization. Quantitative tasks appear to impede stabilizing muscle activation in the leg, while verbal-memory tasks result in a more protective landing strategy. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.03.019,Gait and Posture
1229,SC-612,Bouillon et al. (2020),2020,Comparison of muscle activity using unstable devices during a forward lunge,"Context: Unstable devices in various forms are used as therapeutic adjuncts for prevention or following an injury. A slip-overthe- shoe design with inflatable domes (STEPRIGHT? Stability Trainer) was developed to improve balance. It is unknown how this unstable device affects muscle activity during a closed-chain exercise such as the forward lunge. Objective: To compare muscle activity across 3 surfaces (STEPRIGHT?, Both Sides Up [BOSU?] Balance Trainer, and firm) during a forward lunge. Design: Within-subject, repeated measures. Setting: University physical therapy research laboratory. Participants: A total of 20 healthy, recreationally active subjects (23.4 [1.47] y, 172.7 [14.7] cm, 71.6 [16.8] kg). Intervention: Each subject performed 1 set of 10 repetitions of forward lunge exercise in random order with STEPRIGHT?, BOSU?, and firm surface. Main Outcome Measures: Surface electromyography data, normalized to maximum voluntary isometric contractions (%MVIC), was used to assess muscle activity on rectus femoris, vastus medialis oblique (VMO), biceps femoris, lateral gastrocnemius, fibularis longus, and tibialis anterior. Results: The repeated-measures analysis of variance determined that there was a significant effect for surface type. During the descent of the lunge, the STEPRIGHT? elicited higher rectus femoris (33% [27%] MVIC) compared with BOSU? (22% [14%] MVIC) and VMO (44% [15%] MVIC) on STEPRIGHT? compared with firm (38% [11%] MVIC) (P < .05). During the ascent of the lunge, the rectus femoris (38% [27%] MVIC) using STEPRIGHT? was higher than BOSU? (24% [16%] MVIC), and STEPRIGHT? elicited higher VMO (65% [20%] MVIC) versus BOSU? (56% [19%] MVIC) (P ó.01). The STEPRIGHT? for fibularis longus was higher (descent: 51% [20%] MVIC, ascent: 52% [22%] MVIC) than BOSU?

(2020),2020,Socio-economic impact of supervised exercise in ACL rehabilitation,"Socioeconomics is a social science that investigates the impact and form of economic activity on social processes. In general, it analyzes the development, decline or decline of industrial societies due to their local or national or global economies. Companies are divided into three categories: social, cultural and tax. It also examines how economic and social factors influence the environment. Economic value can be defined as a measure of the profit to an economic agent from a good or a service. It is normally expressed in currency units. Another definition is that economic value is the average amount that an agent is willing to pay for a good or a service. There should be no confusion between economic value and market value, which is the minimum amount a consumer will pay for a good or service. Economic value is most always greater than consumer value.

(2020),2020,"Effect of Initial Graft Tension During Anterior Talofibular Ligament Reconstruction on Ankle Kinematics, Laxity, and In Situ Forces of the Reconstructed Graft","Background: Although a variety of surgical procedures for anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) reconstruction have been reported, the effect of initial graft tension during ATFL reconstruction remains unclear. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study investigated the effects of initial graft tension on ATFL reconstruction. We hypothesized that a high degree of initial graft tension would cause abnormal kinematics and laxity. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Twelve cadaveric ankles were tested with a robotic system with 6 degrees of freedom to apply passive plantarflexion and dorsiflexion motions and a multidirectional load. A repeated measures experiment was designed with the intact ATFL, transected ATFL, and reconstructed ATFL at initial tension conditions of 10, 30, 50, and 70 N. The 3-dimensional path and reconstructed graft tension were simultaneously recorded, and the in situ forces of the ATFL and reconstructed graft were calculated with the principle of superposition. Results: Initial tension of 10 N was sufficient to imitate normal ankle kinematics and laxity, which were not significantly different when compared with those of the intact ankles. The in situ force on the reconstructed graft tended to increase as the initial tension increased. In situ force on the reconstructed graft >30 N was significantly greater than that of intact ankles. The in situ force on the ATFL was 19 N at 30ø of plantarflexion. In situ forces of 21.9, 30.4, 38.2, and 46.8 N were observed at initial tensions of 10, 30, 50, and 70 N, respectively, at 30ø of plantarflexion. Conclusion: Approximate ankle kinematic patterns and sufficient laxity, even with an initial tension of 10 N, could be obtained immediately after ATFL reconstruction. Moreover, excessive initial graft tension during ATFL reconstruction caused excessive in situ force on the reconstructed graft. Clinical Relevance: This study revealed the effects of initial graft tension during ATFL reconstruction. These data suggest that excessive tension during ATFL reconstruction should be avoided to ensure restoration of normal ankle motion. ? 2020 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546520902725,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1236,SC-619,Bruce Leicht et al. (2020),2020,The Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Chronic Ankle Instability,"Purpose Given maladaptive neuroplasticity after musculoskeletal injury, interventions capable of restoring corticospinal excitability should be considered. We therefore aimed to determine if a 4-wk intervention of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (aTDCS) with eccentric exercise would improve neural excitability, functional performance, and patient-reported function in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Methods Twenty-six individuals with CAI were recruited to undergo 4 wk of eccentric evertor strengthening. Subjects were randomized into aTDCS (n = 13) and sham (n = 13) groups, where the aTDCS group received 18 min of aTDCS (1.5 mA) over the primary motor cortex. Participants were assessed for cortical excitability, dynamic balance, muscle activation, functional performance, strength, and patient-reported function at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6. Results Twenty-two subjects completed the training and test sessions. Cortical excitability (resting motor threshold) to peroneus longus in aTDCS increased from baseline (36.92 ñ 11.53) to week 6 (32.91 ñ 12.33, P = 0.024), whereas sham increased excitability from baseline (36.67 ñ 12.74) to week 2 (27.86 ñ 14.69, P = 0.007), but decreased at week 4 (35.63 ñ 13.10, P = 0.022) and week 6 (35.99 ñ 13.52, P = 0.006). Dynamic balance and muscle activation also improved in the aTDCS group from baseline to week 6 (P = 0.034). Functional performance on a side-hop test increased in all participants from baseline to week 2 (P = 0.003). The aTDCS group had decreased perceived disablement from week 2 (18.09 ñ 6.41) to week 4 (15.55 ñ 4.82, P = 0.046), whereas the sham group reported increased disablement from baseline (17.91 ñ 4.59) to week 2 (21.00 ñ 8.52, P = 0.047). Conclusions Our results provide preliminary evidence that 4 wk of eccentric training with aTDCS improves cortical excitability, functional performance, and patient-reported function in individuals with CAI. These data are the first to show the efficacy of noninvasive brain stimulation therapies in patients with musculoskeletal injury, and demonstrate the link between improved neural excitability and functional outcomes. ?

1237,SC-620,Herb et al. (2020),2020,Chronic ankle instability patients exhibit higher variability in lower extremity joint-coupling variability during drop vertical jumps,"Chronic ankle instability (CAI) has been associated with biomechanical alterations during landing tasks. While joint coupling differences have been reported during gait in patients with CAI, there is no known research assessing joint coupling during a drop-vertical jumping (DVJ). Joint coupling variability measure may provide information on the sensorimotor health of these patients. The purpose of this study was to compare lower extremity joint coupling variability during a DVJ between patients with CAI and controls. Twenty-eight young, active individuals (CAI:n = 14, Control:n = 14) participated in the study. A 3D motion capture system was used to collect kinematics during 15 drop-vertical jump trials. A vector coding analysis was used to assess the variability in the following joint couples: knee sagittal-ankle frontal, knee sagittal-ankle sagittal, hip frontal-ankle frontal, and hip frontal-ankle sagittal. The CAI group had higher joint coupling variability in hip frontal-ankle sagittal, knee sagittal-ankle frontal and knee sagittal-ankle sagittal planes both prior to and following ground contact during the drop vertical jumps. These changes indicate potential adaptations to the constraint of CAI and the task of the DVJ. Higher variability may reflect an attempt by the subjects to explore alternate movement strategies or reflect poor sensorimotor control strategies. Clinicians should consider the challenges of DVJ during rehabilitation as they create a unique task constraint. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2019.109479,Journal of Biomechanics

Methods: From January 2015 to September 2016, a total of 24 patients with proximal injury of ACL, confirmed by arthroscopy, were admitted to the sports medicine department of our hospital. The ACL was completely ruptured from the proximal footprint and the tibial side residual remained intact. There were 19 males and 5 females; 16 cases on the right side and 8 cases on the left side. The mean age was 27.88ñ7.13 years old; The interval between injury and surgery was 14.83ñ9.09 d; The dissociate peroneus longus tendon and semitendinosus tendonfrom the injured extremity were folded in half, then braided and trimmed into ACL graft for use. The ACL remnant was preserved and the graft was pulled through the stump for single bundle anatomic intrathecal reconstruction. The ACL graft was fixed with Endobutton on the femoral side and interference screw on the tibial side. The results of Lachman test, Lysholm scores, Tegner scores and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores of knee before operation and at final visit were recorded to evaluate the stability and function of the knee. Visual analogue score (VAS) was used to record the changes of pain at the site where the peroneal longus tendon was harvested. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scores were recorded before injury and at the final visit to assess the effect of ankle function after peroneal longus tendon resection. Results: The diameter of the ACL graft made of dissociate peroneus longus tendon and semitendinosus tendon is 8.88ñ0.30 mm. All patients were followed up at the outpatient clinic, with an average of 34.38ñ5.40 months, and no serious complications such as rerupture and joint infection were found. There were 16 grade B, 6 grade C and 2 grade D for preoperative Lachman test, none with hard end point. At last vist, there were 23 cases of grade A and 1 grade B, all with hard end points for Lachman test. At the preoperative and final visit, the Lysholm scores of the knee joint were 35.20ñ11.92 and 94.29ñ2.92 (t=23.850, P=0.000). Tegner scores were 3.46ñ0.93 and 8.04ñ1.00 (t=16.653, P=0.000). The subjective IKDC scores of knee joint were 47.63ñ13.06 and 91.71ñ3.75 (t=15.972, P=0.000). At the final visit, all the indicators of the knee were improved compared with those before surgery, and the difference was statistically significant.The AOFAS scores before injury and at the final visit were 98.83 (2.78) and 98.17 (4.01), respectively, with no statistically significant difference (t=1.850, P=0.076). The VAS scores for the harvest of theperoneus longus tendon were 4.50ñ1.41, 0.54ñ0.65 and 0.29ñ0.55 immediately and 6 months after the operation and at the last visit.There was statistically significant difference between the scores immediately and 6 months after the operation (t=14.900, P=0.001).There was statistically significant differences between the scores at 6 months after the operation and the final visit (t=2.770, P=0.011). Conclusion: Single bundle anatomic intrathecal reconstruction of proximal injury of ACL using dissociate peroneus longus tendon and semitendinosus tendon is feasible with good clinical effect. ? ? 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.",Scopus,10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2352.2020.02.002,Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics

There are many studies concerning hamstring tendon regeneration, but there are few studies on the regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon after ACL reconstruction. AIM: This study aimed to investigate whether regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon occurs after ACL reconstruction with magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent ACL reconstruction with donors from the peroneus longus tendon by the same operator and were followed 12 months later with bilateral crural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for comparison of the donor and healthy peroneus longus tendon areas. Regeneration was assessed at 5 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm from the ankle joint. RESULTS: The average age 30.4 (18-38) years old. There were 17 right and 8 left knees involved in this study. The interval between surgery and MRI was 1 year. The average regeneration presentation was located in the distal part (5 cm from the ankle joint) 66.78%, medial part (10 cm from the joint) 63.2%, and proximal part (15 cm from the ankle joint) 67.53%. There was no significant difference in the presentation of proximal, medial, and distal areas while there was a significant difference between age and regeneration of the proximal area, p <0.05 (p = 0.047). Tissue regeneration was tendinous and it appeared smaller in the place where the tendons grew. CONCLUSION: Regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon occurred after ACL reconstruction at a 1-year follow-up according to MRI. ? 2020 Sholahuddin Rhatomy, Bambang Kisworo, Bunarwan Prihargono, Faiz Alam Rashid, Nolli Kressoni.",Scopus,10.3889/oamjms.2020.5487,Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences

The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on knee strength, and muscle latency after sudden inversion of amateur futsal players. Methods: Seventy-one male futsal players were recruited and randomized to a FIFA 11+ (n = 37, age: 27.0 ñ 5.1 years) and a control group (n = 34, age: 26.0 ñ 5.1 years). The FIFA 11+ programme was executed twice a week, for 10 weeks, followed-up after 10 weeks where both groups executed regular warm-ups. Concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee muscle strength was tested and latency time of the evertor muscles after sudden inversion of the ankle was executed with a trapdoor mechanism following an EMG protocol of selected leg muscles (peroneus brevis and peroneus longus). Results: No significant difference were observed between groups for short-term changes in isokinetic strength after adjustment for baseline differences. At long-term, significant gains were obtained after adjustment for baseline differences in eccentric strength for both lower limbs as for the H/Q ratios for the dominant limb. No changes between groups were observed in the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus latency time. Conclusions: Performing FIFA 11+ did not have short-term effects on knee strength and muscle latency after sudden inversion in amateur futsal players. However, significant long-term benefits were observed for eccentric strength and H/Q ratios.ÿ. ? 2019, ? 2019 European College of Sport Science.",Scopus,10.1080/17461391.2019.1609588,European Journal of Sport Science

(2020),2020,Repair of chronic Achilles tendon rupture using Bosworth?s technique,Background: A large number of ruptures of the Achilles tendon occurs in the watershed hypovascular region (zone II) of the tendon which is approximately 2?6 cm proximal to the insertion of tendon at calcaneum. Chronic Achilles tendon rupture in the watershed area makes end to end repair of tendon less feasible and the neglected distal stump is often inapt for repair. A number of surgical techniques have been described for repair of chronic Achilles tendon in zone II. Our study was conducted with the objective of determining the efficacy and functional outcome of Bosworth?s technique that involves gastrocnemius-soleus turndown of proximal Achilles tendon. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in a total of five patients with chronic tear of Achilles tendon and the Bosworth technique was used for repair in all the patients. All the patients were followed up for a period of 1 year and the functional outcome was assessed by scoring system devised by Leppilahti et al. Results: four out of the five patients showed excellent functional at the end of 1 year follow up. A good functional outcome was seen in one of the patients. All the patients were able to resume work 6 months postoperatively. Conclusion: The Bosworth?s technique is an excellent surgical procedure for repair of chronic Achilles tendon rupture in the watershed zone of the tendon. ?

A total of 109 patients were included in the study. According to the leukocyte content the PRP injections were prepared as low-leukocyte content PRP (PPRP) and high concentration leukocyte content PRP (L-PRP). Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (n=44) received low-leukocyte content PRP and Group II (n =65) received highleukocyte content PRP. The patients were evaluated clinically with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Knee Society Score (KSS). The changes in the PLT levels of the L-PRP group after the procedure compared to the levels prior to the procedure were found to be statistically significantly greater than the changes in the PPRP group. The mean VAS score of all the cases before treatment was 9.05ñ0.91 and this score decreased to 3.71ñ1.46 within 12 months.

(2020),2020,"Application of the Long Fibular Tendon in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Plastic Surgery: Biomechanical Properties of the Graft, Correlation Relationships","Surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament with its injuries is currently one of the most frequent in sports traumatology. There are many methods for its implementation, but one of the most frequent questions is the choice of a transplant to replace it. The graft must withstand loads comparable to an intact ligament. It is necessary to choose the most suitable human tissue for this purpose. This article discusses the biomechanical characteristics of the long tibial tendon as a graft for the anterior cruciate ligament. Our results allowed us to evaluate the mechanical properties of the graft obtained from the tendon of the long fibular muscle to compare the data obtained with the available literature data describing the mechanical properties of the grafts used, and to show that the graft chosen for evaluation in this study is not inferior in its properties to those already used. The presence of a correlation between the graft diameter and the gender of patients suggests that further detailed statistical analysis will determine the possibility of accurate prediction of the graft diameter for high-quality preoperative planning. ? 2020.

1248,SC-631,Hemmati et al. (2020),2020,Five decades of research on phytoplasma-induced witches' broom diseases,"Phytoplasmas, prokaryotic wall-less microorganisms, are important pathogens of several plant species in most parts of the world. Phytoplasmas have been reported associated with various symptoms on hundreds of plant species. Witches' broom disease (WBD) is one of the most common disease symptoms, which is caused by phytoplasma strains belonging to different phytoplasma groups. Symptoms of the disease differ from one host to the other as well as from one phytoplasma strain to the other. However, WBD symptoms are usually characterized by the production of a large number of small leaves, accompanied in some host plants by the production of several branches/shoots. Phytoplasma strains belonging to more than 13 groups and 39 subgroups have been reported associated with WBD in more than 116 plant species. Most of the phytoplasma strains causing WBD symptoms in plant species belong to the 16SrII and 16SrI groups, mainly 16SrII-D and 16SrI-B subgroups.The current review provides information on the different types of phytoplasma strains associated with WBD symptoms in ornamental plants, medicinal plants, forest trees, weeds, vegetable crops, field crops, and fruit trees. Emphasis is on WBD on acid limes, almonds, peanuts, jujube, and cassava that have resulted in significant economic losses in different countries. Description of the symptoms, phytoplasma groups, and management options is also provided for some of the diseases. ?

(2020),2020,"Effective treatment for chronic ankle instability during lateral step-down?kinesiology tape, resistance exercise, or both accompanied with heel raise-lower exercise?","Context: Kinesiology tape (KT), multidirectional resistance exercise, and interventions for decreased ankle dorsiflexion range of motion are gaining popularity in the treatment of patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). However, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of combined interventions in patients with CAI. Objectives: To compare the effects of KT alone, KT with resistance exercise (KT + resistance), and KT with resistance and heel raise-lower exercise (KT + resistance + heel) on the results of the dynamic balance test (star excursion balance test [SEBT]), functional performance (lateral step-down test), and ankle muscle activation in patients with CAI. Design and Setting: This study used a repeated-measures design in a laboratory setting. Main Outcome Measures: The participants completed 3 different interventions with a 24-hour rest period between interventions. The SEBT, lateral step-down test, and ankle muscle activation results were used as the outcome measures. All outcomes were assessed before and immediately after the 3 interventions. Results: The results of the SEBT-anteromedial direction significantly increased with KT + resistance (78.61 [16.11] cm, P = .01, ES = 0.50) and KT + resistance + heel (76.94 [16.00] cm, P = .03, ES = 0.33) in comparison with the baseline values (73.68 [12.84] cm). Additionally, the result of the SEBT-anteromedial direction was significantly greater with KT + resistance (78.61 [16.11] cm) than with KT alone (76.00 [14.90] cm, P = .05, ES = 0.18). The number of errors during the lateral step-down test was significantly lower for the KT alone (2.16 [0.90] errors, P = .02, ES = 0.46), KT + resistance (2.10 [0.79] errors, P = .01, ES = 0.54), and KT + resistance + heel (2.03 [0.75] errors, P = .003, ES = 0.61) interventions than the baseline values (2.55 [0.85] errors). Conclusions: Patients with CAI should be encouraged to perform KT + resistance to improve balance. ? 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/JSR.2018-0073,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation
1250,SC-633,Telarolli et al. (2020),2020,Comparison of foot kinematics and foot plantar area and pressure among five different closed kinematic tasks,"Background: Different closed kinematic tasks may present different magnitudes of knee abduction, foot pronation, and foot plantar pressure and area. Although there are plenty of studies comparing knee abduction between different tasks, the literature lacks information regarding differences in foot pronation and foot plantar pressure and area. We compared foot angular displacement in the frontal plane and foot plantar pressure and area among five closed kinematic tasks. Methods: Forefoot and rearfoot angular displacement and foot plantar pressure and area were collected in 30 participants while they performed the following tasks: stair descent, single-leg step down, single-leg squat, single-leg landing, and drop vertical jump. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to investigate differences between tasks with à = 0.05. Results: Single-leg squat and stair descent had increased foot total plantar area compared with single-leg landing (P =.005 versus.027; effect size [ES] = 0.66), drop vertical jump (P =.001 versus P =.001; ES = 0.38), and single-leg step down (P =.01 versus P =.007; ES = 0.43). Single-leg landing and single-leg step down had greater foot total plantar area compared with drop vertical jump (P =.026 versus P =.014; ES = 0.54). There were differences also in rearfoot and midfoot plantar area and pressure and forefoot plantar pressure. Conclusions: Differences in foot-striking pattern, magnitude of ground reaction force, and task speed might explain these findings. Clinicians should consider these findings to improve decisions about tasks used during rehabilitation of patients with foot conditions. ? 2020, American Podiatric Medical Association.

1251,SC-634,Tua Lubis et al. (2020),2020,Combined hamstrings and peroneus longus tendon for undersized graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A report of two adolescence female patients,"Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury in young and active population and reconstruction is the mainstay treatment to maintain stability of the knee. Hamstring tendon (HT) is the most popular graft for ACL reconstruction. In certain patient, particularly in women, the size of tendon graft to reconstruct the ACL is unpredictable. In the case of unqualified donor, we need a combined graft from another source to match the size requirement. Case presentation: We present two cases of ACL reconstruction using combination of HT and PLT graft in adolescent female. We evaluate knee functional score and ankle donor site morbidity. In the second case we also did second look for the ACL graft integrity arthroscopically. This study has been reported in line with the Surgical Case Report (SCARE) criteria. Discussion: One year after surgery, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score for both cases were improved and no ankle-donor site morbidity with good motoric power and 100% American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Score (AOFAS). Conclusion: Additional peroneus longus tendon can be considered as an alternative in undersized hamstring tendon graft without significant donor site morbidity. ? 2020",Scopus,10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.09.136,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports
1252,SC-635,van der Merwe et al. (2020),2020,Foot Muscle Strengthening and Lower Limb Injury Prevention,"Background and objectives: The active and passive structures of the foot act in unison to not only be compliant enough to assist in ground reaction force attenuation but also resist deformation to provide a stable base of support. A foot that is unable to adjust to the imposed demands during high-intensity sporting activities may alter the moments and forces acting on the joints, increasing the risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament ruptures (ACLR) and lateral ankle sprains (LAS). Prophylactic strengthening programs are often used to reduce the risk of these injuries, but at present, very few prophylactic programs include foot-specific strengthening strategies. The aim of this theoretical review is to ascertain the prophylactic role strengthening muscles acting on the foot may have on ACLR and LAS injury risk. Methods: Literature relating to risk factors associated with ACLR and LAS injury and the anatomy and biomechanics of normal foot function was searched. In addition, ACLR and LAS injury prevention programs were also sought. A theoretical, narrative approach was followed to synthesize the information gathered from the articles. Results: The foot segments are governed by the congruity of the articulations and the activity of the foot muscles. As such, there is a coupling effect between shank, calcaneus, midfoot, and hallux movement which play a role in both ACLR and LAS injury risk. Conclusions: Strengthening the muscles acting on the foot may have a significant impact on ACLR and LAS injury risk. ? 2020, ? 2020 SHAPE America.",Scopus,10.1080/02701367.2020.1739605,Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport
1253,SC-636,Bagheri et al. (2020),2020,Effect of rocker-sole footwear on knee joint biomechanics while walking in people with ACL-reconstructed knees: A cross-sectional biomechanical study,"Reinjury has occurred at a high rate after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Low knee flexion angles and high peak posterior ground reaction forces in landing tasks increase ACL loading. Some studies reported that rocker-sole shoes increased knee flexion angle in the early stance phase of the gait. The aim of this study was to investigate the biomechanics of walking with a custom-made heel-to-toe rocker shoe design, with special attention to the sagittal knee joint kinematics of patients after ACL reconstruction.Methods:This study examined 10 male participants with ACL-reconstruction participants. Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed under two conditions of level walking that were tested in random order using either modified footwear adapted with a heel-to-toe rocker sole or baseline footwear with a flat sole. The knee flexion angle at initial foot contact with the ground, average knee flexion angle from heel strike to 25% stance phase, and first peak knee flexion angle were compared across footwear conditions.Results:Walking with the heel-to-toe rocker shoes increased the knee flexion angle at the early stance phase of the gait cycle when compared with the baseline footwear.Conclusions:Rocker-shoe intervention was found to have potential as a rehabilitation tool to modify gait patterns in the sagittal plane of people with ACL-reconstructed knees and may protect against high reinjury rates. Further research is required to evaluate whether prolonged wear of rocker-sole shoes can modify lower extremity biomechanics of participants who have undergone ACL reconstruction.Level of Evidence:Level II. ? 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

1254,SC-637,Song et al. (2020),2020,Biomedical microscope-assisted knee joint surgery and rehabilitation,"In the past, knee joint rehabilitation mainly included active flexion and extension activities in the early stage, passive manual joint loosening and muscle strength training in the later stage, and local physical therapy and ice compress treatment, which often left obvious joint flexion and extension obstacles, with different degrees of joint adhesion, stiffness and ligament soft tissue contracture. Based on the above background, the research content of this paper is biomedical microscope assisted knee surgery and late rehabilitation. In this paper, the application of biomedical microscope in knee surgery and late rehabilitation is analyzed under the background of biomedical microscope. Through the case analysis, the experiment proves that 40% to 70% of the DVT rate of the patients without preventive treatment after operation, and the main incidence is born in a large vein, about half of them appear in the lower leg. The incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism was close to 15%, among which 1% ~ 3.4% was fatal. Therefore, once DVT occurs, we should be alert to the embolism of heart, lung and brain. We can reduce swelling and prevent the formation of venous thrombosis by the repeated compression and relaxation of limbs from the end of hand and foot to the center of trunk through air bag. ? 2020, Interamerican Society for Electron Microscopy (CIASEM).

Methods A total of 21 eligible patients (mean age 34.0 years (standard deviation (SD) 11.2); mean follow-up period 31.8 months (SD 7.7), and 12 healthy controls (mean age, 26.8 years (SD 5.9) were included. For patients, clinical evaluation of the donor ankle was performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Square hop test, ankle strength assessment, and MRI of distal calf were assessed bilaterally in the final follow-up. The morphological symmetry of peroneal tendons bilaterally was evaluated by MRI in healthy controls. Results Among the patients, the mean pre- and postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score and Karlsson-Peterson score were 98.7 (SD 2.5; p = 0.480) and 98.5 (SD 2.4; p = 0.480), and 98.3 (SD 2.4; p = 0.162) and 97.9 (SD 2.5; p = 0.162), respectively. There was no significant difference between square hop test bilaterally (p = 0.109) and plantar flexion peak force bilaterally (p = 0.371). The harvested limb had significantly less eversion peak force compared to the contralateral limb (p < 0.001). Evidence of probable tendon regeneration was observed in all the patients by MRI and the total bilateral peroneal tendon index (mean ratio of harvested side cross-sectional area of peroneal tendon compared with the contralateral side) was 82.9% (SD 17.4). In 12 healthy controls, peroneal tendons (mean 99.4% (SD 4.3) were found to be morphologically symmetrical between the two sides. Conclusion The current study showed satisfactory clinical foot and ankle outcomes after full-thickness PLT harvesting and indicated the regenerative potential of PLT after its removal.

1256,SC-639,Shi et al. (2020),2020,Systematic evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, it has been reported that peroneus longus tendon can be used as a new graft material for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and can achieve the same effect as hamstring tendon. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the two graft materials for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect of reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament with peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon by meta-analysis. METHODS: We retrieved controlled clinical trials which compared the long peroneal tendons and hamstring tendons in reconstructing anterior cruciate ligament respectively in Chinese database (WanFang, CNKI, VIP, Chinese biological medicine) and English database (Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane library). The retrieval time was from database creation to March 2019. Literature screening and evaluation and data extraction were performed by two evaluators. Meta-analysis was evaluated using Revman5. 3 software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) A total of 413 Chinese or English literatures were retrieved and 10 of them were included in the final analysis. Among 647 patients receiving anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 271 patients used peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and 376 patients used hamstring tendon reconstruction. (2) Meta-analysis results: Postoperative functional score: There was significant difference in Lysholm score at postoperative 12 months (MD=1. 23, 95%C/[0. 31, 2. 51], P=0. 000 9) and IKDC score at postoperative 6 months (MD=3. 19, 95%C/[0. 07, 6. 31], P=0. 02) between peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and hamstring tendon groups. The occurrence of postoperative complications in the peroneus longus tendon group was significantly lower than that in the hamstring tendon group (OR=0. 15, 95%C/[0. 03, 0. 69], P=0. 01). However, there were no significant differences in Tegner scores, degree of joint motion, degree of joint relaxation at postoperative 6 and 12 months between peroneus longus tendon reconstruction and hamstring tendon groups. No significant difference was found in Lysholm score at postoperative 6 months and in IKDC score at postoperative 12 months between these two groups. The results showed that the clinical effect of peroneus longus tendon in reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament was comparable to that of hamstring tendon; in the peroneus longus tendon reconstruction group, the Lysholm score at postoperative 12 months and IKDC score at postoperative 6 months were significantly superior to those in the hamstring tendon group. The incidence of postoperative complications in the peroneus longus tendon reconstruction group was lower than that in the hamstring tendon group. The peroneus longus tendon can be clinically recommended to substitute hamstring tendon in the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. However, the quality of included literatures is limited; therefore higher quality of evidence is required to validate this conclusion. ? 2020, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

1257,SC-640,Vega et al. (2020),2020,Arthroscopic all-inside ATiFL?s distal fascicle transfer for ATFL?s superior fascicle reconstruction or biological augmentation of lateral ligament repair,"Purpose: Tendon grafts are often utilized for reconstruction of the lateral ligaments unamenable to primary repair. However, tendon and ligaments have different biological roles. The anterior tibiofibular ligament?s (ATiFL) distal fascicle may be resected without compromising the stability of the ankle joint. The aim of this study is to describe an all-arthroscopic and intra-articular surgical technique of ATiFL?s distal fascicle transfer for the treatment of chronic ankle instability. Methods: Five unpaired cadaver ankles underwent arthroscopic ATiFL?s distal fascicle transfer using a non-absorbable suture and a knotless anchor. Injured or absent ATiFL?s distal fascicle were excluded from the study. Following arthroscopy, the ankles were dissected and evaluated for entrapment of nearby adjacent anatomical structures. The ligament transfer was also assessed. The distance between the anterolateral (AL) portals and the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) was measured and the shortest distance was reported. Results: All specimens revealed successful transfer of the tibial origin of the ATiFL?s distal fascicle onto the talar insertion of anterior talofibular ligament?s (ATFL) superior fascicle. The fibular origin of the ATiFL?s distal fascicle remained intact. There were no specimens with SPN or extensor tendon entrapment. The median distance between the proximal AL portal and SPN was 3.8ÿmm. The median distance between the distal AL portal and SPN was 3.9ÿmm. Conclusion: An all-arthroscopic approach to an ATiFL?s distal fascicle transfer is a reliable method to reconstruct the ATFL?s superior fascicle. Transfer of ATiFL?s distal fascicle avoids the need for tendon harvest or allograft. The lack of injury to nearby adjacent structures suggests that it is a safe procedure. The clinical relevance of the study is that ATiFL?s distal fascicle can be arthroscopically transferred to be used as a biological reinforcement of the ATFL repair, or as an ATFL reconstruction. ? 2019, European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-019-05460-z,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"
1258,SC-641,Brambilla et al. (2020),2020,Lateral ankle ligament anatomic reconstruction for chronic ankle instability: Allograft or autograft? A systematic review,"Background: To investigate if there is any evidence in favour of autograft or allograft use for anatomic reconstruction of lateral ankle ligaments in patients with symptomatic chronic ankle instability. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases, over the years 1994?2017, to identify the studies presenting clinical results of anatomic lateral ankle ligaments reconstruction using various combinations of the keywords ?lateral ankle ligaments reconstruction?, ?anatomic reconstruction?, ?chronic ankle instability?, ?allograft?, ?autograft?. The surgical procedure was considered anatomic if consistent with the description of lateral ankle ligaments made by Burks and Morgan in 1994. Results: Among the 89 papers matching the search terms, only 12 could be included in which 357 anatomic lateral ankle ligaments reconstructions were performed. One was a comparative case series (level of evidence III ? LOE III) while other papers were retrospective case series (LOE IV), the mean Modified Coleman Methodology Score (MCMS) was fair: 56.7 (SD ñ 5.2). Due to the low level of evidence of the available literature only a qualitative analysis was performed. The limited evidence from the studies analysed suggests that there is no difference in graft survivorship, graft-dependent variables, patient's satisfaction, clinical outcome measures and radiographic results between allograft and autograft. Conclusions: Given the low number of studies, their poor methodology score and their low level of evidence it is not possible to determine if allograft is better or safer than autograft.

1259,SC-642,Vega et al. (2020),2020,Arthroscopic all-inside anterior talo-fibular ligament repair with suture augmentation gives excellent results in case of poor ligament tissue remnant quality,"Purpose: An increasing role of arthroscopy as the definitive treatment for ankle instability has been reported, and assisted or all-arthroscopic techniques have been developed. However, treatment of chronic ankle instability with poor remnant ligament-tissue quality is still challenging. The aim of this study was to describe the technique and report the results of the arthroscopic ATFL all-inside repair with suture augmentation to treat patients with poor remnant ligament-tissue quality. Methods: Fifteen patients [9 men and 6 women, median age 30 (19?47) years] with chronic ankle instability and poor remnant ligament-tissue quality were treated by arthroscopic means after failing non-operative management. Median follow-up was 18 (12?23) months. Through an arthroscopic all-inside technique, and using a suture passer and two knotless anchors, the ligament was repaired. Then, the anchor?s residual suture limbs were not cut, but were recycled and used for augmentation of the ligament repair. Results: Arthroscopic examination demonstrated an isolated anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) injury with poor remnant ligament tissue in the 15 patients. All patients reported subjective improvement in their ankle instability after the arthroscopic all-inside ligaments repair and suture augmentation. The median AOFAS score increased from 66 (44?87) preoperatively to 100 (85?100) at the final follow-up. Conclusion: Chronic ankle instability with poor remnant ligament-tissue quality can be successfully treated by an arthroscopic all-inside repair and suture augmentation of the ligament. The clinical relevance of the study is the description of the first arthroscopic all-inside anatomic ATFL repair with suture augmentation that offers the benefit of maintaining the native ligament while reinforcing the repair, especially in patients with poor remnant ligament-tissue quality.

(2019),2019,Preliminary result of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft,"BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the most successful operations in sports medicine. At present, ligament autografts have been the best method due to good histocompatibility, rapid healing, no cross-contamination, and low cost of treatment. However, autografts do not have infinite amount and are also not always feasible. Anterior half of peroneus longus tenden autograft is likely to become a source of autograft with many advantages. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT). AIM: To evaluate the initial outcome of ACL reconstruction arthroscopy by anterior half of peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This is a prospective non-controlled case series. RESULTS: A prospective study on 30 patients (from 9 / 2016 to 01 / 2019) had both ACL and MCL injury who had operated ACL reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT) at Department of General Orthopaedic and Trauma, Viet Duc hospital. Our outcome: the year average 35.4 ys, the rate of ACL rupture combined with meniscus injury was 40%. The average diameter AHPLT autograft is 7.0 mm. The function Lysholm scores improved from 59 to 94.27 postoperative 6 months. No difference beetwen the AOFAS scale of preoperative and postoperative.

An anatomic technique reconstructs these structures through 2 femoral sockets and 1 tibial and 1 fibular tunnel. This reconstruction can be performed using a peroneus longus autograft that is prepared as a Y construct. The peroneus longus autograft is preferred because it provides adequate length and diameter for the entire reconstruction. Initially, the doubled loop of the Y is passed into the tibial tunnel and fixed with an adjustable cortical button. The shorter limb of the Y is used for reconstruction of the popliteus tendon. The longer limb of the Y is passed from posterior to anterior through the fibular tunnel and is fixed in the tunnel with an interference screw to re-create the popliteofibular ligament. The remaining graft is then shuttled deep to the iliotibial band and superficial to the popliteus tendon, into the femoral socket, to re-create the fibular collateral ligament. ? 2019 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2019.07.024,Arthroscopy Techniques

(2019),2019,Are landing biomechanics altered in elite athletes with chronic ankle instability,"This study analyzed landing strategies used by athletes with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and copers compared to uninjured controls. Thirty participants were asked to perform a single-leg forward jump followed by a single-leg landing. Compared to uninjured controls, those with CAI athletes had significantly greater hip flexion and ankle eversion angles at initial landing, suggesting preference for using hip movements and extra ankle eversion angles to avoid ankle inversion when landing. CAI athletes were also found to have significantly decreased peroneus longus activation and higher ankle inversion velocity were both found during descending phase. And these were potential contributors to cause ankle inversion injury as there were likely many others. Based on these findings, CAI athletes may need to utilize more multi-joint or multi-muscle strategies during landing to maintain stability and prevent re-injury. ?

Nowadays, peroneus longus is used in ACL reconstruction. However, it is difficult to predict the peroneus longus graft diameter for ACL reconstruction. Thus, preoperative measurements are very important to predict peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction. Methods: A cohort retrospective study was conducted using consecutive sampling method from February 2016 until October 2017 in our center. We recorded patients? characteristics include gender, age, body weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) preoperatively. We measured peroneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively, and analysed data using Spearman correlation. Results: Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. There were 28 males and 11 females in the peroneus group. From the patients' mean characteristics, age was 25.10 ñ 9.16, body weight 71.23 ñ 14.17, height 169.13 ñ 8.81, and BMI 20.96 ñ 3.44. Intraoperative peroneus longus diameter measurement was 8.56 ñ 0.82. Spearman correlation showed significant correlation between intraoperative peroneus longus diameter with patient's height, body weight, and BMI with p < 0.05. Conclusion: Patients? characteristics including gender, height, weight, and BMI in preoperative measurements can predict peoneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively. ? 2019 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.amsu.2019.10.023,Annals of Medicine and Surgery

(2019),2019,Improvements in strength and functional performance after Kinesio taping in semi-professional male soccer players with and without functional ankle instability,"Objective: The objectives of this study were to compare the immediate effects of two methods of Kinesio taping on muscle strength, functional performance, and balance in athletes with and without functional ankle instability (FAI). Methods: The present study investigated the effects of distal taping (muscle application over peroneus longus) and proximal- distal taping (muscle application over gluteus medius and peroneus longus) on the strength of evertor and hip abductor muscles, side hop test, figure of 8 hop test, and star excursion balance test in semi-professional male soccer players with and without FAI (n = 15 in each group). A Multifactorial repeated measure ANOVA was used for comparison. Results: There were significant differences for factor effect in all outcome measures (P < 0.05), except for the figure of 8 hop test. No significant differences for group effects and group by factor interaction effects (P > 0.05) was observed except for the side hop test. Conclusion: Kinesio taping had immediate effects on improving strength, performance and balance. However, there were no differences on the method of application. Clinicians can consider the application Kinesio taping during the rehabilitation process of athletes with FAI, to improve balance and strength. The long-term impacts of taping on the functional, balance and strength measures should be investigated in future studies. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.foot.2019.06.006,Foot
1268,SC-651,Abdala et al. (2019),2019,Sesamoids in tetrapods: the origin of new skeletal morphologies,"Along with supernumerary bones, sesamoids, defined as any organized intratendinous/intraligamentous structure, including those composed of fibrocartilage, adjacent to an articulation or joint, have been frequently considered as enigmatic structures associated with the joints of the skeletal system of vertebrates. This review allows us to propose a dynamic model to account for part of skeletal phenotypic diversity: during evolution, sesamoids can become displaced, attaching to and detaching from the long bone epiphyses and diaphysis. Epiphyses, apophyses and detached sesamoids are able to transform into each other, contributing to the phenotypic variability of the tetrapod skeleton. This dynamic model is a new paradigm to delineate the contribution of sesamoids to skeletal diversity. Herein, we first present a historical approach to the study of sesamoids, discussing the genetic versus epigenetic theories of their genesis and growth. Second, we construct a dynamic model. Third, we present a summary of literature on sesamoids of the main groups of tetrapods, including veterinary and human clinical contributions, which are the best-studied aspects of sesamoids in recent decades. Finally, we discuss the identity of certain structures that have been labelled as sesamoids despite insufficient formal testing of homology. We also propose a new definition to help the identification of sesamoids in general. This review is particularly timely, given the recent increasing interest and research activity into the developmental biology and mechanics of sesamoids. With this updated and integrative discussion, we hope to pave the way to improve the understanding of sesamoid biology and evolution. ? 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society",Scopus,10.1111/brv.12546,Biological Reviews
1269,SC-652,Yuen et al. (2019),2019,Investigation the EMG activities of lower limb muscles when doing squatting exercise in water and on land,"(1) Background: Squatting is one of the common closed-kinetic chain (CKC) exercises for knee rehabilitation. Some patients cannot perform squatting exercises on land occasionally due to knee pain. Several studies had suggested that lower limb muscle activities are lower in water than on land while performing CKC exercises. The purpose of this study is to investigate the surface electromyography (sEMG) activities of Rectus femoris (RF) and Biceps femoris (BF) muscles when doing a squatting exercise in water and on land. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional experimental study. A total of 20 healthy participants (10 males, 10 females) were recruited by convenience sampling. The sEMG of RF and BF muscles in water and on land were collected and the knee motions were videotaped. Participants were instructed to perform closed kinetic-chain back squatting exercises at a specific speed (30 beats per minute) in water and on land at angular speed of 45?/s. Eight repetitions of the squatting exercise (0?90? knee flexion) were performed. The mean percentage maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) between two muscles was compared in two conditions. The %MVC of RF and BF muscles at different specific knee flexion angles (30?, 60? and 90? knee flexion) was also identified. (3) Result: Muscle activities of RF (p = 0.01) and BF (p < 0.01) muscles were significantly lower in water than on land. The %MVC of RF and BF muscles was found to be 15.01% and 10.68% lower in water than on land respectively. For different knee angle phases, the differences in %MVC between land and water had significant difference for both RF muscles and BF muscles. (4) Conclusion: This study found a difference of mean percentage MVC of RF and BF muscles between land and water in different phases of squatting. The water medium reduced the two muscles? activities to a similar extent. The result showed that the aquatic environment allows an individual to perform squatting with less muscle activation which may serve as an alternative knee exercise option for patients who encounter difficulty in land squatting due to lower limb muscle weakness or a high level of knee pain. ? 2019 by the authors.

1270,SC-653,Burland et al. (2019),2019,Alterations in physical and neurocognitive wellness across recovery after ACLR: A preliminary look into learned helplessness,"Objectives: Neural alterations after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) may initiate a maladaptive neurocognitive response (learned helplessness [LH]). Understanding the interrelationships between neural inhibition, quadriceps function and psychological responses can provide clinicians areas to target during recovery. The purpose was to longitudinally evaluate neural excitability, strength and self-reported LH after ACL injury and to explore the relationship between these measures and knee mechanics and patient reported function. Design: Case-series. Setting: University. Participants: Eight patients were evaluated across recovery after ACL injury. Main outcome measures: Neural activity, quadriceps function, and self-reported LH were evaluated at pre-surgery, 3-months post-ACLR and at the time of return to play (RTP). Results: Patients presented with higher helplessness between 3-months and RTP. Neural excitability and quadriceps function were variable and associated with various aspects of LH. These findings indicate a systemic inability to generate appropriate neural signaling to the quadriceps and highlights how these changes may influence perceived helplessness and overall function after ACLR. Conclusions: LH is related to both measures of physical function and neural outcomes and varies across recovery. This may provide clinicians with a feasible clinical tool that has the potential to identify a variety of impairments arising after ACLR. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2019.09.009,Physical Therapy in Sport
1271,SC-654,Rhatomy et al. (2019),2019,Peroneus longus autograft can be recommended as a superior graft to hamstring tendon in single-bundle ACL reconstruction,"Purpose: A peroneus longus tendon autograft is used in many orthopaedic procedures and it is biomechanically comparable to a hamstring tendon autograft. Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity of ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts versus peroneus longus tendon autografts in patients with an isolated ACL injury. Methods: Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1ÿyear after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. Results: Fifty-two patients (hamstring n = 28, peroneus n = 24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8 ñ 0.7ÿmm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2 ñ 0.8ÿmm) (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3 ñ 4.2 and for the FADI 98 ñ 3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.

1272,SC-655,Koldenhoven et al. (2019),2019,Gait kinematics & kinetics at three walking speeds in individuals with chronic ankle instability and ankle sprain copers,"Background: Individuals with CAI have demonstrated a more inverted foot position during walking when compared to a healthy control group. Copers are individuals who have had an ankle sprain but learn to cope and return to pre-injury levels of function and may be a better comparison group than healthy controls because they have had the same initial injury. Research question: A controlled laboratory study was performed to simultaneously analyze differences in lower extremity walking gait kinematics, kinetics, and surface electromyography (EMG) between individuals with CAI and copers at a preferred walking speed (PWS), 120% preferred walking speed (120WS), and standardized walking speed (SWS) of 1.34 m/s. Methods: Thirty-six (18 coper, 18 CAI) physically active individuals participated. Three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics at the ankle, knee, and hip and EMG amplitude for fibularis longus, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, and gluteus medius muscles were analyzed. Ten consecutive strides from each speed were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). A 2 ? 3 group by speed ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests were used to compare differences between the coper and CAI groups. Results: The CAI group had more ankle inversion at IC (PWS: MD = 4.2ø, d = 1.08; 120WS: MD = 5.0ø, d = 1.28; SWS: MD = 6.6ø, d = 1.37) and greater peak inversion throughout swing at all three walking speeds (PWS: MD = 4.2ø, d = 0.89; 120WS: MD = 4.4ø, d = 0.91; SWS: MD = 6.2ø, d = 1.21). The CAI group had greater peak hip adduction during swing (PWS: MD = 4.5ø, d = 0.96; 120WS: MD = 4.1ø, d = 1.04; SWS: MD = 3.6ø, d = 0.98). Significance: The CAI group demonstrated greater ankle inversion at IC and during the swing phase and greater peak hip adduction during the swing phase compared to the copers. As the speed increased, ankle inversion in the CAI group also increased which could be linked to greater risk of recurrent sprains. Therefore, modeling gait training programs after the coper mechanics may be advantageous. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.09.010,Gait and Posture
1273,SC-656,Goss et al. (2019),2019,Minimally Invasive Retrograde Method of Harvesting the Flexor Hallucis Longus Tendon: A Cadaveric Study,"Background: Use of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon is well described for several tendon augmentation procedures. Harvesting the FHL through an open medial approach is commonly done, but is associated with anatomic risks. Recently, several authors have described a minimally invasive (MI) technique to harvest the FHL tendon utilizing a hamstring tendon stripper commonly used in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of harvesting the FHL tendon using this novel minimally invasive retrograde approach. Methods: The FHL tendon was harvested through a transverse plantar incision over the interphalangeal joint of the great toe in 10 fresh-frozen cadaver lower extremities. A lateral-based incision for peroneal tendon repair was made and the FHL was retrieved. Tendon length, complications, and interconnections between the FHL and flexor digitorum longus (FDL) were recorded and classified. The specimens were then dissected by a single surgeon in a standardized fashion, and damage to any surrounding structures was recorded. Results: The average length of the FHL tendon from the distal stump to the first intertendinous connection was 13.3 cm (range 8.8-16 cm, SD 2.3 cm). Eight cadavers demonstrated Plaass type 1 interconnections whereas 2 demonstrated type 3. There was no injury to the medial and lateral plantar arteries and nerves, plantar plate, or FDL tendons. One FHL tendon was amputated at the level of the sustentaculum during graft harvest. No injury of the medial neurovascular structures occurred with retrieval of the FHL tendon through the lateral incision. Conclusions: We found that care must be taken when approaching the sustentaculum with the tendon harvester in order to avoid amputation of the graft against a hard bony endpoint. Additionally, flexion and extension of the lesser toes could aid in successful tendon harvest when tendon interconnections were encountered. Clinical Relevance: Using this MI technique appears to be a safe and effective way to obtain a long FHL tendon graft for tissue augmentation. ?

(2019),2019,Identification of the retrotalar pulley of the Flexor Hallucis Longus tendon,"Functional Hallux Limitus is the expression of the gliding restraint of the Flexor Hallucis Longus (Fhl) tendon, resulting in several painful syndromes. This impingement is located along the tract of the Fhl tendon at the level of its retrotalar tunnel sealed posteriorly by a fibrous pulley. This pulley, although poorly anatomically characterized, has been arthroscopically proven that its presence or resection plays a pivotal clinical role in the biomechanics of the lower leg, being the main restraint to the physiological movement of the Fhl tendon. The aim of our study was to identify and characterize this anatomical structure. Eleven cadaveric lower legs were initially assessed by computer tomography (CT) imaging, subsequently plastinated, dissected and histologically evaluated by use of Mayer's and Hematoxylin stain. We have shown that the retrotalar pulley of the Fhl shares the same histological characteristics with the retinaculum of the long fibularis muscle and the retinaculum of flexor digitorum muscle, thus it constitutes a different entity than the adjacent formations. ? 2019 Anatomical Society",Scopus,10.1111/joa.13046,Journal of Anatomy

(2019),2019,Chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency results in inferior quality hamstring autografts,"Background: Availability of a good quality autograft of adequate length is the first step towards a successful knee ligament reconstruction. Being able to predict the quality and length of hamstring autograft can go a long way in making the surgeon?s pre-operative planning a lot easier. The purpose of this study was to find out if any correlation existed between the duration of ACL injury with history of repeated instability episodes and the quality and length of Hamstring graft that was harvested. Methods: Forty consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using quadrupled Hamstring tendon graft were evaluated with regard to the duration of injury, number of instability episodes and graft characteristics like difficulty in harvesting the graft, quality and length of the graft. Results: We found a statistically significant difference between the usable length of harvested Hamstring tendon in patients with acute and chronic injury (p = 0.004). There was a significantly high risk of the graft being shorter and of poor quality in patients with chronic injury (odds ratio = 5.7). Conclusion: Chronicity of ACL injury with repeated strains can cause fibrosis at the musculotendinous junction and result in harvest of a poor quality and short hamstring autograft. A detailed history with regard to duration of injury and repeated instability episodes will help a surgeon plan better when anticipating a sub-optimal graft. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s00590-019-02467-7,European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology

Older patients can tolerate nonunion with impaired function including extension limitation or persistent muscle weakness. In young patients, performing rigid internal fixation with reoperation should be considered when a nonunion occurs. However, delayed and neglected nonunion in patella fractures require performing different surgical procedures. We report two cases, operated for a patella fracture, in whom nonunion occurred and accompanied by patellar migration and retraction of quadriceps tendon because of a fixation failure. We reconstructed the extensor mechanism with peroneus longus tendon autograft and, owing to this method, we achieved excellent functional results during a 2-year follow-up period. ? 2019 Delhi Orthopedic Association",Scopus,10.1016/j.jcot.2019.05.020,Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma

Research, however, has shown a lack of reliability or sensitivity of available methodologies. This study aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability and sensitivity of a novel lateral stability protocol, the Submaximal Lateral Shuffle Test (SLST). We recruited 11 and 40 participants to assess reliability and sensitivity of the SLST, respectively. Participants performed the SLST in footwear that differed in collar height and upper stiffness. ICC values showed good to excellent reliability in peak ankle angles and moments, ground reaction forces, impulses, stance time, and performance time. Significantly lower peak inversion and adduction angles and lower medio-lateral push off peak forces were found in the high cut shoes compared to the low cut shoes. The medio-lateral landing peak force showed lower forces in the high cut shoes. The smallest worthwhile change indicated meaningful differences in 70.0?82.5% of participants for inversion, adduction, medio-lateral landing peak, and push off peak forces. These results, however, were not systematic such that there was not a consistent direction of the difference for all participants. In conclusion, the SLST is a promising protocol to further investigate lateral stability in footwear. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,10.1080/02640414.2019.1620988,Journal of Sports Sciences

Adjustable loop femoral cortical suspension device is commonly used for femoral graft fixation during PCL reconstruction. AIM: This study purpose is to describe the functional outcome of PCL reconstruction using an adjustable loop femoral cortical suspension device. METHODS: This study used prospective design with consecutive sampling. All patients underwent PCL reconstruction with adjustable loop femoral cortical suspension devices using peroneus longus tendon autograft. Patients were evaluated at 6 months after surgery using posterior drawer test and functional outcome scoring system (Lysholm knee score, Cincinnati Score and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score). RESULTS: 20 patients were enrolled in this study with a mean age of 27.65 ñ 9.78.

1279,SC-662,Rhatomy et al. (2019),2019,Eversion and First Ray Plantarflexion Muscle Strength in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using a Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"Background: The peroneus longus tendon has been used as a graft in orthopaedic reconstruction surgery because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hamstring tendon. However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. Results: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 ñ 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P =.55), with means of 65.87 ñ 7.63 N and 66.96 ñ 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P =.68), with means of 150.64 ñ 11.67 N and 152.10 ñ 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 ñ 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 ñ 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. Conclusion: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity. This suggests that the peroneus longus tendon is a promising graft in ACL reconstruction. ? The Author(s) 2019.",Scopus,10.1177/2325967119872462,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine

(2019),2019,Decreased supraspinal control and neuromuscular function controlling the ankle joint in athletes with chronic ankle instability,"Purpose: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) alters lower extremity neuromuscular function, associated with a change in corticomotor excitability. The aim of this study was to compare corticomotor excitability and neuromuscular function of the muscles around the ankle between athletes with CAI and without CAI (non-CAI). Methods: Nineteen CAI athletes (15 men and 4 women) and 19 non-CAI athletes (15 men and 4 women) participated (age- and sex-matched). Corticomotor excitability was measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation for the following muscles: the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM). The resting motor threshold (rMT), motor evoked potential (MEP), and latency (Lat) were subsequently measured. Neuromuscular function was assessed with a jump test, using the EMG activity before foot contact, peak torque, and joint position sense. Results: The corticomotor excitability in CAI showed a lower normalized MEP in the TA (p = 0.026) and PL (p = 0.003), and longer latency in the TA (p = 0.049) and GM (p = 0.027) compared with non-CAI. The neuromuscular assessment showed CAI had less EMG activity of the PL (p < 0.001), less peak torque of the dorsiflexor (p = 0.019) muscle compared with non-CAI. Conclusion: Athletes with CAI had lower corticomotor excitability in the TA and PL and a longer latency in the TA and GM muscles. Additionally, CAI demonstrated functional neuromuscular deficits by decreasing EMG activity of the PL muscle and strength of the dorsiflexor muscle. Our findings indicated maladaptation at both cortical and peripheral levels among athletes with CAI. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s00421-019-04191-w,European Journal of Applied Physiology
1281,SC-664,Li et al. (2019),2019,Biomechanics of ankle giving way: A case report of accidental ankle giving way during the drop landing test,"Background: Several case studies observed that the lateral ankle sprain resulted from a sudden increase in ankle inversion accompanied by internal rotation. However, without sufficient ankle kinetics and muscle activity information in the literature, the detailed mechanism of ankle sprain is still unrevealed. The purpose of our case report is to present 2 accidental ankle giving way incidents for participants with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and compare to their normal trials with data of kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography (EMG). Case description: Two young female participants accidentally experienced the ankle giving way when landing on a 25ø lateral-tilted force plate. 3D kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity were recorded for the lower extremity. Qualitative comparisons were made between the giving way trials and normal trials for joint angles, angular velocities, moments, centers of pressure and EMG linear envelopes. Results: One participant's giving way trial displayed increased ankle inversion and internal rotation angles in the pre-landing phase and at initial contact compared to her normal trials. Another participant's giving way trial exhibited greater hip abduction angles and delayed activation of the peroneus longus muscle in the pre-landing phase versus her normal trials. Conclusion: A vulnerable ankle position (i.e., more inverted and internally rotated), and a late activation of peroneus activity in the pre-landing phase could result in the ankle giving way or even sprains. A neutral ankle position and early activation of ankle evertors before landing may be helpful in preventing ankle sprains. ? 2018",Scopus,10.1016/j.jshs.2018.01.002,Journal of Sport and Health Science

This study aimed to record the EMG of 5 healthy subjects on BIOPAC, using surface electrodes for their muscles such as biceps brachii, triceps, peroneus longus and gastrocnemius with and without the weight of 5 kilograms. They performed different hand and leg movements, each performed four times. Similarly, the EMG of four amputees was evaluated for their lower limb muscles by performing the lower limb movements. The slope, peak to peak, mean and area from their EMG signals were extracted to study the possible difference in their EMG. The amplitude of biceps and triceps muscles for the healthy subjects decreased with the passage of time both with and without weight because the muscles got fatigued quickly. The other parameters including slope, mean and area also decreased with time. There was difference in EMG values of lower limb for the healthy and amputee subjects as their muscle strength was weaker in phantom limbs. The mean and amplitude value of clenches increased due to increase in clench strength for the healthy subjects. ? 2019 IEEE.",Scopus,10.1109/RAEE.2019.8886920,0

It also aimed to determine a ball position that minimises excessive strain placed on the lower limb joints of the lead leg during the sweep pass. Methods A cohort of 18 female hockey-playing volunteers (age: 19.7ñ1.5 years; height: 165.5ñ5.4 cm; body mass: 66.4ñ7.0 kg) were recruited. Participants performed the sweep pass using three different ball positions: in front, in line with, and behind the heel of the lead (left) foot. Motion analysis and force plate data were collected. Moments and angles in all three planes of motion for the three main lower limb joints were then calculated using Vicon software. Results were statistically analysed using SPSS software. Results Significant differences (p<0.05) were found between the three tested ball positions for the mean maximum angles and moments, and mean ranges of motion produced at the lead three main lower limb joints. Positioning the ball in line with the heel of the lead foot resulted in the lowest moments and angles when compared with the other two ball positions. Conclusions The results indicate that positioning the ball in line with the heel of the lead foot is recommended to minimise the risk of injury to the lower limb joints during the hockey sweep pass. It is hoped that these findings will result in this position being implemented by players new to hockey or those returning to the sport following injury. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

(2019),2019,Posterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon graft: 2-Years follow-up,"Background: Several study that evaluate the usage of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction shows good result. Regardless the potential, there was no study about the use of PLT autograft in Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcome and donor site morbidity after single bundle PCL reconstruction using PLT autograft. Methods: Patient who met inclusion criteria, enrolled to this study and underwent single bundle PCL reconstruction using PL tendon autograft. Clinical outcomes were assessed with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati scoring systems, Lysholm score, and Serial hop test (single hop test and triple hop test) 2-year after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed with Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle (AOFAS) scoring system. Results: Fifteen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (11 males and 4 females). PLT graft diameters were 7.5?10 mm (mean: 8.30 ñ 0.65 mm). Significant increase of functional score (p < 0.05) were found two years after surgery. Mean score of IKDC was 47.58 ñ 11.75 pre-operative; 78.17 ñ 4.52 post-operative, Modified Cincinnati was 48.86 ñ 12.22 pre-operative; 79.00 ñ 4.82 post-operative, Lysholm score was 49.26 ñ 11.54 pre-operative; 80.20 ñ 5.04 post-operative. FADI and AOFAS at donor site ankle was 93.00 ñ 3.04 and 93.26 ñ 4.20, respectively. Serial hop test showed good result. Conclusion: PCL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft shows good functional outcome of the knee based on IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, Lysholm score, with preservation of ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI score at 2-years follow-up. ? 2019 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.amsu.2019.05.009,Annals of Medicine and Surgery
1285,SC-668,Wong et al. (2019),2019,Biomechanical and geometric characterization of peroneus longus allografts with respect to age,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are among the most common injuries in high impact sports, and reconstruction is the standard surgical procedure for these ruptures. Reconstructions are often performed using allografts rather than autografts on a case-by-case basis. Controversy exists as to whether or not age of donor tissue plays a factor in the mechanical properties of allografts. Methods: 38 peroneus longus (PL) tendons were prepared using the two-strand graft technique and then subjected to a cyclic loading test regimen of 1000 cycles to determine material properties. Specimens were grouped based on age to ascertain whether donor age affects the material properties of PL tendons. Findings: Secant modulus of the first cycle was determined to be 150.43 (SD 40.24) MPa. The average magnitude of the dynamic modulus was determined to be 82.81 (SD 24.65) MPa. Specimens were grouped into three distinct groups for analysis (x < 40 yo, 40 yo ó x < 60 yo, 60 yo < x). Interpretation: The need for using intrinsic material properties is highlighted. There is no significant difference in any intrinsic material property with respect to age or the fatigue of the tendon as the cycle count increases. Conversely, the measured stiffness of a tendon decreased as function of age with a large effect size. Based on analysis of graft geometries, it was determined that PL tendons become significantly more slender with increased age which result in the observed decrease in stiffness. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2019.04.017,Clinical Biomechanics
1286,SC-669,Brodell et al. (2019),2019,Deltoid-Spring Ligament Reconstruction in Adult Acquired Flatfoot Deformity With Medial Peritalar Instability,"Background: A spring ligament tear is commonly present in advanced stages of adult acquired flatfoot deformity (AAFD). Previous anatomic studies have demonstrated that the superficial deltoid ligament blends with the superomedial spring ligament, forming the tibiocalcaneonavicular ligament (TCNL). Adding allograft TCNL reconstruction to osseous correction has been suggested to augment medial peritalar stability in advanced AAFD with large spring ligament tears. We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of TCNL reconstruction for flexible AAFD with medial peritalar instability. Methods: Fourteen feet in 12 patients who underwent osseous and TCNL reconstructions for advanced AAFD (stage IIB with large spring ligament tears or stage IV) were recruited for the study. The mean postoperative follow-up was 24 (range, 12-33) months. Pre- and postoperative clinical outcomes were assessed by the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), SF-36, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Correction of forefoot abduction and the sagittal arch were measured from pre- and postoperative weightbearing radiographs. Results: The FAAM Activities of Daily Living improved from 69.3 to 90.1 (P =.001). The SF-36 Physical Function (PF) and Pain subscales both improved significantly (39.4 to 87.8 and 44.6 to 93.1, respectively, P <.001 for each). The PROMIS PF improved from 38.2 to 46.8 (P =.002) and the PROMIS Pain Interference (PI) from 62.6 to 50.1 (P =.003). Radiographic measures showed an improved anterior-posterior (AP) talo?first metatarsal angle of 24.7 to 11.8 degrees (P <.001) and talonavicular coverage angle of 47.4 to 23.1 degrees (P <.01). An improved Meary?s angle of 29.7 to 12.5 degrees (P <.001) and a calcaneal pitch angle of 11.7 to 16.9 degrees (P =.14) were noted in the lateral view. Conclusion: Considering the anatomic characteristics of the deltoid-spring ligament complex, TCNL reconstruction may play a significant role in maintaining peritalar stability when performed with osseous correction. Deltoid-spring ligament (TCNL) reconstruction is a viable surgical option for those with advanced stage AAFD with medial peritalar instability that leads to improved functional and radiographic outcomes.

Methods: Between June 2015 and February 2018, 28 patients with ACL rupture and MCL grade ? injury were treated. Arthroscopic GraftLink technique was used to reconstruct ACL with autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT), and suture anchor fixation was used to repair MCL. There were 22 males and 6 females, aged 21-47 years, with an average age of 30.4 years. The cause of injury included traffic accident in 18 cases, falling from height in 7 cases, and sports injury in 3 cases. The time from injury to admission was 1-2 weeks, with an average of 1.3 weeks. The preoperative Lysholm score of knee joint was 46.8ñ3.0 and the International Knee Documentation Commission (IKDC) score was 49.2ñ2.7. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of ankle joint was 98.29ñ0.72. Both Lachman test and valgus stress test were positive. There were 8 cases of meniscus injury and 2 cases of cartilage injury. Results: The operation time ranged from 55 to 90 minutes, with an average of 72.5 minutes. All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no complications related to operation occurred. All patients were followed up 6-38 months, with an average of 20.7 months. At 3 months after operation, the range of motion of the knee joint was 116- 132ø, with an average of 122ø. Lachman test showed that the anterior translation more than 5 mm in 2 cases, and the others were negative; while the valgus stress test showed that all patients were positive. At 6 months after operation, the Lysholm score and IKDC score of knee joint were 90.2ñ1.8 and 93.5ñ2.3, respectively, which were significantly higher than preoperative scores ( t=31.60, P=0.00; t=29.91, P=0.01); AOFAS score of ankle joint was 97.86ñ0.68, with no significant difference compared with preoperative score ( t=2.89, P=0.08). KT-1000 test showed that the difference of anterior relaxation between bilateral knee joints was less than 2 mm in 25 cases and 3 to 5 mm in 3 cases. Conclusion: The method of ACL reconstruction via arthroscopic GraftLink technique with PLT and MCL repair via suture anchor fixation has the advantages of less knee injury and faster recovery, and there is no significant impact on ankle function after tendon removal.",Scopus,10.7507/1002-1892.201812062,Chinese Journal of Reparative and Reconstructive Surgery

(2019),2019,Primary revision with replasty of the anterior cruciate ligament; Die prim„re Revision mit Replastik des vorderen Kreuzbandes,"Objective: Restoration of knee stability after rerupture of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft. Indication: Acute and chronic functional instability with rerupture of an ACL graft with subjective instability with anatomical or non-anatomical bone tunnel without tunnel widening. Contraindications: Partial anatomical bone tunnels of the previous operation, significant tunnel widening of anatomical bone tunnels, local infection of the knee joint, local soft tissue damage. Surgical technique: Graft choices are hamstring tendons (semitendinosus muscle, gracilis muscle), the quadriceps tendon, patellar tendon and aÿperoneus tendon split graft. In cases with anatomical tunnels, careful debridement is performed down to the tunnel wall.ÿIn non-anatomical tunnels, aÿnew femoral tunnel is drilled over aÿdeep anteromedial portal with the knee flexed more than 110ø in the insertion area of the ACL.ÿUsing drills and dilators, aÿtunnel is prepared.ÿAt the tibia, the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus serves as aÿlandmark in the absence of an ACL stump.ÿThe cortical tibial tunnel aperture is probed with aÿguide wire and the tunnel is drilled stepwise until the tunnel wall is reached, which is debrided with aÿspoon or synovial resector to remove graft residues and implants from the tunnel.ÿThe femoral fixation can either be done with aÿflip button, an interference screw or in the case of aÿbone block graft implant-free. At the tibial side, the graft is fixed with aÿresorbable interference screw and fixation button. Postoperative management: The rehabilitation program comprises 4?5ÿphases. Inflammatory phase (weeksÿ1?2): control of pain and swelling (cooling, isometric tension exercises, 20?kg partial load). Phaseÿ2 (weeks 2?6): increasing load and range of motion with closed chain exercises (target: extension/flexion 0?0?120ø). Phaseÿ3 (from weekÿ6): strength and coordination exercises. Phaseÿ4: balance, strength and jump exercises. Return to competitive sport not before postoperative month 6?10. Results: Included were 51ÿpatients with recurrent instability after ACL surgery where primary ACL replacement was performed with ipsilateral bone quadriceps tendon graft or contralateral semitendinosus?gracilis graft. All patients had anatomical or non-anatomical tunnel locations without significant widening (>11?mm). After 2ÿyears, the side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation measured with the KT 1000 arthrometer was 2.0?ñ 1.2?mm for the quadriceps group and 3.0?ñ 2.9?mm for the semitendinosus?gracilis group (P?= 0.461). No difference in the rate of positive pivot shift tests (P?= 0.661); no significant difference in the individual Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscores or in the frequency of anterior knee pain. ? 2019, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",Scopus,10.1007/s00064-019-0606-8,Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie
1289,SC-672,Tisherman et al. (2019),2019,Allograft for knee ligament surgery: an American perspective,"Purpose Allografts are frequently use for ligamentous reconstruction at the knee. In the United States, tissue donation and distribution are highly regulated processes with thorough oversight from private and government entities. Allograft is widely available in the United States and allograft procurement is a large industry with varying procurement, sterilization, processing, and distribution procedures. It is important to understand allograft regulation and processing which may affect graft mechanical properties and biological graft integration. Methods English-language literature, United States government and regulatory agency statues pertaining to allograft procurement, distribution, and usage were reviewed and the findings summarized. Results During the processing of allograft, multiple factors including sterilization procedures, irradiation, storage conditions, and graft type all affect the biomechanical properties of the allograft tissue. Biological incorporation and ligamentization of allograft does occur, but at a slower rate compared with autograft. For ligamentous reconstruction around the knee, allograft offers shorter operative time, no donor-site morbidity, but has shown an increased risk for graft failure compared to autograft. Conclusion This article reviews the regulations on graft tissue within the United States, factors affecting the biomechanics of allograft tissue, differences in allograft tissue choices, and the use of allograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and multiligamentous knee injury reconstruction. ?

(2019),2019,Clinical applications of allografts in foot and ankle surgery,"Purpose: The purpose of this review is to systematically analyse current literature on the use of allografts in the surgical treatment of foot and ankle disorders in adult patients. Based on this study, we propose evidence-based recommendations. Methods: The database for PubMed was searched for all published articles. No timeframe restrictions were applied. Clinical studies eligible for inclusion met the following criteria: performed on patients over 18ÿyears old; subject to surgical treatment of foot and ankle disorders; with report on the outcome of the use of allografts; with a report and assessment of pain and function, or equivalent; minimum follow-up of 1ÿyear was required. Two reviewers independently screened and selected studies for full-text analysis from title and abstract. 107 studies were included from 1113 records. Studies were grouped according to surgical indications into ten categories: musculoskeletal tumours (n = 16), chronic ankle instability (n = 15), ankle arthritis (n = 14), osteochondral lesions of the talus (n = 12), Achilles tendon defects (n = 11), other tendon defects (n = 9), fusions (n = 9), fractures (n = 8), hallux rigidus (n = 3) and other indications (n = 10). Results: Most studies displayed evidence level of IV (n = 57) and V (n = 39). There was one level I, one level II and nine level III studies. Most studies reported allografting as a good option (n = 99; 92.5%). Overall complication rate was 17% (n = 202). Conclusions: Fair evidence (Grade B) was found in favour of the use of allografts in lateral ankle ligament reconstruction or treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fracture. Fair evidence (Grade B) was found against the use of allogeneic MSCs in tibiotalar fusions.

A review of evolution, anatomy, clinical implications and biomechanical properties","Plantaris muscle (lat. musculus plantaris) is a fusiform muscle of the superficial posterior leg compartment, characterized with a small muscle belly and very long and slender tendon. Many anatomical variations of plantaris muscle have been reported previously, including its inconstancy. Evolutional studies strongly suggest that plantaris muscle is a rudimentary muscle that plays minor role in gait biomechanics. However, plantaris muscle seems to have very important proprioceptive role since it has very high density of muscle spindles. Clinically, plantaris muscle is involved in differential diagnosis of posterior leg pain and several pathological entities such as: plantaris muscle rupture, non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy and popliteal artery compression syndrome. Different surgical specialties have recognized plantaris muscle tendon as a valuable graft. However, literature on plantaris muscle tendon biomechanical properties is rather scant and inconsistent with several limitations for proper data comparison and interpretation. Further comparative studies are needed to properly define biomechanical properties of plantaris muscle tendon grafts for various ligament and tendon reconstructive procedures. ? 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.",Scopus,10.23736/S0022-4707.18.08816-3,Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness

(2019),2019,Clinical and radiologic outcomes following resection of primary proximal fibula tumors: Proximal fibula resection outcomes,"Purpose: Reconstruction of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and biceps femoris tendon following proximal fibula resection is controversial. Postoperative knee instability and peroneal nerve dysfunction affect outcome. This study aimed to determine functional, clinical, and radiological outcomes of patients who underwent en bloc proximal fibula resections and to compare clinical and radiological instability rates for primary repair after type I and type II resections. Materials and Methods: Eleven patients with primary tumors of the proximal fibula were included. Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score and Lysholm knee score were used in the evaluation of functional outcomes. Clinical outcome was assessed using knee range of motion and knee varus stress test. Radiological outcome was assessed using varus stress knee radiographs. Knee stability was evaluated using the varus stress test at 30ø of knee flexion and varus stress knee radiographs and graded in millimeters. Results: Of the 11 tumors, 6 (54.6%) underwent type I resection. In five (45.4%) patients, type II resection was performed. The mean follow-up period was 32 ñ 13.9 months (range, 12?55 months; median, 27 months). The mean knee joint lateral opening, MSTS score, and Lysholm knee score with type I versus type II resection were 5.7 ñ 1.2 mm versus 6.4 ñ 1.1 mm (p = 0.247), 28.7 ñ 1.8 (95.6%) versus 20.4 ñ 7.7 (68%) (p = 0.011), and 92.2 ñ 8.8 versus 62.8 ñ 20.4 (p = 0.026), respectively. Postoperative complications of all patients included one (9.1%) deep tissue infection and one (9.1%) long-term knee instability. In one patient (9.1%) who underwent type II resection, above-the-knee amputation was performed after local recurrence. Conclusions: Primary repair of the LCL and biceps femoris tendon to the surrounding soft tissues after resection of proximal fibular tumors provides good clinical outcomes. Primary repair is a simple technique to perform with minimal morbidity. Peroneal nerve palsy was a problem, especially in type II resections. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III. ?

Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking. We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ñ 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level. Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via active motor thresholds (AMT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI. Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected. 2 x 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences. Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs. Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls. No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls. ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain. Our results suggest that individuals with ACLR demonstrate systemic neural differences compared to controls, which are observed concurrently with smaller quadriceps muscle volume, quadriceps muscle weakness, and self-reported dysfunction. ?

(2019),2019,"Tensile strength comparison between hamstring tendon, patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon and peroneus longus tendon: A cadaver research","Knee ligament injury is a frequent occurrence. Ligament reconstruction using tendon graft is the best therapy recommendation in the case of severe knee ligament injury. Tendon graft that is oftenly used are hamstring tendon, patellar tendon (BPTB), quadriceps tendon and peroneus longus tendon have been proposed as tendon graft donor. Biomechanically, tensile strength from tendon graft is the main factor that greatly contributes to the success of ligament reconstruction procedure. Numerous researches have been done to calculate tensile strengths of hamstring and patellar tendon, but there has not been a research done yet on the comparison of the tensile strengths of peroneus longus tendon, hamstring, patellar tendon and quadriceps tendon. This research will strive to record the tensile strengths of peroneus longus tendon, hamstring, patellar tendon and quadriceps tendon as well as their comparison. Population of this research is 6 cadavers that have met the exclusion and inclusion criterias. From population above, 48 samples are retrieved and further divided into 4 groups. 12 samples for quadriceps tendon group, 12 samples for hamstring group, 12 samples for peroneus longus tendon group and 12 samples for patellar tendon group. Tensile strength measurement will then be done on each tendon by clamping both ends of examined tendon, then pulled on one side until tendon ruptures. Results are then read with a tensile tester. Tensile strength of peroneus longus tendon is not significantly different in comparison to hamstring tendon (p > 0,05). Whereas when compared to patellar and quadriceps tendons, peroneus longus and hamstring tendons have tensile strengths that are significantly higher (p < 0,05). Peroneus longus tendon have the highest tensile strength in comparison to the other three, followed by hamstring, quadriceps, and patellar tendons respectively. ? 2019",Scopus,10.1016/j.jajs.2019.02.003,Journal of Arthroscopy and Joint Surgery
1295,SC-678,Huang et al. (2019),2019,H-reflex in abductor hallucis and postural performance between flexible flatfoot and normal foot,"Objective: Morphological changes of the abductor hallucis muscle (AbH) in flexible flatfoot (FF) individuals influence regulations of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA). Prolonged and repeated stretching of AbH in flexible flatfoot may cause changes in muscle reflex properties and further influence postural performance. However, AbH muscle reflex under different postural conditions have never been examined. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in AbH H-reflex and postural performance between individuals with normal foot (NF) alignment and FF under prone, double-leg stance (DLS), and single-leg stance (SLS) conditions. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Individuals with FF (n = 12) and NF (n = 12). Main outcome measures: AbH H-reflex, AbH EMG and center of pressure (CoP) displacement. Results: Under all postural conditions, AbH H-reflex was significantly lower in the FF group (P <.05). Under the SLS condition, AbH EMG was significantly higher in the FF group (P <.05), and CoP displacement for the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions were significantly higher in the FF group (P <.05). Conclusions: With increased postural demand, FF individuals maintained their postural stability by recruiting greater AbH activities than through automatic stretch reflex, but FF individuals still showed inferior posture stability. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2019.02.004,Physical Therapy in Sport

Methods Ten participants with a history of a lateral ankle sprain and 10 controls performed three 20-s trials of single-leg static balance on a force platform under an eyes-open condition. Resultant sample entropy (SampEn) was used to assess static postural control performance. To assess white matter microstructure, fractional anisotropy (FA) of the superior cerebellar peduncles and corticospinal tracts was quantified using diffusion tensor imaging. In the case of statistically significant differences in FA, component diffusivities were evaluated, including mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity. Results Significant differences between participants with and without a history of lateral ankle sprains were observed in superior cerebellar peduncle FA and RD. Participants with a history of lateral ankle sprains had significantly lower FA in the superior cerebellar peduncle compared with controls. Participants with a history of lateral ankle sprains also demonstrated higher RD values in the superior peduncle compared with control. Finally, participants with a history of lateral ankle sprains had lower resultant SampEn values compared with controls. Conclusion Findings suggest that microstructural changes in white matter tracts governing postural control may be the biomarkers of central nervous system dysfunction in individuals with a lateral ankle sprain history. ? 2018 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1249/MSS.0000000000001848,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise

Methods: This retrospective study included 32 consecutive patients with chronic lateral ankle instability who underwent surgery from January 2013 to December 2014. All patients had failed to resolve with conservative treatment. A total of 32 ankles underwent AHPLT transfer. Patients returned for a clinical and radiologic follow-up evaluation at an average of 28 (range, 24?35) months postoperatively. Outcomes were assessed by comparison of pre- and postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, visual analog scale pain scores, and Karlsson scores, and the radiographic assessment including talar tilt and anterior talar translation. Results: Thirty-two patients (32 ankles) (100%) returned for final evaluation. All patients had an excellent or good outcome on patient subjective self-assessment, pain scores, AOFAS scores, and Karlsson scores at final follow-up. Ankle range of motion was not affected by lateral ankle reconstruction. The talar tilt was significantly reduced from a preoperative mean of 14.1 ñ 4.2ø to 3.4 ñ 1.3ø postoperatively (P <.001), and the anterior drawer was significantly reduced from a preoperative mean of 13.8 ñ 3.4 mm to 3.6 ñ 1.5 mm after lateral ankle ligamentous reconstruction (P <.001). Conclusions: AHPLT transfer to reconstruct the lateral ligament resulted in a high percentage of successful results, with excellent ankle stability and not affected of ankle motion.

Methods: Eight matched pairs of human cadaveric lower-extremities were measured intact, then following simulated syndesmosis injury by cutting the anterior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), the distal 15ÿcm of the interosseous membrane (IO), and the deltoid ligament. Thereafter, the syndesmotic injury was treated by suture-button fixation or ligament reconstruction. The semitendinosus tendon was harvested as a graft. Biomechanical testing was performed after the surgical fixation. The foot underwent rotation from neutral position to an external rotation at a rate of 5ø/s to 12.5ÿNm. The three-dimensional syndesmotic diastasis readings, final rotation torque, and rotational angle were recorded. Results: No difference was found in fibular displacements between two groups. Moreover, no significant difference was found in final rotation torque (11.95 ñ 1.03 VS 11.66 ñ 1.18ÿNm, P = 0.62) and rotation angle (43.61ø ñ 14.77ø VS 40.93ø ñ 10.94ø, P = 0.56) in the suture-button group and ligament reconstruction group. Conclusion: The stability of the suture-button fixation was equivalent to ligament reconstruction using semitendinosus tendon autograft in treatment of syndesmotic injury as determined with biomechanical testing. However, this study does not prove that one is advantageous over the other. ? 2018, SICOT aisbl.",Scopus,10.1007/s00264-018-3935-6,International Orthopaedics
1299,SC-682,Silva et al. (2019),2019,Does the cleat model interfere with ankle sprain risk factors in artificial grass?,"Background: The cleats-surface interaction has been described as a possible risk factor for lateral ankle sprain. However, their interaction is still unknown in individuals with chronic ankle instability. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of different soccer cleats on kinematic, kinetic and neuromuscular ankle variables on artificial grass in soccer players with and without chronic ankle instability. Methods: Eighty-two amateur athletes divided in two groups: 40 with chronic ankle instability and 42 without chronic ankle instability. All subjects performed 2 series of 6 consecutive crossover jumps with dominant foot, each one with one of the four models of cleats (Turf, Artificial grass, Hard and Firm ground). Cleat and group main effect and interactions of kinematic, kinetic and neuromuscular variables were analyzed according to factorial repeated measures ANOVA. Findings: No statistically significant cleat and group main effect and interactions were identified in kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic magnitude of the peroneal muscles. A main effect of the group was observed for peroneus longus activation time for TF model (p = 0.010). Interpretation: In soccer players, the contributor variables for ankle sprain were not influenced by the kind of soccer cleat used in a functional jump test on artificial grass. However, players with chronic ankle instability present delayed postural adjustments in peroneus longus with the TF model compared to players without chronic ankle instability. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2019.03.004,Clinical Biomechanics

(2019),2019,"Supplemental Fixation of Inner Graft Limbs in All-Inside, Quadrupled, Single-Tendon Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Graft Construct Yields Improved Biomechanical Properties","Purpose: To compare the time-zero load to failure of a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction graft construct with (supplemented) and without the incorporation of inner-limb whipstitch sutures (control) into a tibial suspensory fixation button. Methods: Eight matched pairs of peroneus longus tendons were prepared according to a quadrupled, all-inside ACL soft-tissue graft technique with 1 side serving as a control and the contralateral side supplemented. The constructs were biomechanically tested for strain in the inner and outer limbs during a preconditioning protocol, single-cycle load to failure, and elongation of the whole construct. Results: Ultimate load to failure was significantly higher in the supplemented group: 797.5 ñ 49.6 N (95% confidence interval [CI], 763.13-831.87 N) versus 719.6 ñ 69.6 N (95% CI, 671.38-767.82 N; P =.044). Less graft elongation at failure was observed in the supplemented group (3.1 ñ 1.5 mm; 95% CI, 2.07-4.17 mm) versus the control group (21.0 ñ 21.2 mm; 95% CI, 6.31-35.69 mm; P =.052). The number of grafts undergoing a 5-mm or greater change in length at failure was 1 of 8 in the supplemented group versus 5 of 8 in the control group (P =.038). Conclusions: Inner-limb supplemental tibial fixation results in higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation in a quadrupled, single-tendon, all-inside ACL reconstruction graft construct. Clinical Relevance: The weak point of a single-tendon, quadrupled, all-inside ACL graft construct is the tendon-to-tendon suturing to secure the inner limbs of the graft. Adding supplemental fixation by incorporating the sutures from the inner limb to the tibial suspensory fixation button leads to a higher time-zero load to failure and decreased graft elongation. ? 2019 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.arthro.2018.10.130,Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery
1301,SC-684,Nesch et al. (2019),2019,The effect of different running shoes on treadmill running mechanics and muscle activity assessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM),"Background: Differences in joint mechanics between running shoes are commonly assessed using discrete parameters, yet statistically significant differences in these parameters between shoes are often scarce with small effect sizes. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) has been suggested as suitable method for analyzing one-dimensional data such as kinematic, kinetic or muscle intensity time series. Research question: The purpose of this study was to determine differences in treadmill running mechanics between novel running shoes using SPM. Methods: Joint kinematics, muscle activity and ground reaction force were assessed in 19 rearfoot runners in their own shoes and in two test shoes during treadmill running (test shoe 1: 13 distinct rubber elements in the outer sole, springboard within EVA midsole with posterior elements shifted anteriorly by approximately 1.5 cm; test shoe 2: 17 distinct EVA elements with conventional heel geometry). Joint kinematics were measured using an inertial sensor system, and ground reaction force was measured using an instrumented treadmill. Results: SPM analysis with repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant reductions in the ankle angle and in tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, vastus medialis and lateralis muscle activity during weight acceptance and in peroneus longus muscle activity during early and late swing and in semitendinosus muscle activity during late swing for the test shoes. Significant differences in muscle activity were observed in the interval of the main activity of the respective muscle. SPM on individual data revealed statistically significant and relevant within-subject differences between conditions in kinematic, muscle activity and ground reaction force patterns. Significance: Inertial sensor systems and SPM may provide an efficient way of detecting changes in joint mechanics between running shoes within runners. Detecting within-subject differences in running mechanics between conditions not only requires statistical criteria but also criteria on the relevance of the magnitude of differences. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.01.013,Gait and Posture

We report the case of a complex injury involving the skin, lateral ankle ligaments, and peroneal tendons that were anatomically reconstructed. A 15-year-old girl was injured in an automobile accident resulting in extensive soft tissue defects and marked instability of her right ankle. The lower two-thirds of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) had segmental defects, and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) was completely torn, and both peroneal longus and brevis tendons were severely damaged. Initial debridement was performed on the day on injury. Two weeks after injury, the ATFL and CFL were reconstructed using a semitendinosus autograft and suture tape augmentation. Both peroneal tendons were reconstructed using a gracilis autograft. The skin defect (10 ? 10 cm) was covered with an anterolateral thigh flap. After removing a short leg cast at 3 weeks postoperatively, the patient started range of motion exercises without using any brace. Weightbearing was allowed at 4 weeks. At the 24-month follow-up examination, she had returned to her preoperative level of work and sports activities. ? The Author(s) 2019.",Scopus,10.1177/2473011418794677,Foot and Ankle Orthopaedics

(2019),2019,Comparative determination of the mechanical strength of a transplant from a tendon of a semitendinosus muscle for plastic surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament prepared in various ways (experimental study),"According to modern literature, a sufficient number of studies have been carried out to determine the mechanical strength of transplants from the tendon of the semitendinous and gracilis muscles, the autologous ligament of the patella, the broad fascia, peroneus longus tendon, each of which has unique characteristics, but at present, transplants prepared by original (new) methods are understudied. In the period from November 5 to December 17, 2018 we conducted an experimental study to determine the mechanical strength of a transplant from a tendon of a semitendinosus muscle taken from cadaveric material. The transplants were prepared by original and well-known (Graft-Link technique) methods. The experimental study was approved by the Ethics committee of Irkutsk Scientific Center of Surgery and Traumatology. The material for the study was prepared on the basis of the Irkutsk Regional Bureau of Forensic Medical Examination. After sampling the cadaveric material being studied, the main stages of the experimental study were carried out at the materials resistance department of the Irkutsk State Technical University. Studies of the mechanical properties of the transplant were carried out on a Shimadzu testing machine registered in the State Register of Measuring Instruments and approved for use in the Russian Federation. As a result of the study, we obtained the following data. The mechanical strength of the graft obtained from the tendon of the semitendinosus muscle in an original way is on average 607.8 ñ 101.2 N/mm. The mechanical strength of the graft obtained from the tendon of the semitendinosus muscle in a traditional manner (Graft-Link technique) is on average 351.8 ñ 133.0 N/ mm. ? 2021 Acta Biomedica Scientifica.

1305,SC-688,Kolasangiani et al. (2019),2019,Examination of postural control of body and the onset time of electrical activity of selected ankle muscles during single-leg landing in subjects with pronated and normal foot,"Introduction: This study aimed to explore foot pronation deformity on the postural control of the body and the onset time of the electrical activity of ankle muscles during landing. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 27 people with a pronated foot deformity and 27 normal people participated. The force plate was used to measure the postural control of the body. Surface electromyography signals were recorded in landing tests with electromyography, which synchronized with a force plate. To compare the performance of the two groups, we used multivariate analysis of variance. Results: The results indicated a statistically significant difference in the medial-lateral direction of differences between center of pressure and center of mass (COP-COM) between foot pronation (pronated) and normal group during landing (P<0.05). Regarding the variable of the onset time of the muscular electrical activity during landing, there was a statistically significant difference in medial gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, and peroneus longus muscles between the two groups (P<0.001). Conclusion: Foot pronation can be regarded as a factor affecting the biomechanics of landing by changing postural control of the body in the medial-lateral direction and the onset time of the electrical activity of medial gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, and peroneus longus muscles during landing movement. ? 2019 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

We report a case of complete CPN palsy following a knee dislocation treated with sural nerve grafting. Case: A 19-year-old man suffered a knee injury during a hurdle race. Diagnosis in a previous hospital revealed a complex ligament injury with CPN palsy. Ten weeks following injury, he was admitted to our institution because of a lack of neurological improvement. Considering the grade 0 results obtained in the manual muscle test (MMT) of tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor hallucis longus (EHL), the patient was diagnosed with complete neurotmesis of CPN, and surgery was performed. Operative findings revealed CPN discontinuity and an extended nerve defect length of 15 cm; therefore, sural nerve grafting was performed to repair the CPN injury. One year postoperatively, a grade 1 result from MMT of TA and EHL indicated a gradual neurological recovery. Three years postoperatively, MMT of TA and EHL showed significant improvement to grade 4+ and grade 4, respectively, and he could walk and jog without a knee brace. Discussion: Nerve graft length of >6 cm has shown limited success, and their efficacy for the treatment of CPN palsy following knee dislocations is controversial. However, young patients with complete CPN lesion are more likely to recover regardless of the length of nerve injury. Therefore, in such cases, nerve grafting can be considered as one of the treatments for complete CPN lesion following knee dislocations. ? 2019, Kobe University School of Medicine.

1309,SC-692,Sakti et al. (2019),2019,Anthropometric parameters measurement to predict 4-strand hamstring autograft size in single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction of South Sulawesi population,"Introduction: Among many available autograft options for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, hamstring tendon (HT) is the most popular graft. The ability to identify whether patient is at risk of inadequate HT autograft size prior to surgery is very important. Among some methods that have been done, anthropometric parameters are considered as an easy and cost effective method in predicting the size of HT autograft. In order to predict the length of semitendinosus tendon (ST), gracilis tendon (GT) and quadrupled HT graft diameter, a prospective study was conducted to determine the anthropometric parameters. Method: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), thigh circumference and thigh length of 60 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Using univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and simple logistic regression to evaluate the correlation of these anthropometric variables on the size of the graft obtained. Result: Average values for GT length (23.17 ñ 3.01 cm), ST length (24.93 ñ 2.85 cm), and 4-strand HT autograft diameter (7.36 ñ 0.66 mm). 83.33% total patients had graft diameter of 7 mm and more. Height and TLL correlate to GT length and quadruple HT autograft diameter, while thigh circumference correlates to ST length. Conclusion: Height and TLL can be predicting factor of GT length and quadruple HT autograft, while thigh circumference to ST length. Patients who are less than 155 cm in height and less than 76 cm in TLL are at risk of having 4-strand HT autograft diameter less than 7 mm. ? 2019 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.ijso.2019.11.005,International Journal of Surgery Open

Treatment of choice to PCL avulsion is vary from open surgery to arthroscopic surgery. PCL reconstruction with augmentation is a rare procedure to be performed in treating PCL avulsion case. This case reported and suggested an augmentation procedure in PCL avulsion case. This study aims is to evaluate the knee functional score using augmented PCL reconstruction on PCL avulsion using peroneus longus tendon. Presentation of case: We report 3 cases, 1 male and 2 females. The result of physical examination, X-ray examination, and MRI of the knee showed a PCL avulsion. Posterior drawer test showed grade 2 result. We performed an augmented PCL reconstruction on PCL avulsion using peroneus longus tendon. Knee scoring (IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, Tegner-Lysholm) collected pre-operative and 2 years post-operative. The result of knee scoring was significant improved in post-operative compare to before surgery. Conclusion: Augmented PCL reconstruction can be considered to be an alternative treatment of PCL avulsion because the procedure has excellent post-operative knee scoring result. ? 2019 The Author(s)",Scopus,10.1016/j.ijso.2019.09.003,International Journal of Surgery Open
1311,SC-694,Khajooei et al. (2019),2019,Muscle activity and strength in maximum isokinetic legpress testing with unstable footplates in active individuals,"BACKGROUND: Compensating unstable situations is an important functional capability to maintain joint stability, to compensate perturbations and to prevent (re-)injury. Therefore, reduced maximum strength and altered neuromuscular activity are expected by inducing instability to load test situations. Possible effects are not clear for induced instability during maximum legpress tests in healthy individuals. OBJECTIVE: To compare isokinetic legpress (LP) strength and lower-leg muscle activity using stable (S) and unstable (UN) footplates. METHODS: 16 males (28 ñ 4 yrs, 179 ñ 7 cm, 75 ñ 8 kg) performed five maximum LP in concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) mode. The maximum force (Fmax) and muscle activity were measured under conditions of S and UN footplates. The tested muscles comprised of the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL) and soleus (SOL) and their activity were quantified against the MVIC of each muscle respectively. RESULTS: The main finding revealed a significant reduction in Fmax under UN condition: 11.9 ñ 11.3% in CON and 23.5 ñ 47.8% in ECC (P< 0.05). Significant findings were also noted regarding the RMS derived values of the EMG of PL and TA. CONCLUSION: Unstable LP reduced force generation and increased the activity of PL and TA muscles which confirmed greater neuromuscular effort to compensate instability. This may have some implications for resistance testing and training coupled with an unstable base in the prevention and rehabilitation of injury to the neuromusculoskeletal system. ? 2019-IOS Press and the authors.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of this alternative autograft compared with autologous hamstring tendon (HT). Biomechanical testing of the graft options was performed and compared with the native ACL. Thirty-eight patients with acute ACL ruptures and grade III MCL injuries were treated with ACL reconstruction with a doubled autologous PLT or quadrupled autologous HT. Knee stability and function was evaluated clinically with the Lachman test and KT-2000 arthometer as well as subjectively with functional scores. Effects on the donor ankle were evaluated by biomechanical testing. The ultimate tensile strengths of doubled PLT and quadrupled HT were significantly higher than that of the native ACL and the ultimate tensile strength of doubled PLT was comparable with that of quadrupled HT. There were no significant differences in clinical or functional scores between the two groups. There were no significant differences in pre- and postoperative biomechanical testing of the donor ankle. PLT is a suitable alternative autograft for an ACL reconstruction in patients with a concomitant grade III MCL injury without a significant biomechanical disadvantage to the ankle donor site. ? ? 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",Scopus,10.1055/s-0038-1669951,Journal of Knee Surgery
1313,SC-696,Jelinek et al. (2019),2019,The effect of ankle support on lower limb kinematics during the Y-balance test using non-linear dynamic measures,"Background: According to dynamical systems theory, an increase in movement variability leads to greater adaptability, which may be related to the number of feedforward and feedback mechanisms associated with movement and postural control. Using Higuchi dimension (HDf) to measure complexity of the signal and Singular Value Decomposition Entropy (SvdEn) to measure the number of attributes required to describe the biosignal, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of kinesiology and strapping tape on center of pressure dynamics, myoelectric muscle activity, and joint angle during the Y balance test. Method: Forty-one participants between 18 and 34 years of age completed five trials of the Y balance test without tape, with strapping tape (ST), and with kinesiology tape (KT) in a cross-sectional study. The mean and standard errors were calculated for the center of pressure, joint angles, and muscle activities with no tape, ST, and KT. The results were analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA model (PA < 0.05) fit and followed by Tukey post hoc analysis from the R package with probability set at P < 0.05. Results: SvdEn indicated significantly decreased complexity in the anterior-posterior (p < 0.05) and internal-external rotation (p < 0.001) direction of the ankle, whilst HDf for both ST and KT identified a significant increase in ankle dynamics when compared to no tape (p < 0.0001) in the mediolateral direction. Taping also resulted in a significant difference in gastrocnemius muscle myoelectric muscle activity between ST and KT (p = 0.047). Conclusion: Complexity of ankle joint dynamics increased in the sagittal plane of movement with no significant changes in the possible number of physiological attributes. In contrast, the number of possible physiological attributes contributing to ankle movement was significantly lower in the frontal and transverse planes. Simply adhering tape to the skin is sufficient to influence neurological control and adaptability of movement. In addition, adaptation of ankle joint dynamics to retain postural stability during a Y Balance test is achieved differently depending on the direction of movement. ? ? 2019 Jelinek, Khalaf, Poilvet, Khandoker, Heale and Donnan.",Scopus,10.3389/fphys.2019.00935,Frontiers in Physiology
1314,SC-697,Hertel et al. (2019),2019,An updated model of chronic ankle instability,"Lateral ankle sprains (LASs) are among the most common injuries incurred during participation in sport and physical activity, and it is estimated that up to 40% of individuals who experience a first-time LAS will develop chronic ankle instability (CAI). Chronic ankle instability is characterized by a patient?s being more than 12 months removed from the initial LAS and exhibiting a propensity for recurrent ankle sprains, frequent episodes or perceptions of the ankle giving way, and persistent symptoms such as pain, swelling, limited motion, weakness, and diminished self-reported function. We present an updated model of CAI that aims to synthesize the current understanding of its causes and serves as a framework for the clinical assessment and rehabilitation of patients with LASs or CAI. Our goal was to describe how primary injury to the lateral ankle ligaments from an acute LAS may lead to a collection of interrelated pathomechanical, sensory-perceptual, and motor-behavioral impairments that influence a patient?s clinical outcome. With an underpinning of the biopsychosocial model, the concepts of self-organization and perception-action cycles derived from dynamic systems theory and a patient-specific neurosignature, stemming from the Melzack neuromatrix of pain theory, are used to describe these interrelationships. ? by the National Athletic Trainers?

Whereas the underlying cause of CAI is disputed, alterations in cortical motor functioning may contribute to the perceived dysfunction. Objective: To assess differences in cortical activity during single-limb stance among control, coper, and CAI groups. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Biomechanics laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 31 individuals (10 men, 21 women; age ¬ 22.3 6 2.4 years, height ¬ 169.6 6 9.7 cm, mass ¬ 70.6 6 11.6 kg), who were classified into control (n ¬ 13), coper (n ¬ 7), and CAI (n ¬ 11) groups participated in this study. Intervention(s): Participants performed single-limb stance on a force platform for 60 seconds while wearing a 24-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Oxyhemoglobin (HbO<inf>2</inf>) changes in the supplementary motor area (SMA), precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and superior parietal lobe were measured. Main Outcome Measure(s): Differences in averages and standard deviations of HbO<inf>2</inf> were assessed across groups. In the CAI group, correlations were analyzed between measures of cortical activation and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) scores. Results: No differences in average HbO<inf>2</inf> were present for any cortical areas. We observed differences in the standard deviation for the SMA across groups; specifically, the CAI group demonstrated greater variability than the control (r ¬ 0.395, P ¬ .02; 95% confidence interval ¬ 0.34, 0.67) and coper (r ¬ 0.38, P ¬ .04; 95% confidence interval ¬ 0.05, 0.69) groups. We demonstrated a strong correlation that was significant in the CAI group between the CAIT score and the average HbO<inf>2</inf> of the precentral gyrus (q ¬ 0.64, P ¬ .02) and a strong correlation that was not significant between the CAIT score and the average HbO<inf>2</inf> of the SMA (q ¬ 0.52, P ¬ .06). Conclusions: The CAI group displayed large differences in SMA cortical-activation variability. Greater variations in cortical activation may be necessary for similar static postural-control outcomes among individuals with CAI. Consequently, variations in cortical activation for these areas provide evidence for an altered neural mechanism of postural control among populations with CAI. ? by the National Athletic Trainers?

1316,SC-699,Burcal et al. (2019),2019,Cortical measures of motor planning and balance training in patients with chronic ankle instability,"Context: Motor planning, a prerequisite for goal-driven movement, is a complex process that occurs in the cortex. Evidence has suggested that motor planning is altered in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). We know balance training can improve balance, but we do not know if it also improves motor planning. Such changes in cortical activity can be assessed using electroencephalography. Objective: To evaluate changes in cortical measures of motor planning after balance training in patients with CAI. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Fifteen patients with CAI (age ¬ 20.80 6 2.37 years, height ¬ 169.47 6 7.95 cm, mass ¬ 70.45 6 19.25 kg). Intervention(s): A 4-week progression-based balance-training program. Main Outcome Measure(s): Motor planning was assessed via electroencephalography before a lateral-stepping task. We calculated event-related spectral perturbations in the h (4?8 Hz), a (8?12 Hz), b (14?25 Hz), and c (30?50 Hz) bands. The change in power (in decibels) was calculated in each band for the 500 milliseconds before the onset of the lateral-stepping movement. Additional outcomes were the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure(FAAM)?Activities of Daily Living and Sport subscales; the anterior-, posteromedial-, and posterolateral-reach directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test; and static balance. Patients completed 3 test sessions: baseline, 24- to 48-hour posttest, and 1-week posttest. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to assess changes over time. The a level was set at .05. Results: The FAAM?Activities of Daily Living subscale score was improved at both posttests (P, .05), and the FAAM-Sport subscale score was improved at the 1-week posttest (P ¬ .008). Balance was better in all 3 directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test at both posttest sessions (P, .001). After balance training, no differences were identified in cortical activity at either posttest session (P . .05). Conclusions: No improvements were identified in electroencephalography measures of motor planning during lateral stepping in patients with CAI.

1317,SC-700,Sun et al. (2019),2019,Anti-GAPDH autoantibody is associated with increased disease activity and intracranial pressure in systemic lupus erythematosus,"Objective. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune disease characterized by multiorgan involvement. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers. The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE. However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive. In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE. Methods. Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE. White blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (HB), platelet count (PLT), IgG, IgA, IgM, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), RF, anti-cardiolipin (Acl), ANA, AnuA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, ?2-GPI, urinalysis, and 24 h urine protein were measured by standard laboratory techniques. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index scores were evaluated accordingly. Results. The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (P = 0 0011). Elevated serum anti-GAPDH was correlated with increased SLEDAI-2K (P = 0 017), ESR, IgG, and IgM and associated with increased intracranial pressure and incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, but it was protective for seizure disorder incidence. Conclusions. Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity. It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice. ? ? 2019 Jingjing Sun et al.

1319,SC-702,Terada et al. (2019),2019,Nonlinear dynamic measures for evaluating postural control in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability,"This study aimed to compare time-to-boundary and sample entropy during a single-leg balance task between individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI), lateral ankle sprain copers, and healthy controls. Twenty-two participants with CAI, 20 lateral ankle sprain copers, and 24 healthy controls performed a single-leg balance task during an eyes-closed condition. Participants with CAI exhibited lower time-to-boundary values compared with lateral ankle sprain copers and healthy controls. However, we did not find differences in sample entropy variables between cohorts. A decrease in time-to-boundary values in participants with CAI indicated that CAI may constrain the ability of the sensorimotor system to maintain the center of pressure within the boundaries of the base of support. However, the regularity of the center of pressure velocity time series appears not to be altered in the CAI cohort in this study. ? 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/mc.2017-0001,Motor Control

Methods: A prospective clinical study was performed to compare 30 cases of single-tunnel ACL double-bundle anatomic reconstruction to 28 cases of double-tunnel ACL double-bundle anatomic reconstruction, with average follow-up of 36 months. All graft tendons were hamstring tendon autografts. Tunnel placements in all the cases were made anatomically. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction. Graft appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analyzed. Results: Tunnel placements were in the anatomic positions in both groups. On the lateral pivot-shift test performed at 36 months postoperatively, there was no significant difference between groups. Clinical results such as International Knee Documentation Committee score, Tegner activity scale, and range of motion showed no significant differences between the groups. The mean thickness of anteromedial graft was reduced by 10.3% and that of the posterolateral graft was reduced by 11.1% from the original graft thickness evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. No new meniscal tears were found either group; however, cartilage damage occurred in the double-tunnel group at 39.3%, and this rate was significantly higher than that in the single-tunnel group (10.0%). Conclusion: Single femoral, single tibial tunnel anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction has the same effectiveness as the double femoral, double tibial tunnel in restoring the knee's stability and functions.

1321,SC-704,Tsapatsoulis et al. (2019),2019,Opinion mining from social media short texts: Does collective intelligence beat deep learning?,"The era of big data has, among others, three characteristics: the huge amounts of data created every day and in every form by everyday people, artificial intelligence tools to mine information from those data and effective algorithms that allow this data mining in real or close to real time. On the other hand, opinion mining in social media is nowadays an important parameter of social media marketing. Digital media giants such as Google and Facebook developed and employed their own tools for that purpose. These tools are based on publicly available software libraries and tools such as Word2Vec (or Doc2Vec) and fasttext, which emphasize topic modeling and extract low-level features using deep learning approaches. So far, researchers have focused their efforts on opinion mining and especially on sentiment analysis of tweets. This trend reflects the availability of the Twitter API that simplifies automatic data (tweet) collection and testing of the proposed algorithms in real situations. However, if we are really interested in realistic opinion mining we should consider mining opinions from social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, which are far more popular among everyday people. The basic purpose of this paper is to compare various kinds of low-level features, including those extracted through deep learning, as in fasttext and Doc2Vec, and keywords suggested by the crowd, called crowd lexicon herein, through a crowdsourcing platform. The application target is sentiment analysis of tweets and Facebook comments on commercial products. We also compare several machine learning methods for the creation of sentiment analysis models and conclude that, even in the era of big data, allowing people to annotate (a small portion of) data would allow effective artificial intelligence tools to be developed using the learning by example paradigm. ? 2019 Tsapatsoulis and Djouvas.",Scopus,10.3389/frobt.2018.00138,Frontiers in Robotics and AI
1322,SC-705,Kayser et al. (2019),2019,Ultrasound anatomy of the normal stifle in the sheep,"Though the ovine stifle is commonly used as a model in research, there is no description of its anatomy at ultrasonography (US). The objective of this study was to provide reference US images of the ovine stifle that are relevant in musculoskeletal research. Four pairs of hindlimbs were scanned, whilst four other pairs were frozen and cut in different planes to compare gross anatomy to US scans. In another pair, the synovial compartments of the stifle were injected and scanned. This study demonstrated that US could be used to assess the ovine stifle. Several structures of clinical interest could be identified with cranial, lateral and medial approaches, such as (a) the tendons of m. quadriceps femoris, m. gluteobiceps, m. popliteus, (b) the common tendon of m. peroneus tertius?extensor longus digitorum?extensor digiti III proprius, (c) the patellar ligament, (d) the medial and lateral collateral ligaments, (e) the cranial horn and middle segment of medial and lateral meniscus, and (f) the synovial recesses. However, the caudal approach was not successful to identify caudal anatomical structures of the joint, due to the muscular mass, that is the caudal aspects of the articular surfaces of the femoral and tibial condyles, the caudal horns of the menisci and the supracondylar synovial recesses. In addition, US remained challenging to assess the internal structures such as cruciate ligaments andÿarticular surfaces.

METHODS: The levels of serum s-Eng were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 139 patients with APS, 44 patients with SLE but no APS, 37 patients with primary Sj”gren's syndrome (pSS), 23 patients with Bechet's disease (BD), 22 patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and 22 persistent anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) positive individuals without SLE or APS (simply aCL positive group) and 87 health controls (HC) without any auto-immune diseases. These APS patients included 64 primary APS patients and 75 APS patients secondary to SLE.The correlation between the clinical data, laboratory parameters, and serum s-Eng levels were analyzed.Independent samples t test, paired t test, Chi-square Test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's ?2 test were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: (1) The serum levels of s-Eng were significantly higher in the patients with APS whether primary or secondary to SLE than in the health controls and simply aCL positive group and the patients with other autoimmune diseases, including SLE, pSS, BD and SSc (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the serum s-Eng levels between simply aCL positive group and health controls [(5.17ñ2.00) mg/L vs. (5.04ñ1.11) mg/L, P>0.05]. (2) The best cut-off value for the diagnosis of APS was no less than 8.37 mg/L as mean ñ 3SD value, with the sensitivity at 0.772 and the specificity at 0.928. The Youden index was 0.700. These results indicated good validity of s-Eng as a diagnostic marker for APS. (3) The proportions of artery thrombosis and pathological pregnancy were higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than that in s-Eng-negative group (46/81 vs. 19/58, 29/65 vs. 10/44, respectively, all P<0.05). The levels of PLT were lower in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients (72.00?109/L vs. 119.00?109/L, P<0.001). (4) The proportions of the presence (93.83% vs. 37.93%, P<0.001) and titer (61.70 U/mL vs. 15.45 U/mL, P<0.001) of aCL were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group. The proportions of the presence (61.73% vs. 43.10%, P<0.05) and titer (33.48 U/mL vs.17.40 U/mL, P<0.05) of anti-?2-glycoprotein I antibody were both higher in the group of s-Eng-positive APS patients than in s-Eng-negative group too. CONCLUSION: s-Eng serum levels were significantly increased in the patients with APS, and it may play a role as acomplementary serological marker for the diagnosis and risk prediction of APS.",Scopus,0,Journal of Peking University (Health Sciences)
1324,SC-707,Miller et al. (2018),2018,Influence of Mirror Feedback and Ankle Joint Laxity on Dynamic Balance in Trained Ballet Dancers,"Enhanced understanding of dynamic postural stability (DPS) has the potential to curtail lower extremity injuries with important implications for athletic and scientific populations. The ability to stabilize following dynamic tasks such as jumping is dependent on several intrinsic factors, including ligamentous laxity, proprioception, and neuromuscular control. Ballet dancers are a unique group of aesthetic performers who frequently must perform unipedal balance during dynamic tasks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of mirror feedback and ankle laxity on dynamic balance and muscle activation in 15 trained ballet dancers during a hop-to-stabilization task with and without mirror feedback. Anteroposterior and inversion-eversion ankle laxity was measured with an arthrometer. Surface electromyography was then applied to the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles to record activity during the task in question. The main finding was that time-to-stabilization during the task was unaffected by mirror feedback (F = 0.105, p = 0.900; mirror = 3.31 ñ 0.10 s; no-mirror = 3.37 ñ 0.12 s). Greater antero-posterior laxity, however, negatively affected DPS with (r = 0.655, p = 0.008) and without the mirror (r = 0.858, p < 0.001). These results suggest that visual feedback does not affect performance during a DPS task; however, increased ankle laxity may influence balancing ability in ballet dancers. ? 2018 SAGE Publications.",Scopus,10.12678/1089-313X.22.4.184,Journal of Dance Medicine and Science

However, few research exists to investigate the relationship between the SHT and functional deficit in ankle. The objective of this study was to establish SHT as an evaluation criterion of functional deficits in ankle sprain. Twenty-seven subjects with a history of ankle sprain participated. The time taken to perform SHT in the uninjured and injured limbs was measured. The angular displacements of the ankle joint were measured using the 3D motion analysis system. The muscle activities of the peroneus longus muscle (PL), tibialis anterior muscle (TA), and the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles (GM, GL) were measured using surface EMG. The time of SHT in the injured limb (9.22ÿñÿ1.19ÿseconds) was significantly longer than that in the uninjured limb (8.71ÿñÿ0.99ÿseconds). The range of the ankle inversion/eversion and dorsal flexion/plantar flexion in the injured limb was significantly greater than that in the uninjured limb. The injured limb showed a significant decrease in PL, TA, and GM integral EMG during SHT. Ankle motion and muscle activity caused the decline in SHT time in patients with injured limb. ? 2018 The Authors.

(2018),2018,Predicting the graft diameter of the peroneus longus tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between various anthropometric parameters and the graft diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT). We retrospectively analyzed the data of 156 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with the PLT graft at our institution. Anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, gender, age, duration of injury, and preinjury activity levels, were recorded. t tests, correlation coefficients (Pearson r), and a multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter of the graft obtained. The mean PLT graft diameter was 8.3 mm, and 21 patients (13.5%) had a diameter less than 8 mm; 85 patients (54.5%) had a diameter between 8 and 9 mm, and 50 patients (32.0%) had a diameter greater than or equal to 9 mm. The correlation analysis showed that height (P < .001), weight (P < .001), and duration of injury (P = .012) were significantly related to graft diameter. On the basis of these 3 predictors, the following regression equation was obtained: Diameter = 2.28 + 0.028?height (cm) + 0.013?weight (kg) + 0.289?duration of injury (0 or 1). Patients who were short and shin were more likely to own smaller graft diameters (<8 mm), especially the one ruptured his or her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) over 3 months. Height, weight, and duration of injury were associated with the diameter of PLT. They are important preoperative information for surgeon about the size of PLT and can be used for alternative graft source planning and patient counseling. ? ? 2018 the Author(s).

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Thirty male collegiate soccer players participated: 15 with CAI were compared with 15 without CAI, matched by physical description. Intervention(s): In the diagonal single-leg rebound jump, participants stood on one leg on a 30-cm high box, hopped down diagonally (45ø) onto a force plate, and jumped vertically as high as possible with hands on their hips. Main outcome measures: Hip, knee, and ankle kinematics were acquired using a motion capture system. The activity of the gluteus medius, hip adductor, and lower leg muscles was recorded using electromyography. Jump performance was calculated using a force plate. Results: The CAI group had (i) decreased hip adduction, knee flexion, external rotation, and dorsiflexion angle; (ii) reduced hip adductor and peroneus muscle activations; and (iii) reduced jump height and short flight time. Conclusions: Male collegiate soccer players with CAI showed altered kinematics and muscle activities during a diagonal single-leg rebound jump; this may adversely affect rebound jump performance. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2018.08.003,Physical Therapy in Sport

Cross-exercise is a potential means to enhance neural excitability and improve recovery after ACLR. Hence our purpose, was to detail changes in brain activation, neural excitability and patient-reported outcomes in a cohort that completed an 8-week quadriceps-focused eccentric cross-exercise training program immediately following ACLR. Design: Case series. Setting: University. Particpants: Five patients participated in an 8-week (24-session) eccentric cross-exercise intervention after ACLR. Main outcome measures: Brain activation, neural activity and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated within 2 weeks post-ACLR and again at 10-weeks post-ACLR after the intervention. Each cross-exercise session consisted of 4 sets of 10 isokinetic eccentric contractions at 60 deg/sec with the noninvolved limb. Results: Following the intervention, patients demonstrated a facilitated spinal reflexive and muscle activity response from the motor cortex during a time when these measures are known to be depressed. Patients also demonstrated a reduce dependence on frontal cortex activity to generate quadriceps contractions. Further patients reported significant reductions in pain and symptoms and greater knee function. Conclusions: Eccentric cross-exercise after ACLR helps to facilitate positive adaptations in neural function and patient reported outcomes. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2018.08.010,Physical Therapy in Sport
1330,SC-713,Cao et al. (2018),2018,A new minimally invasive method for anatomic reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligaments with a Tightrope system,"Background: Several minimally invasive anatomic reconstruction techniques of the lateral ligaments have been introduced for the treatment of chronic lateral ankle instability. However, these strategies may not always follow accurate ligament anatomic attachments, especially in the construction of the fibular bone tunnels. Objectives: This study reported a new percutaneous technique for reconstruction of the ligaments of lateral ankle anatomically with a Tightrope system. Methods: From April 2016 to August 2016, 25 ankles of 24 patients with chronic ankle instability underwent our new percutaneous anatomic reconstruction of the lateral ligaments with a Tightrope system. The operation was performed through several small incisions. The fibular tunnel was made obliquely from the anteromedial side of lateral malleolus tip towards retro-malleolar cortex. The graft was fixed in the tunnel with the help of a Tightrope system. The calcaneal tunnel and talar tunnel were made as our previous method. The mean final follow-up was 12.2 months (range 10?14). Visual Analogue Scale for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score, and patients? subjective satisfaction were used to measure clinical outcomes. Preoperative and postoperative stress tests were performed and radiographic parameters were measured. Results: The Visual Analogue Scale decreased from 3.0 ñ 1.4 to 1.3 ñ 0.8ÿat the last follow-up (p < 0.01). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score was improved from 70.2 ñ 5.4 preoperatively to 92.4 ñ 5.3ÿat the final follow-up (p < 0.01). Radiologically, the mean anterior talar displacement was 13.1 ñ 2.7ÿmm preoperatively versus 5.6 ñ 1.3ÿmm at last follow-up (p < 0.01),and the mean varus talar tilt angle was 15.0ø ñ 2.4ø preoperatively versus 5.6ø ñ 1.9ø at the last follow-up (p < 0.01). Patients were satisfied (?excellent? or ?good?) in 23 ankles (92%). Two patients reported residual instability but less apprehension than the preoperative condition. Conclusions: Percutaneous anatomic reconstruction of the lateral ligaments of the ankle with a Tightrope system is an anatomic and effective procedure for the treatment of chronic lateral ankle instability. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1007/s00402-018-2955-4,Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery

1332,SC-715,Sakakibara et al. (2018),2018,Effect of Initial Graft Tension During Calcaneofibular Ligament Reconstruction on Ankle Kinematics and Laxity,"Background: Although a variety of surgical procedures for lateral ankle ligament reconstruction have frequently been reported, little is known about the effects of initial graft tension. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to investigate the effects of initial graft tension in calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) reconstruction. It was hypothesized that a high degree of initial graft tension would cause abnormal kinematics, laxity, and excessive graft tension. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Twelve cadaveric ankles were tested with a 6 degrees of freedom robotic system to apply passive plantarflexion-dorsiflexion motion and multidirectional loads. A repeated-measures experiment was designed with the CFL intact, CFL transected, and CFL reconstructed with 4 initial tension conditions (10, 30, 50, and 70 N). The 3-dimensional path and reconstructed graft tension were simultaneously recorded. Results: The calcaneus in CFL reconstruction with an initial tension of 70 N had the most eversion relative to the intact condition (mean eversion translations of 1.2, 3.0, 5.0, and 6.2 mm were observed at initial tensions of 10, 30, 50, and 70 N, respectively). The calcaneus also moved more posteriorly with external rotation as the initial tension increased. The reconstructed graft tension tended to increase as the initial tension increased. Conclusion: Ankle kinematic patterns and laxity after CFL reconstruction tended to become more abnormal as the initial graft tension increased at the time of surgery. Moreover, excessive initial graft tension caused excessive tension on the reconstructed graft. Clinical Relevance: This study indicated the importance of initial graft tension during CFL reconstruction. Overtensioning during CFL reconstruction should be avoided to imitate a normal ankle. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546518790254,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1333,SC-716,Armitano et al. (2018),2018,Coordination stability between the legs is reduced after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Background: The study was designed to examine coordination differences in walking between individuals with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared with healthy matched controls. Predictions from the extended Haken, Kelso, and Bunz coupled oscillator model were tested in these populations. Methods: Seventeen persons with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and 17 matched controls participated in the study. Sagittal plane angular knee displacement was recorded using electrogoniometers over the lateral right and left knee joints while participants walked at five walking speeds overground. Coordination pattern and stability between the knees were quantified by mean and standard deviation of relative phase, respectively. Findings: Mean relative phase was not influenced by walking speed or group. For both groups, coordination stability was maximal when individual's walked at their preferred gait speed. However, the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction group demonstrated reduced coordination stability compared with healthy controls across the five speeds. Multiple regression analyses found that people with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction who deviated more from antiphase coordination had decreased coordination stability. Interpretation: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction results in decreased coordination stability, indicative of reduced coupling strength between the legs. This change in gait coordination, which has not previously been found in the literature, may contribute to the increased rate of re-injury and degeneration in individuals who have had this reconstructive surgery. Application of a motor control model enhances our understanding of the influence of an injury on coordination during gait. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2018.07.003,Clinical Biomechanics

(2018),2018,"Personal digital bodyguards for e-security, e-learning and e-health: A prospective survey","The widespread availability of hand-held devices like tablets, phablets and smart phones, along with their new handwriting digitizing and their increased computing powers, enable these to process the graphomotor dimension and the lognormal trends of human handwriting. By exploiting such capacity, it becomes possible to extend these mobile devices into Personal Digital Bodyguards (PDBs). PDBs will be able to supplement people's sensitive data protection with signature verification, equipment use security with writer authentication and handwritten CAPTCHAs processing (e-security), and to enhance human-machine interaction performances through words spotting and handwriting recognition (e-recognition). For young children, these tools will turn into interactive toys helping them to learn and master their fine motor control and become better writers. For advanced students they will enable sophisticated systems for (e-learning) and (e-testing). Moreover, PDBs will also be able to provide the user with fine motor control monitoring, which can detect stress, aging and health problems (e-health). This paper presents a prospective survey of various projects dealing with these five e-fields of investigation, focussing on state of the art results and providing directions in research and development, under the theoretical umbrella of the Kinematic Theory of human movements and its Lognormality Principle. From a practical point of view, the concept of lognormality provides a fundamental common thread, an integrative psychophysical standpoint to track the graphomotor problems of signature verification, writer identification, handwriting generation, recognition and learning. ? 2018",Scopus,10.1016/j.patcog.2018.04.012,Pattern Recognition
1336,SC-719,Lord et al. (2018),2018,ACL graft compression: a method to allow reduced tunnel sizes in ACL reconstruction,"Purpose: A common problem during ACL reconstruction is asymmetry of proximal?distal graft diameter leading to tunnel upsizing and graft?tunnel mismatch. Compression downsizing provides a graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique and its effects on graft biomechanics and stability. It was hypothesised that compression downsizing would significantly reduce cross-sectional area (CSA); that no significant changes in graft biomechanics would occur; graft fixation stability would be improved. Method: Sixty-eight non-irradiated peroneus longus (PL) tendons were investigated. Twenty were halved and paired into ten four-strand grafts, 20 strands were compressed by 0.5?1ÿmm diameter and changes in CSA recorded using an alginate mould technique. The following properties were compared with 20 control strands: cyclic strain when loaded 70?220ÿN for 1000 cycles; stiffness; ultimate tensile load and stress; Young?s modulus. 24 PL tendons were quadrupled into grafts, 12 were compressed and all 24 were submerged in Ringer?s solution at 37ÿøC and the CSA recorded over 12ÿh. Twelve compressed and 12 control quadrupled grafts were mounted in porcine femurs, placed in Ringer?s solution for 12ÿh at 37ÿøC and graft displacement at the bone tunnel aperture recorded under cyclic loading. Results: Mean decreases in CSA of 31% under a stress of 471ÿkPa and 21% under a stress of 447ÿkPa were observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19% over 12ÿh compared to 2% for controls. No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability; mean cyclic displacements were 0.3ÿmm for both groups. Conclusions: No detrimental biomechanical effects of graft compression on allograft PL tendons were observed. Following compression, the grafts significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability between groups. Graft compression did not cause adverse mechanical effects in vitro. Smaller tunnels for compressed grafts reduce bone loss and ease anatomical placement. ? 2018, European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-018-4932-4,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"
1337,SC-720,Marsland et al. (2018),2018,Strength of Interference Screw Fixation to Cuboid vs Pulvertaft Weave to Peroneus Brevis for Tibialis Posterior Tendon Transfer for Foot Drop,"Background: Tibialis posterior (TP) tendon transfer is an effective treatment for foot drop. Currently, standard practice is to immobilize the ankle in a cast for 6 weeks nonweightbearing, risking postoperative stiffness. To assess whether early active dorsiflexion and protected weightbearing could be safe, the current study assessed tendon displacement under cyclic loading and load to failure, comparing the Pulvertaft weave (PW) to interference screw fixation (ISF) in a cadaveric foot model. Methods: Twenty-four cadaveric ankles had TP tendon transfer performed, 12 with the PW technique and 12 with ISF to the cuboid. The TP tendon was cycled 1000 times at 50 to 150 N and then loaded to failure in a materials testing machine. Tendon displacement at the insertion site was recorded every 100 cycles. An independent t test and 2-way analysis of variance were performed to compare techniques, with a significance level of P <.05. Results: Mean tendon displacement was similar in the PW group (2.9 ñ 2.5 mm [mean ñ SD]) compared with the ISF group (2.4 ñ 1.1 mm), P =.35. One specimen in the ISF group failed early by tendon pullout. None of the PW group failed early, although displacement of 8.9 mm was observed in 1 specimen. Mean load to failure was 419.1 ñ 82.6 N in the PW group in comparison to 499.4 ñ 109.6 N in the ISF group, P =.06. Conclusion: For TP tendon transfer, ISF and PW techniques were comparable, with no differences in tendon displacement after cyclical loading or load to failure. Greater variability was observed in the PW group, suggesting it may be a less reliable technique. Clinical Relevance: The results indicate that early active dorsiflexion and protected weightbearing may be safe for clinical evaluation, with potential benefits for the patient compared with cast immobilization. ? 2018, The Author(s) 2018.",Scopus,10.1177/1071100718762442,Foot and Ankle International

(2018),2018,How fatigue affects loads and balance ability of lower extremity joints from leaping to ground?,"BACKGROUND: Ability of muscle control will be decreased when human body is in fatigue. However, the loads and balance ability of lower extremity joints from leaping to ground after fatigue are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of fatigue on the kinematics, dynamics and dynamic and static balance of the lower extremity joints in athletes, so as to provide an important reference for preventing sports injuries. METHODS: Sixteen elite male volleyball players were induced to suffer from muscle fatigue using the closed kinetic chain action. Corresponding motion parameters of leaping dynamics, kinematics and plantar pressure center measured by Vicon infrared image acquisition system and three-dimensional force were collected.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The maximal hip flexion angle, the movement range and the range of motion of knee joint after fatigue were significantly lower than those before fatigue (P < 0.05). (2) The time to maximum knee flexion was decreased significantly after fatigue than that before fatigue, and the maximum ground reaction force was significantly increased after fatigue (P < 0.05). (3) The dynamic and static balance in the center of pressure offset radius, velocity and the cover area were significantly increased after fatigue (P < 0.05). (4) These results indicate that the subjects tend to take a relatively stiff action for leaping after fatigue, in order to maintain a stable posture as soon as possible. The balance ability is significantly reduced after fatigue. As a result, the impact force from leaping to ground cannot be effectively reduced, thereby increasing the risk of sports injuries. ? 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Maintaining the joint surface and axis are two main principles for the management of patients with tibial plateau fractures. Herein, we describe a patient with tibial plateau fracture of Schatzker type VI associated with complete ACL rupture. Although in a two-stage reconstruction surgery for treatment of its rupture seem to be accepted by most orthopaedic surgeons in cases of ACL injuries, we treated our patient with ORIF in a one-stage ACL reconstruction surgery. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient gained full range of motion and was functioning well. We reviewed the literature on performing ORIF in a one-stage ACL reconstruction for the treatment of tibial plateau fractures, which seemed to be a reasonable management approach that supported its use for the treatment of this patient. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.injury.2018.03.015,Injury
1341,SC-724,Blair et al. (2018),2018,Magnitude and variability of gait characteristics when walking on an irregular surface at different speeds,"Different modes of perturbations have been used to understand how individuals negotiate irregular surfaces, with a general notion that increased locomotion variability induces a positive training stimulus. Individuals tend to walk slower when initially exposed to such locomotion tasks, potentially influencing the magnitude and variability of biomechanical parameters. This study investigated theeffects of gait speed on lower extremity biomechanics when walking on an irregular (IS) and regular surface (RS). Twenty physically active males walked on a RS and IS at three different speeds (4 km/h, 5 km/h, 6 km/h). Lower extremity kinematics (300 Hz) and surface electromyography (3000 Hz) were recorded during the first 90 s of gait. Two-factor repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine surface and speed effects (p < 0.05). Gait speed influences walking biomechanics (kinematic and muscle activity parameters) the same irrespective of surface condition. As walking speed increased, sagittal shoe-surface angle, maximum ankle inversion, ankle abduction, knee and hip flexion increased during stance phase when walking on the IS and RS (p < 0.05). Increasing walking speed caused increased muscle activity of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, vastus medialis and biceps femoris (p < 0.05) on the IS and RS during the gait cycle. Increased gait, kinematic and muscle activity variability was reported at lower walking speed on both the IS and RS. Further, irrespective of gait speed, walking on an IS triggers postural adjustments, higher muscle activity and increased gait variability compared to RS walking. Our findings suggest the benefits of training on the irregular surface may be further enhanced at slower gait speeds. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.humov.2018.04.003,Human Movement Science

(2018),2018,A prospective study of coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with autogenous peroneus longus tendon for acromioclavicular joint dislocations,"Background: Anatomic coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction (ACCR) provides good outcomes for Rockwood type III and VI acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations. Various grafts have been used, but complications from graft harvesting are not uncommon. This study examined the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with AC joint dislocations repaired with the autogenous anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) to achieve ACCR. Methods: Patients with a Rockwood type III to V AC joint dislocation and magnetic resonance imaging of the disruption of the CC ligaments, as well as the AC capsule, were prospectively recruited. Patients received ACCR using an autogenous AHPLT graft and were evaluated clinically and radiographically preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Results: A total of 18 patients (mean age, 51 years) were prospectively recruited and received an autogenous AHPLT graft ACCR. Fifteen patients completed clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations at 12 months. The mean Constant score (CS) was 51 preoperatively and 93 at 12 months (P <.005). No significant difference was noted at 12 months between the CS of the injured and contralateral shoulder. The mean American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score at 12 months was 99, and this was not different from the value at any other time point. Loss of reduction occurred in 10 patients (56%), and tunnel widening was observed in 9 (50%), but neither was significantly correlated with functional outcome. Conclusion: Autogenous AHPLT appears to be a reliable tendon graft source for CC ligament reconstruction. ? 2017 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Scopus,10.1016/j.jse.2017.12.009,Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery
1343,SC-726,Needle et al. (2018),2018,The relationship between the sensory responses to ankle-joint loading and corticomotor excitability,"Purpose: Maintaining joint stability is dependent on the ability of the nervous system to sense and react to potentially injurious loads. In attempts to understand the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying joint stability, this afferent and efferent activity has been quantified separately at the cortical, segmental and peripheral levels using various electrophysiologic techniques in vivo. However, no studies have attempted to quantify sensory and motor activation at multiple levels of the nervous system in a single subset, to understand potential adaptations for optimizing joint stability. Materials and Methods: Muscle spindle afferent activity and sensory cortex event-related desynchronization were quantified during ankle-joint loading; and motor excitability was assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation and the Hoffmann reflex in a subset of 42 able-bodied individuals. Microneurography and electroencephalography were used to collect the muscle spindle afferent and sensory cortex activation, respectively, as joint load was applied using an ankle arthrometer. Separately, motor-evoked potentials were obtained from the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) using transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex, and compared to the reflexive responses evoked via sciatic nerve electrical stimulation. Results: Correlation coefficients revealed significant correlations between the motor threshold of the soleus and early muscle spindle afferent activity (r = ?0.494) and early cortical event-related desynchronization (r = 0.470), as well as tibialis anterior motor-evoked potential size and late muscle spindle afferent activity (r = 0.499). Conclusions: The results of this study highlight the nervous system's capability to offset motor output based on the volume of sensory input at the segmental and cortical levels. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,10.1080/00207454.2017.1396219,International Journal of Neuroscience
1344,SC-727,Mueller et al. (2018),2018,Differences in neuromuscular activity of ankle stabilizing muscles during postural disturbances: A gender-specific analysis,"The purpose was to examine gender differences in ankle stabilizing muscle activation during postural disturbances. Seventeen participants (9 females: 27 ñ 2yrs., 1.69 ñ 0.1 m, 63 ñ 7 kg; 8 males: 29 ñ 2yrs., 1.81 ñ 0.1 m; 83 ñ 7 kg) were included in the study. After familiarization on a split-belt-treadmill, participants walked (1 m/s) while 15 right-sided perturbations were randomly applied 200 ms after initial heel contact. Muscle activity of M. tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) was recorded during unperturbed and perturbed walking. The root mean square (RMS; [%]) was analyzed within 200 ms after perturbation. Co-activation was quantified as ratio of antagonist (GM)/agonist (TA) EMG-RMS during unperturbed and perturbed walking. Time to onset was calculated (ms). Data were analyzed descriptively (mean ñ SD) followed by three-way-ANOVA (gender/condition/muscle; à = 0.05). Perturbed walking elicited higher EMG activity compared to normal walking for TA and PL in both genders (p < 0.000). RMS amplitude gender comparisons revealed an interaction between gender and condition (F = 4.6, p = 0.049) and, a triple interaction among gender, condition and muscle (F = 4.7, p = 0.02). Women presented significantly higher EMG-RMS [%] PL amplitude than men during perturbed walking (mean difference = 209.6%, 95% confidence interval = ?367.0 to ?52.2%, p < 0.000). Co-activation showed significant lower values for perturbed compared to normal walking (p < 0.000), without significant gender differences for both walking conditions. GM activated significantly earlier than TA and PL (p < 0.01) without significant differences between the muscle activation onsets of men and women (p = 0.7). The results reflect that activation strategies of the ankle encompassing muscles differ between genders. In provoked stumbling, higher PL EMG activity in women compared to men is present. Future studies should aim to elucidate if this specific behavior has any relationship with ankle injury occurrence between genders. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2018.01.023,Gait and Posture
1345,SC-728,Yim et al. (2018),2018,Correlation between mechanical properties of the ankle muscles and postural sway during the menstrual cycle,"Ankle and foot injuries are common among athletes and physically active individuals. The most common residual disability, ankle sprain, is characterized by instability along with postural sway. If the supporting structures around a joint become lax, posture stability and balance are also affected. Previous studies have examined muscle stiffness and elasticity and postural sway separately; however, the relationship between these factors is yet unknown. It is well known that the levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen, change in women over the phase of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between the mechanical properties of tissue and balance activity using a non-invasive digital palpation device to determine if they undergo any changes over the menstrual cycle in young women. Sixteen young women with regular menstrual cycles completed the study. Tone, stiffness, and elasticity of the ankle muscles (lateral gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, and tibialis anterior) were measured using a non-invasive digital palpation device. Postural sway was recorded while the participants performed balance tasks during ovulation and menstruation. Significantly greater posture sway characteristics and ankle muscle elasticity were found during ovulation than during menstruation; lower tone and stiffness of the ankle muscles were observed at ovulation (p < 0.05). Additionally, weak-to-strong relationships between ankle muscle mechanical properties and postural sway characteristics were found (p < 0.05). These results suggest the effect of estrogen on human connective tissues. We therefore postulate that estrogen increases joint and muscle laxity and affects posture stability according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. ? 2018 Tohoku University Medical Press.",Scopus,10.1620/tjem.244.201,Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine

(2018),2018,Use of three-dimensional finite element models of the lateral ankle ligaments to evaluate three surgical techniques,"Objective: To compare three surgical techniques for lateral ankle ligament reconstruction using finite element (FE) models. Methods: A three-dimensional FE model of the left foot of a healthy volunteer and lateral collateral ligament injury models were developed. Three tendons [one-half of the autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT), one-half of the peroneus brevis tendon (PBT), and an allogeneic tendon] were used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction. The ankle varus stress and anterior drawer tests were performed to compare the three surgical techniques. Results: The ankle varus stress test showed that the equivalent stresses of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) (84.00 MPa) and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) (27.01 MPa) were lower in allogeneic tendon reconstruction than in the other two techniques but similar to those of normal individuals (138.48 and 25.90 MPa, respectively). The anterior drawer test showed that the equivalent stresses of the ATFL and CFL in autologous PLT reconstruction (31.31 and 28.60 MPa, respectively) and PBT reconstruction (31.47 and 29.07 MPa, respectively) were lower than those in allogeneic tendon reconstruction (57.32 and 52.20 MPa, respectively). Conclusions: The allogeneic tendon reconstruction outcome was similar to normal individuals. Allogeneic tendon reconstruction may be superior for lateral ankle ligament reconstruction without considering its complications. ? 2017, ?

1347,SC-730,Li et al. (2018),2018,Does chronic ankle instability influence lower extremity muscle activation of females during landing?,"Much remains unclear about how chronic ankle instability (CAI) could affect knee muscle activations and interact with knee biomechanics. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the influence of CAI on the lower extremity muscle activation at the ankle and knee joints during landings on a tilted surface. A surface electromyography system and two force plates were used to collect lower extremity muscle activation of 21 young female individuals with CAI and 21 pair-matched controls during a double-leg landing with test limb landing on the tilted surface. In the pre-landing phase, compared to controls, CAI participants displayed a reduced ankle evertor activation that could place CAI at a high risk of giving way or sprain injury. In the landing phase, an increased tibialis anterior activation of CAI led to increased co-contraction of ankle muscles in the sagittal and frontal plane. A greater ankle muscle co-contraction could increase the ankle stability during landings but may adversely influence the knee muscle activations (e.g., a greater co-contraction ratio of quadriceps to hamstrings). Relevant training programs (e.g., increasing pre-landing peroneal activation, and optimizing activation ratio of quadriceps to hamstrings) may help individuals with CAI improving ankle stability and reduce atypical knee loading during landings. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2017.11.009,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology

However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0 ñ 3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Tunnel positions, which were confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomical positions. At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4 ñ 7.1 vs. 89.3. ñ 8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71 ñ 0.57 vs. 1.85 ñ 0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15 ñ 0.36 vs. 0.10 ñ 0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1 ñ 1.40 vs. 99.5 ñ 1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up. An AHPLT autograft may be a good alternative for all-inside ACL reconstruction with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity. ? 2018 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",Scopus,10.1055/s-0038-1627466,Journal of Knee Surgery

The purpose of this study was to compare revision rate and patient-reported outcomes following primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft versus a preoperatively planned hybrid autograft-allograft. At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with a double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring autograft (A) or a planned hybrid (H) graft (single-strand semitendinosus with nonirradiated peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up. From this collection of patients, a matched-pair comparison was made between groups, with patients matched by gender, age at the time of surgery, and follow-up time. Revision rate at follow-up was 8.4 and 2.4% in the A and H groups, respectively (p = 0.073). A total of 148 surveys were completed (83 A, 65 H), from which 36 matched pairs were formed. Within the matched pairs, average age at surgery did not differ significantly between groups (A: 35.7 years, H: 36.0 years, p = 0.23). Time to follow-up was 4.3 and 3.7 years in the A and H groups, respectively. Patients with a hybrid graft had significantly higher KOOS Quality of Life subscores (A 69.6, H 79.2, p = 0.028), subjective IKDC scores (A 72.6, H 79.7, p = 0.031), and SANE scores (A 83.2, H 91.4, p = 0.015) at follow-up. Otherwise, no significant differences were found in patient-reported outcome scores between groups. A preoperatively planned hybrid graft, with use of a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated allograft, should be considered as a viable alternative for primary ACLR in older patients. ?

(2018),2018,Biotensegrity and myofascial chains: A global approach to an integrated kinetic chain,"Human movement is a complex orchestration of events involving many different body systems. Understanding how these systems interact during musculoskeletal movements can directly inform a variety of research fields including: injury etiology, injury prevention and therapeutic exercise prescription. Traditionally scientists have examined human movement through a reductionist lens whereby movements are broken down and observed in isolation. The process of reductionism fails to capture the interconnected complexities and the dynamic interactions found within complex systems such as human movement. An emerging idea is that human movement may be better understood using a holistic philosophy. In this regard, the properties of a given system cannot be determined or explained by its components alone, rather, it is the complexity of the system as a whole, that determines how the individual component parts behave. This paper hypothesizes that human movement can be better understood through holism; and provides available observational evidence in musculoskeletal science, which help to frame human movement as a globally interconnected complex system. Central to this, is biotensegrity, a concept where the bones of the skeletal system are postulated to be held together by the resting muscle tone of numerous viscoelastic muscular chains in a tension dependent manner. The design of a biotensegrity system suggests that when human movement occurs, the entire musculoskeletal system constantly adjusts during this movement causing global patterns to occur. This idea further supported by recent anatomical evidence suggesting that the muscles of the human body can no longer by viewed as independent anatomical structures that simply connect one bone to another bone. Rather, the body consists of numerous muscles connected in series, and end to end, which span the entire musculoskeletal system, creating long polyarticular viscoelastic myofascial muscle chains. Although theoretical, the concept of the human body being connected by these muscular chains, within a biotensegrity design, could be a potential underpinning theory for analyzing human movement in a more holistic manner. Indeed, preliminary research has now used the concept of myofascial pathways to enhance musculoskeletal examination, and provides a vivid example of how range of motion at a peripheral joint, is dependent upon the positioning of the entire body, offering supportive evidence that the body's kinetic chain is globally interconnected. Theoretical models that introduce a complex systems approach should be welcomed by the movement science field in an attempt to help explain clinical questions that have been resistant to a linear model. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2017.11.008,Medical Hypotheses

Operative treatment is indicated for symptomatic tears, as nonsurgical treatments are associated with poor clinical outcomes. There is no consensus regarding optimal surgical interventions, with primary repair, tenodesis of the peroneus longus to brevis, deep flexor tendon transfers (ie, flexor halluces longus), and allograft reconstruction all described.

The effect of foot orthoses during gait has also been extensively investigated. However, their effect on neuromuscular control, especially during activities such as jumping, landing, or pivoting, is still unknown. This study investigated the effect of two different kinds of foot orthoses on lower limb?s muscle activity during single-leg landings. In all, 28ÿfemale athletes were randomly assigned to either prefabricated soft bedding foot orthoses or custom-made sensorimotor foot orthoses and investigated immediately and again after 12ÿweeks of wearing the orthoses. The activity of each muscle was normalized to the overall activity of all analyzed muscles. This enables us to obtain the influence of the corresponding muscle on motor control. Muscle activity was analyzed during the flight and stabilization phases of landing. The sensorimotor foot orthoses increased the influence of peroneus longus and semitendinosus muscles and decreased the influence of tibialis anterior muscle, predominantly during the stabilization phase. Soft bedding foot orthoses, on the other hand, increased the influence of vastus medialis and decreased the influence of tibialis anterior muscle, mainly during the flight phase. Furthermore, motor control was altered during the flight and stabilization phases after long-term use, independently of the foot orthoses worn. In conclusion, sensorimotor foot orthoses may provide afferent feedback differently to soft bedding foot orthoses. Future clinical studies should investigate whether foot orthoses have positive effects on knee pain and the potential to reduce overload knee injuries during sports activities. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Scopus,10.1007/s12662-017-0474-z,German Journal of Exercise and Sport Research

Methods Eight patients underwent surgical reconstruction with a minimally invasive technique and tendon graft augmentation with ipsilateral semitendinosus tendon for chronic Achilles tendon rupture (more than 30 days after the injury and a gap of >6 cm). Patients were evaluated at a minimum follow-up of 24 months after the surgery through the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), the Achilles TendonTotal Rupture Scores (ATRS), the Endurance test, the calf circumference of the operated limb, and the contralateral and the eventual return to sports activity performed before the trauma. Results The mean age at surgery was 50.5 years. Five men and three women underwent the surgery. The average AOFAS was 92, mean Endurance test was 28.1, and the average ATRSwas 87. All patients returned to their daily activities, and six out of eight patients have returned to sports activities prior to the accident (two football players, three runners, one tennis player) at a mean of 7.0 (range: 6.7-7.2) months after the surgery. No patient reported complications or reruptures. Conclusion Our study confirms encouraging results for the treatment of Achilles tendon rupture with a minimally invasive technique with semitendinosus graft augmentation. The technique can be considered safe and allows patients to return to their sports activity.

Objective: To determine prospectively whether baseline hip-abductor strength predicts future noncontact lateral ankle sprains in competitive male soccer players. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Athletic training facilities and various athletic fields. Patients or Other Participants: Two hundred ten competitive male soccer players. Main Outcome Measure(s): Before the start of the sport season, isometric hip-abductor strength was measured bilaterally using a handheld dynamometer. Any previous history of ankle sprain, body mass index, age, height, and weight were documented. During the sport season (30 weeks), ankle injury status was recorded by team medical providers. Injured athletes were further classified based on the mechanism of injury. Only data from injured athletes who sustained noncontact lateral ankle sprains were used for analysis. Postseason, logistic regression was used to determine whether baseline hip strength predicted future noncontact lateral ankle sprains. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed for hip strength to determine the cutoff value for distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk outcomes. Results: A total of 25 noncontact lateral ankle sprains were confirmed, for an overall annual incidence of 11.9%. Baseline hip-abductor strength was lower in injured players than in uninjured players (P ¬ .008). Logistic regression indicated that impaired hip-abductor strength increased the future injury risk (odds ratio ¬ 1.10 [95% confidence interval ¬ 1.02, 1.18], P ¬ .010). The strength cutoff to define high risk was 33.8% body weight, as determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. For athletes classified as high risk, the probability of injury increased from 11.9% to 26.7%. Conclusions: Reduced isometric hip-abductor strength predisposed competitive male soccer players to noncontact lateral ankle sprains. ? by the National Athletic Trainers?

1358,SC-741,Domnick et al. (2017),2017,Kinematics of Different Components of the Posterolateral Corner of the Knee in the Lateral Collateral Ligament-intact State: A Human Cadaveric Study,"Purpose To determine the static stabilizing effects of different anatomical structures of the posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee in the lateral collateral ligament (LCL)-intact state. Methods Thirteen fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees were dissected and tested using an industrial robot with an optical tracking system. Kinematics were determined for 134 N anterior/posterior loads, 10 N m valgus/varus loads, and 5 N m internal/external rotatory loads in 0ø, 20ø, 30ø, 60ø, and 90ø of knee flexion. The PLC structures were dissected and consecutively released: (I) intact knee joint, (II) with released posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), (III) popliteomeniscal fibers, (IV) popliteofibular ligament, (V) arcuat and popliteotibial fibers, (VI) popliteus tendon (PLT), and (VII) LCL. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed with significance set at P <.05. Results After releasing the PCL, posterior tibial translation increased by 5.2 mm at 20ø to 9.4 mm at 90ø of joint flexion (P <.0001). A mild 1.8ø varus instability was measured in 0ø of flexion (P =.0017). After releasing the PLC structures, posterior tibial translation further increased by 2.9 mm at 20ø to 5.9 mm at 90ø of flexion (P <.05) and external rotation angle increased by 2.6ø at 0ø to 7.9ø at 90ø of flexion (P <.05, vs II). Varus stability did not decrease. Mild differences between states V and VI were found in 60ø and 90ø external rotation tests (2.1ø and 3.1ø; P <.05). Conclusions The connecting ligaments/fibers to the PLT act as a primary static stabilizer against external rotatory loads and a secondary stabilizer against posterior tibial loads (when PCL is injured). After releasing these structures, most static stabilizing function of the intact PLT is lost. The PLC has no varus-stabilizing function in the LCL-intact knee. Clinical Relevance Anatomy and function of these structures for primary and secondary joint stability should be considered for clinical diagnostics and when performing surgery in the PLC. ? 2017 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.arthro.2017.03.035,Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery

1360,SC-743,Lei et al. (2017),2017,Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral 1/2 peroneus longus tendon,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a commonly sport-induced knee joint injury that does serious harm to the knee stability. ACL reconstruction is a commonly used treatment method, but researches on 1/2 peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft are rarely reported. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes of removing the autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT under arthroscopy for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: 106 patients with complete ACL rupture in the Affiliated Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southwest Medical University from December 2010 to December 2014 were enrolled, and autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT was removed under arthroscopy for ACL reconstruction. At baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, the knee stability was evaluated manually through the anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test, and the knee function was evaluated by Tegner activity scale, Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test tests were negative in all patients. In terms of Tegner activity scale, Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores, there were significant differences at baseline and postoperative 3 months as compared with postoperative 6 months (P < 0.05); the scores at baseline and postoperative 3 months showed significant differences compared with 12 months postoperatively (P < 0.05); the scores showed no significant difference between 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P > 0.05). These results indicate that autologous ipsilateral 1/2 PLT is a good choice for ACL reconstruction under arthroscopy, achieving rapid and satisfactory functional recovery of the knee joint, which is not only minimally invasive and easy to operate, but also exhibits good therapeutic efficacy. ? 2017, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

(2017),2017,Electromechanical delay is a key to neuromuscular transmission,"BACKGROUND: With the development of sports medicine and rehabilitation medicine, electromechanical delay has been looked as an important index for evaluating the neuromuscular function at abroad. But the relevant research is little reported in China. OBJECTIVE: To review the literatures related to electromechanical delay published in recent years, and to explore the mechanisms, influential factors and the application status of the electromechanical delay, thereby providing reference for clinical practice and research. METHODS: A computer-based search of CNKI, WanFang and PubMed databases was performed for articles addressing electromechanical delay published from February 1979 to February 2017. The keywords were ?electromechanical delay, electro-mechanical response time? in English and Chinese, respectively. Repeated and old studies were excluded, and finally 44 eligible literatures were included, including 3 Chinese and 41 English articles. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The mechanisms of electromechanical delay have been clarified. The type of muscle fiber and the level of muscle fatigue can influence electromechanical delay, but the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Whether age and gender make effect on electromechanical delay is controversial. Electromechanical delay is not only used for evaluating the athletes? ability to reaction, but also wildly used to investigate the mechanism of various sports injuries and evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation. ? 2017, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

1362,SC-745,Halstead et al. (2017),2017,Development and reliability of a preliminary foot osteoarthritis magnetic resonance imaging score,"Objective. Foot osteoarthritis (OA) is very common but underinvestigated musculoskeletal condition and there is little consensus as to common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features. The aim of this study was to develop a preliminary foot OA MRI score (FOAMRIS) and evaluate its reliability. Methods. This preliminary semiquantitative score included the hindfoot, midfoot, and metatarsophalangeal joints. Joints were scored for joint space narrowing (JSN; 0-3), osteophytes (0-3), joint effusion/synovitis, and bone cysts (present/absent). Erosions and bone marrow lesions (BML) were scored (0-3) and BML were evaluated adjacent to entheses and at sub-tendon sites (present/absent). Additionally, tenosynovitis (0-3) and midfoot ligament pathology (present/absent) were scored. Reliability was evaluated in 15 people with foot pain and MRI-detected OA using 3.0T MRI multisequence protocols, and assessed using ICC as an overall score and per anatomical site. Results. Intrareader agreement (ICC) was generally good to excellent across the foot in joint features (JSN 0.90, osteophytes 0.90, effusion/synovitis 0.46, cysts 0.87), bone features (BML 0.83, erosion 0.66, BML entheses 0.66, BML sub-tendon 0.60) and soft tissue features (tenosynovitis 0.83, ligaments 0.77). Interreader agreement was lower for joint features (JSN 0.43, osteophytes 0.27, effusion/synovitis 0.02, cysts 0.48), bone features (BML 0.68, erosion 0.00, BML entheses 0.34, BML sub-tendon 0.13), and soft tissue features (tenosynovitis 0.35, ligaments 0.33). Conclusion. This preliminary FOAMRIS demonstrated good intrareader reliability and fair interreader reliability when assessing the total feature scores. Further development is required in cohorts with a range of pathologies and to assess the psychometric measurement properties. ?

1363,SC-746,Jun Son et al. (2017),2017,"Movement strategies among groups of chronic ankle instability, coper, and control","Introduction Comprehensive evaluation of movement strategies during functional movement is a difficult undertaking. Because of this challenge, studied movements have been oversimplified. Furthermore, evaluating movement strategies at only a discrete time point(s) provide limited insight into how movement strategies may change or adapt in chronic ankle instability (CAI) patients. This study aimed to identify abnormal movement strategies in individuals with a history of ankle sprain injury during a sports maneuver compared with healthy controls. Methods Sixty-six participants, consisting of 22 CAI patients, 22 ankle sprain copers, and 22 healthy controls, participated in this study. Functional profiles of lower extremity kinematics, kinetics, and EMG activation from initial contact (0% of stance) to toe-off (100% of stance) were collected and analyzed during a jump landing/cutting task using a functional data analysis approach. Results Compared with copers, CAI patients displayed landing positions of less plantarflexion, less inversion, more knee flexion, more hip flexion, and less hip abduction during the first 25% of stance. However, restricted dorsiflexion angle was observed in both CAI patients and copers relative to controls during the midlanding to mid-side-cutting phase when the ankle and knee reached its peak range of motion (e.g., dorsiflexion and knee flexion). Reduced EMG activation of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial gastrocnemius, and gluteus medius may be due to altered kinematics that reduce muscular demands on the involved muscles. Conclusions CAI patients displayed altered movement strategies, perhaps in an attempt to avoid perceived positions of risk. Although sagittal joint positions seemed to increase the external torque on the knee and hip extensors, frontal joint positions appeared to reduce the muscular demands on evertor and hip abductor muscles. ? 2017 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1249/MSS.0000000000001255,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise
1364,SC-747,Lepley et al. (2017),2017,Eccentric Exercise to Enhance Neuromuscular Control,"Context: Neuromuscular alterations are a major causal factor of primary and secondary injuries. Though injury prevention programs have experienced some success, rates of injuries have not declined, and after injury, individuals often return to activity with functionality below clinical recommendations. Considering alternative therapies to the conventional concentric exercise approach, such as one that can target neuromuscular injury risk and postinjury alterations, may provide for more effective injury prevention and rehabilitation protocols. Evidence Acquisition: Peer-reviewed sources available on the Web of Science and MEDLINE databases from 2000 through 2016 were gathered using searches associated with the keywords eccentric exercise, injury prevention, and neuromuscular control. Hypothesis: Eccentric exercise will reduce injury risk by targeting specific neural and morphologic alterations that precipitate neuromuscular dysfunction. Study Design: Clinical review. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Results: Neuromuscular control is influenced by alterations in muscle morphology and neural activity. Eccentric exercise beneficially modifies several underlying factors of muscle morphology (fiber typing, cross-sectional area, working range, and pennation angle), and emerging evidence indicates that eccentric exercise is also beneficial to peripheral and central neural activity (alpha motorneuron recruitment/firing, sarcolemma activity, corticospinal excitability, and brain activation). Conclusion: There is mounting evidence that eccentric exercise is not only a therapeutic intervention influencing muscle morphology but also targets unique alterations in neuromuscular control, influencing injury risk. ? 2017, ? 2017 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/1941738117710913,Sports Health

The results were examined of 9 knees of 7 patients who underwent repair of extensor system ligament injury with peroneus longus tendon autograft. The injuries were of the quadriceps tendon only in 2 knees, quadriceps tendon+ medial retinaculum in 4 knees and patellar tendon in 3 knees. The ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon was harvested and repair was made to the ruptured quadriceps tendon, medial retinaculum and patellar tendon. Technically, the peroneus longus tendon was wrapped around the torn quadriceps tendon and closed with the fan-out technique. In tears of the patellar tendon, repair was applied by opening 2 parallel tunnels lengthwise on the patella, then the two ends of the tendon were passed through the separate tunnels in the patella. All the patients operated on for ruptures of the patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon and/or medial retinaculum, returned to their daily life without any support by the 6th month postoperatively.

(2017),2017,T2* Mapping of Peroneal Tendons Using Clinically Relevant Subregions in an Asymptomatic Population,"Background: Peroneal tendon evaluation is particularly demanding using current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques because of their curving path around the lateral malleolus. Quantifiable, objective data on the health of the peroneal tendons could be useful for improving diagnosis of tendon pathology and tracking post-treatment responses. The purpose of this study was to establish a method and normative T2-star (T2*) values for the peroneal tendons in a screened asymptomatic cohort using clinically reproducible subregions, providing a baseline for comparison with peroneal tendon pathology. Methods: Unilateral ankle scans were acquired for 26 asymptomatic volunteers with a 3-Tesla MRI system using a T2* mapping sequence in the axial and sagittal planes. The peroneus brevis and peroneus longus tendons were manually segmented and subregions were isolated in the proximity of the lateral malleolus. Summary statistics for T2* values were calculated. Results: The peroneus brevis tendon exhibited a mean T2* value of 12 ms and the peroneus longus tendon was 11 ms. Subregions distal to the lateral malleolus had significantly higher T2* values (P <.05) than the subregions proximal in both tendons, in both the axial and sagittal planes. Conclusion: Peroneal tendon regions distal to the inferior tip of the lateral malleolus had significantly higher T2* values than those regions proximal, which could be related to anatomical differences along the tendon. Clinical Relevance: This study provides a quantitative method and normative baseline T2* mapping values for comparison with symptomatic clinically compromised peroneal tendon patients. ? 2017, ?

1367,SC-750,Gui et al. (2017),2017,All Arthroscopic Remnant-Preserving Technique to Reconstruct the Lateral Ankle Ligament Complex,"Arthroscopic lateral ankle ligament reconstruction has been recently advocated. But this technique has not been popularized because of the technical complexity and potential iatrogenic injury. Because the talocalcaneal and calcaneofibular ligaments are extra-articular structures, how to efficiently view and address them is a difficult task. Limited dissection outside the capsule to form a working space is required, but aggressive dissection is harmful for tissue healing although it is helpful for visualization and instrumentation. Because almost the entire talar body is covered by articular cartilage, it is very difficult to safely make a bone tunnel without damaging the cartilage. The remnants of the lateral ankle ligament have proprioceptive sensors that are important for functional stability, but it is difficult to perform anatomical reconstruction arthroscopically while preserving them because of the narrow working space. Furthermore, how to properly tension the reconstructed ligaments in such a narrow working space is also a very difficult task. We have designed a technique that preserves the remnants of lateral ankle ligaments, and all of the above-mentioned problems have been successfully addressed. We have used this technique clinically, and only minor complications occurred. ? 2017 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Scopus,10.1016/j.eats.2016.11.013,Arthroscopy Techniques
1368,SC-751,Vap et al. (2017),2017,The role of the peripheral passive rotation stabilizers of the knee with intact collateral and cruciate ligaments: A biomechanical study,"Background: A subset of patients have clinical internal and/or external knee rotational instability despite no apparent injury to the cruciate or collateral ligaments. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of sequentially cutting the posterolateral, anterolateral, posteromedial, and anteromedial structures of the knee on rotational stability in the setting of intact cruciate and collateral ligaments. It was hypothesized that cutting of the iliotibial band (ITB), anterolateral ligament and lateral capsule (ALL/LC), posterior oblique ligament (POL), and posteromedial capsule (PMC) would significantly increase internal rotation, while sectioning of the anteromedial capsule (AMC) and the popliteus tendon and popliteofibular ligament (PLT/PFL) would lead to a significant increase in external knee rotation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten pairs (N ¬ 20) of cadaveric knees were assigned to 2 sequential cutting groups (group 1: posterolateral-toposteromedial [PL ? PM] and group 2: posteromedial-to-posterolateral [PM ? PL]). Specimens were subjected to applied 5-Núm internal and external rotation torques at knee flexion angles of 0ø, 30ø, 60ø, and 90ø while intact and after each cut state. Rotational changes were measured and compared with the intact and previous cut states. Results: Sectioning of the ITB significantly increased internal rotation at 60ø and 90ø by 5.4ø and 6.2_ in group 1 (PL ? PM) and 3.5ø and 3.8ø in group 2 (PM!PL). PLT/PFL complex sectioning significantly increased external rotation at 60ø and 90ø by 2.7ø and 2.9ø in group 1 (PL ? PM). At 60ø and 90ø in group 2 (PM ? PL), ALL/LC sectioning produced significant increases in internal rotation of 3.1ø and 3.5ø, respectively. In group 2 (PM ? PL), POL sectioning produced a significant increase in internal rotation of 2.0ø at 0ø. AMC sectioning significantly increased external rotation at 30ø to 90ø of flexion with a magnitude of change of <1ø in both groups 1 (PL ? PM) and 2 (PM ? PL). Conclusion: Collectively, the anterolateral corner structures provided primary internal rotation control of the knee from 60ø to 90ø of knee flexion in knees with intact cruciate and collateral ligaments. The ITB was the most significant primary stabilizer of internal rotation. The POL had a primary role for internal rotational stability at full extension. The PLT/PFL complex was a primary stabilizer for external rotation of the knee at 60ø and 90ø. Clinical Relevance: This study delineates the primary and secondary roles of the ITB, ALL/LC, POL, and PLT/PFL to rotatory stability of the knee and provides new information to understand knee rotational instabilities. ?

1369,SC-752,Lyle et al. (2017),2017,Musculotendon adaptations and preservation of spinal reflex pathways following agonist-to-antagonist tendon transfer,"Tendon transfer surgeries are performed to restore lost motor function, but outcomes are variable, particularly those involving agonist-to-antagonist muscles. Here, we evaluated the possibility that lack of proprioceptive feedback reorganization and musculotendon adaptations could influence outcomes. Plantaris-to-tibialis anterior tendon transfer along with resection of the distal third of the tibialis anterior muscle belly was performed in eight cats. Four cats had concurrent transection of the deep peroneal nerve. After 15?20ÿweeks, intermuscular length and force-dependent sensory feedback were examined between hindlimb muscles, and the integrity of the tendon-to-tendon connection and musculotendon adaptations were evaluated. Three of the transferred tendons tore. A common finding was the formation of new tendinous connections, which often inserted near the original location of insertion on the skeleton (e.g., connections from plantaris toward calcaneus and from tibialis anterior toward first metatarsal). The newly formed tissue connections are expected to compromise the mechanical action of the transferred muscle. We found no evidence of changes in intermuscular reflexes between transferred plantaris muscle and synergists/antagonists whether the tendon-to-tendon connection remained intact or tore, indicating no spinal reflex reorganization. We propose the lack of spinal reflex reorganization could contribute the transferred muscle not adopting the activation patterns of the host muscle. Taken together, these findings suggest that musculotendon plasticity and lack of spinal reflex circuitry reorganization could limit functional outcomes after tendon transfer surgery. Surgical planning and outcomes assessments after tendon transfer surgery should consider potential consequences of the transferred muscle's intermuscular spinal circuit actions. ? 2017 The Authors.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if athletes have an increased risk of lower extremity musculoskeletal injury after return to play from a concussion. Methods: Injury data were collected from 2006 to 2013 for men?s football and for women?s basketball, soccer and lacrosse at a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I university. Ninety cases of in-season concussion in 73 athletes (52 male, 21 female) with return to play at least 30ÿdays prior to the end of the season were identified. A period of up to 90ÿdays of in-season competition following return to play was reviewed for time-loss injury. The same period was studied in up to two control athletes who had no concussion within the prior year and were matched for sport, starting status and position. Results: Lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries occurred at a higher rate in the concussed athletes (45/90 or 50ÿ%) than in the non-concussed athletes (30/148 or 20ÿ%; Pÿ<ÿ0.01). The odds of sustaining a musculoskeletal injury were 3.39 times higher in the concussed athletes (95ÿ% confidence interval 1.90?6.05; Pÿ<ÿ0.01). Overall, the number ofÿdays lost because of injury was similar between concussed and non-concussed athletes (median 9 versus 15; Pÿ=ÿ0.41). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate a relationship between concussion and an increased risk of lower extremity musculoskeletal injury after return to play, and may have implications for current medical practice standards regarding evaluation and management of concussion injuries. ? 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Scopus,10.1007/s40279-016-0607-9,Sports Medicine
1371,SC-754,Cho et al. (2017),2017,Outcomes of the Modified Brostr”m Procedure Augmented With Suture-Tape for Ankle Instability in Patients With Generalized Ligamentous Laxity,"Background: Although recent biomechanical studies have reported mechanical superiority of augmented anterior talofibular ligament reconstruction using suture-tape, clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of suture-tape augmentation is still insufficient. This prospective study was performed to evaluate the outcomes of the modified Brostr”m procedure augmented with suture-tape for chronic ankle instability with generalized ligamentous laxity, which has been known to be a poor prognostic factor for anatomic ligament repair. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with generalized ligamentous laxity were followed for more than 2 years after the augmented modified Brostr”m procedures for chronic ankle instability. Generalized ligamentous laxity was defined as a Beighton score ò4 points. The clinical evaluation consisted of the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) score. Measurement of talar tilt angle and anterior talar translation was obtained from stress radiographs to evaluate mechanical ankle stability. Results: FAOS and FAAM scores had significantly improved from preoperative average 63.2 and 54.3 points to 90.6 and 89.5 points at final follow-up, respectively (P <.001). Talar tilt angle and anterior talar translation had significantly improved from preoperative average 16.2ø and 12.1 mm to 3.6ø and 4.2 mm at final follow-up, respectively (P <.001). Preoperative side-to-side comparison with stress radiographs was significantly different, but this returned to within nonstatistical differences at final follow-up, respectively (P =.105,.532). Although 6 patients sustained an ankle sprain after operation, only 1 patient (3.6%) showed a recurrence of subjective and mechanical instability. Conclusions: Suture-tape augmentation for the modified Brostr”m procedure appears to be an effective operative alternative for chronic ankle instability with generalized ligamentous laxity. As one of the methods to improve the clinical outcomes in patients with relative contraindications of the modified Brostr”m repair, this procedure provided reliable stability with the advantages of anatomic ligament repair through the augmentation using suture-tape.

1372,SC-755,Campayo-Piernas et al. (2017),2017,Role of vision in sighted and blind soccer players in adapting to an unstable balance task,"This study tested whether a compensatory hypothesis exists on postural control during standing unstable balance tasks comparing blind soccer players (n = 7) to sighted soccer players (n = 15) and sighted sedentary individuals (n = 6). All subjects performed a pre-test, a training of ten practice trials on a single day, and a post-test balance test. All tests were performed on an unstable surface placed on a force platform and under closed-eyes conditions, and a final test was performed with open eyes. Balance performance was assessed by resultant distance (RD) and the magnitude of mean velocity (MV) of the centre of pressure (CoP) displacement, and EMG signals from the gastrocnemius lateralis, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, and peroneus longus were measured with surface electromyography. Principal component analysis (PCA) on EMG muscular activation was used to assess EMG pattern differences during the balance tasks. All groups improved their performance, obtaining low scores for the closed-eyes condition balance task after the training period in RD, VM, and aids received to keep balance in the novel task, and no differences were found between groups or in interaction effects. Sighted individuals and the control group showed significantly lower RD and VM scores under open-eyes conditions than blind participants. As regards neuromuscular behaviour, three principal patterns explained 84.15% of the variability in the measured data. The theoretical improvement of the other senses caused by visual deprivation does not allow blind individuals to obtain better balance than sighted individuals under closed-eyes conditions, thereby reinforcing the prominent role of vision in integrating and processing the other sensory inputs. In addition, blind individuals seem to increase their muscular co-activation as a safety strategy, but this behaviour is not different to that shown by sighted people under closed-eyes conditions. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,10.1007/s00221-017-4885-8,Experimental Brain Research
1373,SC-756,Ludwig et al. (2017),2017,Differences in the dominant and non-dominant knee valgus angle in junior elite and amateur soccer players after unilateral landing,"More than 70% of all knee injuries in soccer occur in non-contact situations. It is known that increased lower limb dynamic knee valgus is associated with such situations. Little has been found out about differences in knee kinematics of the dominant (kicking) and non-dominant (supporting) leg during a single leg landing. A total of 114 male adolescent soccer players (age 14.6 ñ 1.1 years) from elite (N = 66) and amateur soccer clubs (N = 48) performed a single leg drop landing down from a box. For each leg, the two-dimensional dynamic knee valgus angle (DKVA) was calculated. Paired t-tests were used to statistically determine significant differences between dominant and non-dominant leg DKVA, and t-tests were calculated between the two performance groups. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were identified for the DKVA between the dominant and non-dominant leg for both amateur and elite players, showing a greater DKVA for the dominant leg. Group differences for the DKVA between amateur and elite players were not found, neither for the dominant, nor for the non-dominant leg. It can be concluded that the non-dominant leg showed more stable dynamics than the dominant leg during unilateral landing regardless of the player?s performance level. This could be due to adaptions to sport-specific requirements. Therefore, it is recommended that programs to prevent knee injuries among soccer players consider the dynamics of each leg individually. ? 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Scopus,10.3390/sports5010014,Sports
1374,SC-757,Park et al. (2017),2017,Donor Site Morbidity after Lateral Ankle Ligament Reconstruction Using the Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"Background: The anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) has been reported to be an effective autograft for ligament reconstruction with respect to strength and safety. However, there is little information regarding donor site morbidity after harvesting the AHPLT. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a study on the isokinetic evaluation of ankle plantar flexion and eversion after AHPLT harvesting. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical and radiographic results after lateral ankle ligament reconstruction using the AHPLT. We further investigated whether harvesting the AHPLT for lateral ankle ligament reconstruction decreases the strength of ankle plantar flexion and eversion. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Thirty consecutive patients (31 cases) were treated by anatomic lateral ligament reconstruction using the AHPLT. For the clinical assessment, visual analog scale (VAS), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), and Karlsson-Peterson scores were evaluated preoperatively and at the last follow-up. For the radiographic assessment, talar tilt angle and anterior talar displacement were measured preoperatively and at the last follow-up. The peak isokinetic torques for ankle plantar flexion at angular velocities of 30 and 120 deg/s and eversion at angular velocities of 30 and 60 deg/s were measured at a minimum of 1 year after surgery. Results: The mean VAS score improved significantly from 6.4 ñ 1.7 preoperatively to 1.6 ñ 1.5 at the last follow-up (P <.001). The mean respective AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores improved significantly from 57.2 ñ 12.8 and 66.9 ñ 13.6 preoperatively to 89.0 ñ 10.0 and 93.3 ñ 5.7 at the last follow-up (P <.001). The mean talar tilt angle improved significantly from 15.3ø ñ 6.2ø preoperatively to 3.4ø ñ 3.0ø at the last follow-up (P <.001), and the mean anterior talar displacement improved significantly from 10.2 ñ 3.3 mm preoperatively to 6.3 ñ 1.9 mm at the last follow-up (P <.001). No significant differences were observed between the uninvolved and involved legs in the mean peak torque for plantar flexion at angular speeds of 30 deg/s (P =.517) and 120 deg/s (P =.347) or for eversion at angular speeds of 30 deg/s (P =.913) and 60 deg/s (P =.983). Conclusion: Anatomic lateral ligament reconstruction using the AHPLT showed good clinical and radiographic results without a significant decrease in the peroneus longus strength. Lateral ligament reconstruction using the AHPLT may be a good surgical option for the treatment of chronic ankle instability. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546516675167,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1375,SC-758,Palmer et al. (2017),2017,A Biomechanical Comparison of Allograft Tendons for Ligament Reconstruction,"Background: Allograft tendons are frequently used for ligament reconstruction about the knee, but they entail availability and cost challenges. The identification of other tissues that demonstrate equivalent performance to preferred tendons would improve limitations. Hypothesis/Purpose: We compared the biomechanical properties of 4 soft tissue allograft tendons: tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), and semitendinosus (ST). We hypothesized that allograft properties would be similar when standardized by the looped diameter. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: This study consisted of 2 arms evaluating large and small looped-diameter grafts: experiment A consisted of TA, TP, and PL tendons (n = 47 each) with larger looped diameters of 9.0 to 9.5 mm, and experiment B consisted of TA, TP, PL, and ST tendons (n = 53 each) with smaller looped diameters of 7.0 to 7.5 mm. Each specimen underwent mechanical testing to measure the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile force (UTF), maximal elongation at failure, ultimate tensile stress (UTS), and ultimate tensile strain (UT). Results: Experiment A: No significant differences were noted among tendons for UTF, maximal elongation at failure, and UT. UTS was significantly higher for the PL (54 MPa) compared with the TA (44 MPa) and TP (43 MPa) tendons. E was significantly higher for the PL (501 MPa) compared with the TP (416 MPa) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TP and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the TA tendons for all outcomes. Experiment B: All groups exhibited a similar E. UTF was again highest in the PL tendons (2294 N) but was significantly different from only the ST tendons (1915 N). UT was significantly higher for the ST (0.22) compared with the TA (0.19) and TP (0.19) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TA, TP, and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the ST tendons. Conclusion: Compared with TA tendons, TP and PL tendons of a given looped diameter exhibited noninferior initial biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics. ST tendons were mostly similar to TA tendons but exhibited a significantly higher elongation/UT and smaller cross-sectional area. For smaller looped-diameter grafts, all tissues were noninferior to ST tendons. In contrast to previous findings, PL tendons proved to be equally strong. Clinical Relevance: The results of this study should encourage surgeons to use these soft tissue allografts interchangeably, which is important as the number of ligament reconstructions performed with allografts continues to rise. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546516671944,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1376,SC-759,Moatshe et al. (2017),2017,Multiple Ligament Reconstruction Femoral Tunnels,"Background: Knee dislocations often require multiple concurrent ligament reconstructions, which involve creating several tunnels in the distal femur. Therefore, the risk of tunnel convergence is increased because of the limited bone volume within the distal aspect of the femur. Purpose: To assess the risk of tunnel convergence and determine the optimal reconstruction tunnel orientations for multiple ligament reconstructions in the femur. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Three-dimensional knee models were developed from computed tomography scans of 21 patients. Medical image processing software was used to create tunnels for each of the primary ligamentous structures, replicating a surgical approach that would be used in multiple ligament reconstructions. Thereafter, the tunnel orientation was varied in surgically relevant directions to determine orientations that minimized the risk of tunnel convergence. The orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tunnels was held constant throughout the study, while the orientation of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL) tunnels was varied to avoid convergence. Results: A high risk of tunnel convergence was observed between the FCL and ACL tunnels when the FCL tunnel was aimed at 0ø in the axial and coronal planes. Aiming the FCL tunnel 35ø anteriorly minimized convergence with the ACL tunnel. No tunnel convergence was observed for the PLT tunnel aimed 35ø anteriorly and parallel to the FCL tunnel. To avoid convergence between the sMCL and PCL tunnels, the sMCL tunnels should be aimed 40ø proximally in the coronal plane and 20ø to 40ø anteriorly. During concomitant POL reconstruction, the sMCL should be aimed 40ø proximally and anteriorly and the POL 20ø proximally and anteriorly. The PLT and POL tunnels aimed at 0ø in both the coronal and axial planes had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. Conclusion: Femoral tunnel orientations during multiple ligament reconstructions need to be adjusted to avoid tunnel convergence. On the lateral side, aiming the FCL and PLT tunnels 35ø anteriorly eliminated convergence with the ACL tunnel. On the medial side, tunnel convergence was avoided by orienting the sMCL tunnel 40ø proximally and anteriorly and the POL tunnel 20ø proximally and anteriorly. The POL and PLT tunnels aimed at 0ø in the axial plane had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. Clinical Relevance: The risk of tunnel convergence with the ACL and PCL femoral tunnels can be reduced by adjusting the orientation of the FCL and PLT tunnels and the sMCL and POL tunnels, respectively. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546516673616,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1377,SC-760,Konishi et al. (2017),2017,TENS alleviates muscle weakness attributable to attenuation of IA afferents,"Quadriceps weakness is a notable problem following knee damage. Research has shown effectiveness of TENS in improving Quadriceps weakness associated with arthrogenic muscle inhibition. However, these studies were not focused upon short term delivery of TENS, nor did they examine the potential mechanism(s). The present study examined the effect of 25-30 s of TENS upon weakness induced temporarily by a prolonged vibration. Subjects performed eccentric MVCs under 2 conditions (TENS and no-TENS). First, MVC was measured at baseline. For the TENS condition, TENS was applied to each subject's knee joint during a second MVC measurement after vibration. For no-TENS condition, TENS was not applied during the 2nd MVC measurement. MVC between pre-and post-vibration stimulation were compared across the 2 conditions. The results showed that MVC and EMG of TENS-condition was larger than that of no-TENS condition. Our results suggest that TENS could partially restore à-motoneuron activation, despite the induced dysfunctional ?-loop. These results suggest that mechanisms independent of the ?-loop such as a direct facilitation of the QF à-motoneuron pool by a long latency spinal-reflex and/or supraspinal mechanisms appear more likely to be responsible. The findings provide further support for utilizing TENS, even when ?-loop dysfunction is present following joint damage.",Scopus,10.1055/s-0042-118183,International Journal of Sports Medicine

Patients Sixteen participants (9 males, 7 females) with quadriceps inhibition, as determined by 90% or lower in central activation ratio (CAR), participated. Main outcome measures Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) of the vastus medialis and quadriceps CAR and MVIC were measured before taping, and participants were randomly allocated to either KT (KT application with tension) or sham (non-elastic tape application without tension) group. H-reflexes were assessed immediately and 20ÿmin after tape was applied over the rectus femoris.

(2017),2017,Neuromuscular Control Mechanisms During Single-Leg Jump Landing in Subacute Ankle Sprain Patients: A Case Control Study,"Background Optimal neuromuscular control mechanisms are essential for preparing, maintaining, and restoring functional joint stability during jump landing and to prevent ankle injuries. In subacute ankle sprain patients, neither muscle activity nor kinematics during jump landing has previously been assessed. Objective To compare neuromuscular control mechanisms and kinematics between subacute ankle sprain patients and healthy persons before and during the initial contact phase of a 25-cm single-leg jump. Design Case-control study. Setting University hospital. Patients Fifteen patients with grade I or II acute ankle sprains were followed up after 4 weeks of conservative management not involving physical therapy. Methods Subjects performed alternately 3 single-leg forward jumps of 25 cm (toe-to-heel distance) barefoot. Their results were compared with the data of 15 healthy subjects. Main Outcome Measurements Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the musculus (m.) gastrocnemius lateralis, m. tibialis anterior, and m. peroneus longus as well as kinematics for ankle, knee, and hip joint were recorded for pre?initial contact (IC) phase, post?initial contact phase, and reflex-induced phase. Results The results showed that EMG activity of the 3 muscles did not differ between ankle sprain patients (n = 15) and healthy persons (n = 15) for any of the analyzed time intervals (all P >.05). However, during the pre-IC phase, ankle sprain patients presented less plantar flexion, as well as during the post-IC phase after jump landing, compared to healthy persons (P <.05). Conclusion Taken together, these kinematic alterations of the ankle joint can lead to neuromuscular control mechanism disturbances through which functional instability might arise.

1380,SC-763,Russell et al. (2017),2017,Baseline cartilage quality is associated with voxel-based T1? and T2 following ACL reconstruction: A multicenter pilot study,"In this multi-center study, voxel-based relaxometry (VBR), a novel technique to automatically quantify localized cartilage change, was used to investigate T<inf>1?</inf> and T<inf>2</inf> relaxation times of patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears at the time of injury and 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Sixty-four ACL-injured patients from three sites underwent bilateral 3T MR T<inf>1?</inf> and T<inf>2</inf> mapping; 56 patients returned 6 months after surgery. Cross-sectional and longitudinal VBR comparisons of relaxation times were calculated.

Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T<inf>1?</inf> times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T<inf>1?</inf> increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T<inf>1?</inf> and T<inf>2</inf> after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration.

1381,SC-764,Lee et al. (2017),2017,Flexor Hallucis Longus Tendon Transfer Fixation: A Biomechanical Analysis of the Effects of a Terminal Whipstitch and Bone Tunnel Length,"Introduction. Flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon transfer to the calcaneus is commonly used in the surgical treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. This study assesses the integrity of FHL tendon biotenodesis screw fixation with respect to 2 variables: incorporation of a terminal whipstitch and tunnel depth. Materials and methods. A total of 60 fresh-frozen cadaver FHL tendons and 28 calcanei were harvested for analysis in 4 sets of fixation constructs; 14 whipstitched tendons were compared against their nonwhipstitched paired tendon via pull-out strength load testing, and 16 tendon pairs were randomized for fixation in either a full-depth tunnel (bicortical) or a 25-mm partial tunnel (unicortical). All comparisons were carried out in native bone and synthetic models. Results. Whipstitched tendons demonstrated significantly stronger mean clinical load (253.68 vs 177.24 N, P =.008) and maximum load to failure (294.31N vs 194.57 N, P =.001) compared with the nonwhipstitched tendons in synthetic bone. There were no statistical differences in mean clinical load (200.96 vs 228.31 N, P =.63) and maximum load to failure (192.69 vs 217.74 N, P =.73) between full and partial tunnel groups. There were no significant differences found in trials carried out in cadaveric bone. Conclusion. Use of a terminal whipstitch achieves greater fixation strength in FHL tendon biotenodesis transfers. Complete and partial tunnel constructs are equivocal in their pull-out strength. Data produced in a homogeneous bone substitute model demonstrate the biomechanical superiority of the whipstitch as well as the noninferiority of the partial tunnel technique.

Methods: Achilles, quadriceps, semitendinosus + gracilis (STG), tibialis anterior (TA) and the peroneus longus (PL) were harvested from 30 donors. Group A contained 50 tendons without gamma irradiation. The groups were irradiated with a dose of 21ÿkGy (group B 50 tendons) and with a dose of 42ÿkGy (group C 50 tendons). The grafts were soaked in a radio-protectant solution and frozen at ?80ÿøC. Cyclic loading tests were performed followed by load to failure tests. Young modulus of elasticity, maximum force, strain at tensile strength and strain at rupture were calculated. Results: The Achilles tendons had significantly lower Young modulus than the TA (p = 0.0036) in group A. The Achilles showed significantly lower than PL (p = 0.000042) and TA (p = 0.00142) in group B and C. The quadriceps and the ST (p = 0.0037) provided poorer values than the TA (p = 0.0432) in group C. We found no difference in maximum loads among the tendons in group A. The maximum load of the Achilles and quadriceps showed better results than the PL (p = 0.0016), (p = 0.0018) and the STG (p = 0.0066), (p = 0.0019) in group C. The TA had similar results like the Achilles and quadriceps. Discussion and conclusions: The vulnerability of gamma irradiation of TA was less than Achilles and quadriceps tendons. ? 2016, SICOT aisbl.",Scopus,10.1007/s00264-016-3336-7,International Orthopaedics

(2017),2017,Commercial Separation Systems Designed for Preparation of Platelet-Rich Plasma Yield Differences in Cellular Composition,"Background: The role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of sport-related injuries is unclear, largely due to the heterogeneity of clinical results. This may relate to compositional differences in PRP from different separation systems. Questions/Purposes: This study aims to compare the composition of PRP produced with five different commercially available systems, focusing on cellular concentrations and pH. Methods: Seven donors (41 ñ 12ÿyears) provided blood for PRP preparation using five systems (Arthrex Angel, Emcyte Genesis CS, Arteriocyte Magellan, Harvest SmartPrep, and Biomet GPS III). Post processing, cellular composition was measured including platelets (PLT), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NE), and red blood cells (RBC), as well as pH. Results: Platelet concentration and capture efficiency were similar between systems, except the Angel 7% preparation had a greater concentration than Genesis CS (2310 ñ 524 vs. 1129 ñ 264ÿk/?L). WBC concentration was variable between systems; however, significant differences were only found between the Angel 2% and GPS III preparations (11.0 ñ 4.5, 27.3 ñ 7.1ÿk/?L). NE concentration was significantly lower in the Angel 2% and 7% preparations compared with GPS III (0.6 ñ 0.6 and 1.8 ñ 1.3ÿk/?L vs. 9.4 ñ 7.0ÿk/?L). RBC concentration was highest in SmartPrep (3.2 ñ 0.6ÿM/?L) and Genesis CS systems (3.1 ñ 0.6ÿM/?L) compared with all other systems (ó1.1 ñ 1.2ÿM/?L). Finally, pH was significantly lower with the SmartPrep system (6.95 ñ 0.06) compared with all others (ò7.26 ñ 0.06). Conclusion: Aside from platelet concentration and capture efficiency, significant compositional differences were identified between preparation systems. Caution should be employed when interpreting clinical results of studies utilizing PRP, as the role of compositional differences and their effect on outcome are unknown. Further study is necessary to determine the clinical significance of these differences. ? 2016, Hospital for Special Surgery.",Scopus,10.1007/s11420-016-9519-3,HSS Journal

(2017),2017,Short term storage stability at room temperature of two different platelet-rich plasma preparations from equine donors and potential impact on growth factor concentrations,"Background: The increasing interest in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) based therapies is as yet accompanied by inconsistent information regarding nearly all aspects of handling and application. Among these storage stability of processed platelet-rich products may be the basis for a more flexible application mode. The objective of this study was (1) to estimate the storage stability of growth factors platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) and transforming growth factor á1 (TGF-á1) in both, a single-step softspin centrifugation-based pure-PRP (P-PRP, ACP?), and a gravity filtration system-based leukocyte-rich-PRP (L-PRP, E-PET), over a six hours time span after preparation at room temperature and (2) to identify possible factors influencing these growth factor concentrations in an equine model. Results: Growth factor concentrations remained stable over the entire investigation period in L-PRP as well as P-PRP preparations revealing a mean of 3569 pg/ml PDGF-BB for E-PET and means of 1276 pg/ml PDGF-BB and 5086 pg/ml TGF-á1 for ACP?. Pearson correlations yielded no significant impact of whole blood platelet (PLT), white blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) counts on resulting cytokine values. In case of ACP? no significant dependencies between PLT, WBC and RBC counts of the processed platelet-rich product and resulting cytokine content occurred with exception of TGF-á1 concentrations showing a strong correlation with the WBC content. PDGF-BB content of E-PET preparations showed a strong positive correlation with PLT and a strong negative with WBC of these preparations but not with RBC. Conclusions: L-PRP ad modum E-PET and P-PRP ad modum ACP? are applicable over at least a six hours time span at room temperature without loss of growth factor content. Based on the results of this study factors influencing the resulting growth factor concentrations still remain questionable. Additional studies implicating a further standardization of preparation protocols are necessary to identify consistent impact on cytokine content after PRP processing. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s12917-016-0920-4,BMC Veterinary Research

1387,SC-770,Godara et al. (2017),2017,7.37 Surgical adhesion and its prevention,"Adhesion of freely moving tissues and organs due to surgical injury and trauma can be a serious postoperative complication. High rates of incidence due to surgical intervention, especially associated with abdominal procedures, have been reported. This chapter gives an introduction to the formation of adhesions, with particular focus on peritoneum, urinary and reproductive (female) systems, tendon, ligament, joint, and pericardium. A number of techniques, treatments, and materials have been proposed for the prevention/reduction of adhesion formation. Of these, barrier methods are considered the only effective method currently available. An overview of biomaterials currently used as barriers for postsurgical tissue adhesion is presented. Current clinical practice utilizes solid membranes/mechanical barriers, spray-on, and gel and liquid barriers. These barriers can be either resorbable, nonresorbable, or a combination of both. Complications of barrier films are examined, and design criteria for barrier membranes are presented. Adhesion formation can be beneficial in particular circumstances, such as for anchoring implants, and these uses are commented upon. Much advancement has been made in this area, thanks to the increasing knowledge and understanding regarding the events that control adhesion formation, but there is still a long way to go before an optimum solution to this problem is found. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/B978-0-08-100691-7.00098-7,0

Methods The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed of 26 Neer type II-b distal clavicle fracture surgically treated by coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with autogenous AHPLT in Ganyu District People's Hospital of Lianyungang from June 2012 to May 2015. Among the 26 cases, 16 males and 10 females, aged from 19-56 years (average 38.7 years). Fracture occurred in left side in 18 cases and in right side in 8 cases. Postoperative observations were done on fracture healing, shoulder and ankle-foot function recovery. Results For all the 26 cases, surgical incisions were healed well, and no infection, vascular and peroneal nerve injury and iatrogenic fracture occurred. Follow-up was carried out for 10-24 months with average of 15.3 months. All the fractures were healed within 12-20 weeks with an average of 14.6 weeks. One patient was found of losing the fracture reduction part during the follow-up process, and then got eventual healing by extending the limb brake time. Another patient was found of slight tendon sensation disorder with no significant effect on daily life and exercise, and the symptoms disappeared 6 months later. At the last follow-up, the Constant-Murley score was 92-100 with an average of 97.8 points. The ankle-hind foot score of American Society of Ankle and Orthopedics was excellent. Conclusion Reconstruction of coracoclavicular ligament with autogenous AHPLT is an effective treatment for Neer type II-b distal clavicle fracture with good safety and without negative effect on the ankle-foot function, and thus it is worthy of wider clinical use. ? 2017, People's Military Medical Press.

1392,SC-775,Rudy; Mustamsir et al. (2017),2017,Tensile strength comparison between peroneus longus and hamstring tendons: A biomechanical study,"Introduction Soft tissue injuries, particularly ligaments and tendons, are the most common injuries in sports, account for more than 50% of all injuries and often require orthopedic surgery. According to data in the general population, the incidence rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury was 1:3500. The treatment option of ACL injury cases include physical exercise and reconstruction surgery. Graft options for the ACL reconstruction include:autograft and allograft. One of the most popular autograft is hamstring. The use of hamstrings in ACL reconstruction still arguing among the expert. The choice of autograft that can be chosen as a new alternative is the peroneus longus tendon. Currently, there is very few biomechanical study on peroneus longus strength as an alternative choice of autograft in ACL reconstruction. The study to determine the tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon was conducted by the researcher as a preliminary study that could bring new perspective for future studies. Materials and methods This is an experimental research. Six human cadaveric specimens as research material. Each cadaver was treated by taking hamstring and peroneus from both lower limbs. The hamstring and peroneal tendons were then measured by applying the Hydraulic Servo Pulser tensile test apparatus. Data on tensile strength comparison between peroneal tendon and hamstring were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. Result From the measurement results, it is known that hamstring has lower average tensile strength value compared to peroneus without significant difference (p > 0.05). Conclusion The tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon, which is similar to that of hamstring, gives information that both have the same biomechanic properties. Peroneus longus should not be used as a first option in ACL reconstruction, but may be used as an alternative donor in cases involving multiple instability that require more tendon donors in the reconstruction. ? 2017 The Authors",Scopus,10.1016/j.ijso.2017.10.002,International Journal of Surgery Open

(2017),2017,Evolution of Tendon Transfer to Allograft Reconstruction in Foot and Ankle Surgery,"Over the past several years, tendon transfers have been used to help correct deformity in a variety of clinical situations. Commonly, transfers are often used for addressing diseased tendons, including the anterior tibialis tendon, the Achilles tendon, the peroneals or the posterior tibialis tendon. Although good clinical/functional outcomes have demonstrated after tendon transfers, there has been, increasing interest in using bulk allograft tendon tissue for reconstructing deficient soft tissues. Allograft tendons provide a more comparable size to the once healthy, native tendon and may potentially improve functional outcomes. In this over view, we will review the pathoanatomy of tendon transfers, common clinical applications of tendon transfers, perioperative considerations with regard to use of tendon allografts and tendon allograft techniques in foot and ankle surgery. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This applies to F- concentrations in the joint forming structures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the concentrations of F- in the spongy bone, cartilage, meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament, and infrapatellar fat pad taken from patients with osteoarthritis following primary knee surgery. The study group comprised 20 patients from north-western Poland undergoing primary knee joint arthroplasty: 15 women aged from 60 to 84 yr and 5 men aged from 57 to 82 yr. The concentrations of F- were determined by potentiometry in dried samples and the results were expressed per dry weight (dw). The levels of F- in examined structures ranged from 19.82 to 2223.15 mg/kg dw and the medians had the following descending order: spongy bone > cartilage > meniscus > infrapatellar fat pad > anterior cruciate ligament. Based on the results of the present study, we are of the opinion that the physiological level of F- in connective tissue elements in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty does not exceed 200 mg/kg dw. ? 2017, ISFR.",Scopus,0,Fluoride

(2017),2017,The relationship between joint stiffness and muscle activity in unstable ankles and copers,"Context: Rolling sensations at the ankle are common after injury and represent failure in neural regulation of joint stiffness. However, deficits after ankle injury are variable and strategies for optimizing stiffness may differ across patients. Objective: To determine if ankle stiffness and muscle activation differ between patients with varying history of ankle injury. Patients: Fifty-nine individuals were stratified into healthy (CON, n = 20), functionally unstable (UNS, n = 19), and coper (COP, n = 20) groups. Main Outcome Measures: A 20ø supination perturbation was applied to the ankle as position and torque were synchronized with activity of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and soleus. Subjects were tested with muscles relaxed, while maintaining 30% muscle activation, and while directed to react and resist the perturbation. Results: No group differences existed for joint stiffness (F = 0.07, P = .993); however, the UNS group had higher soleus and less tibialis anterior activation than the CON group during passive trials (P < .05). In addition, greater early tibialis anterior activation generally predicted higher stiffness in the CON group (P ó .03), but greater soleus activity improved stiffness in the UNS group (P = .03). Conclusion: Although previous injury does not affect the ability to stiffen the joint under laboratory conditions, strategies appear to differ. Generally, the COP has decreased muscle activation, whereas the UNS uses greater plantar-flexor activity. The results of this study suggest that clinicians should emphasize correct preparatory muscle activation to improve joint stiffness in injury-rehabilitation efforts. ? 2017 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2015-0061,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

Ankle inversion-eversion laxity is greater and dynamic postural control is less in women compared with men. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in postural sway and its effects on the neuromuscular activities of the ankle stabilizing muscles during the menstrual cycle in young women. Fourteen young women with regular menstrual cycles participated in this experiment. Postural sway and electromyographic signals of the lateral gastrocnemius, peroneus longus (PL), and tibialis anterior (TA) were recorded while the participants performed eight different balance tasks at ovulation and early follicular phase during one full menstrual cycle. Significantly greater postural sway in the two most difficult balance tasks was observed at ovulation compared to that in the early follicular phase (p < 0.001). A similar pattern was also observed in terms of PL activity, while TA activity was significantly greater in the most difficult balance task at ovulation. In addition, TA-PL co-contraction (TA/PL ratio) was significantly higher at ovulation compared with that in the follicular phase in the two most difficult balance tasks (p < 0.01). Young women could benefit from increased understanding of the varying neuromuscular activation patterns throughout the menstrual cycle. The results of this study suggest that health professionals should be aware of the physiological effects and the shifts in neuromuscular strategies in each menstrual cycle phase in order to prevent increased risk of lower extremity injury. ? 2016 Tohoku University Medical Press.",Scopus,10.1620/tjem.240.287,Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine

Methods A cross-sectional case-control study was undertaken. B-mode ultrasound imaging was performed to measure the resting CSA and circular perimeter of the muscles and connective tissue and the total area and ratio between the CSA of the peroneus longus and the peroneus brevis. The imaging was performed for 56 feet, 28 with LAS and 28 without LAS (the mean numbers ñ SD of total LAS, grade-I LAS and grade-II LAS were 4.1 ñ 3.6, 2.71 ñ 3.2, and 1.39 ñ 0.9, respectively). A univariate correlation analysis using Pearson (r) and the Kendall tau_b (ç<inf>B</inf>) coefficients was performed to evaluate the ultrasound imaging measurements (à = 0.05). Results Statistically significant differences (P <.05) were observed between the 2 groups, with a moderate negative correlation for the circular perimeter of the peroneus longus (P =.001; r = ?0.444) and a weak association for the CSA of the peroneus longus (P =.002; ç<inf>B</inf> = ? 0.349), the ratio between the CSA of the peroneus longus and the peroneus brevis (P =.008; ç<inf>B</inf> = ?0.293), and the circular perimeter of connective tissue (P =.013; ç<inf>B</inf> = ?0.277). Conclusions The peroneus longus CSA is reduced in participants with LAS compared with that in participants without LAS. The intraexaminer reliability of the ultrasonography protocol was excellent when quantifying the peroneus brevis and the peroneus longus muscle tissues and acceptable when quantifying connective tissue. ? 2016",Scopus,10.1016/j.jmpt.2016.09.001,Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics

(2016),2016,Association Between Concussion and Lower Extremity Injuries in Collegiate Athletes,"Background: Concussions have been associated with elevated musculoskeletal injury risk; however, the influence of unreported and unrecognized concussions has not been investigated. Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between concussion and lower extremity musculoskeletal injury rates across a diverse array of sports among collegiate student-athletes at the conclusion of their athletic career. The hypothesis was that there will be a positive association between athletes who reported a history of concussions and higher rates of lower extremity injuries. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Methods: Student-athletes (N = 335; 62.1% women; mean age, 21.2 ñ 1.4 years) from 13 sports completed a reliable injury history questionnaire. Respondents indicated the total number of reported, unreported, and potentially unrecognized concussions as well as lower extremity injuries including ankle sprains, knee injuries, and muscle strains. Chi-square analyses were performed to identify the association between concussion and lower extremity injuries. Results: There were significant associations between concussion and lateral ankle sprain (P = 0.012), knee injury (P = 0.002), and lower extremity muscle strain (P = 0.031). There were also significant associations between reported concussions and knee injury (P = 0.003), unreported concussions and knee injury (P = 0.002), and unrecognized concussions and lateral ankle sprain (P = 0.001) and lower extremity muscle strains (P = 0.006), with odds ratios ranging from 1.6 to 2.9. Conclusion: There was a positive association between concussion history and lower extremity injuries (odds ratios, 1.6-2.9 elevated risk) among student-athletes at the conclusion of their intercollegiate athletic careers.

1402,SC-785,Donath et al. (2016),2016,Leg and trunk muscle coordination and postural sway during increasingly difficult standing balance tasks in young and older adults,"Ageing impairs body balance and increases older adults' fall risk. Balance training can improve intrinsic fall risk factors. However, age comparisons of muscle activity responses during balance tasks are lacking. This study investigated relative muscle activity, muscle coordination and postural sway during various recommended static balance training tasks. Muscle activity (%MVC), amplitude ratios (AR) and co-activity (CAI) were determined during standing tasks for 30 s (1: double limb stance on a foam surface, eyes open; 2: double limb stance on firm ground, eyes closed; 3: double limb stance, feet in step position on a foam surface, eyes open; 4: double limb stance, feet in step position on firm ground, eyes closed; 5: single limb stance on firm ground, eyes open) in 20 healthy young adults (24 ñ 2 y) and 20 older adults (73 ñ 6 y). Surface electromyography (SEMG) was applied (SENIAM guidelines) to ankle (tibialis anterior, soleus, medial gastrocnemius, peroneus longus) and thigh (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, semitendinosus) muscles (non-dominant leg). Electrodes over trunk (multifidus and internal oblique) muscles were applied bilaterally. Two- to six-fold higher levels of relative muscle activity were found in older adults for ankle (0.0002 < p < 0.001), thigh (0.0008 < p < 0.075) and trunk (0.001 < p < 0.036) muscles. Co-activation was elevated in young adults for the trunk (0.001 < p < 0.031) and in older adults for the ankle (0.009 < p < 0.03). Age-group differences were observed for muscle coordination patterns during all stance conditions at the ankle (0.06 < ?<inf>p</inf>2 < 0.28) and the trunk (0.14 < ?<inf>p</inf>2 < 0.23). Older adults had higher electrophysiological costs for all stance conditions. Muscle coordination showed inverse activity patterns at the ankle and trunk. Optimal balance and strength training programs should take into account age-specific alterations in muscle activity. ? 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ankle destabilization devices increase peroneus longus muscle activation during gait, which may increase eversion. Objective: To determine whether incorporating destabilization devices into a 4-week impairment-based rehabilitation program has beneficial effects on gait biomechanics and surface electromyography (sEMG) compared to impairment-based rehabilitation without destabilization devices in CAI patients. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Twenty-six CAI patients. Outcome measures: Patients completed baseline gait trials and were randomized into no device or device groups. Groups completed 4-weeks of rehabilitation with or without devices, and then completed post-intervention gait trials. Lower extremity sagittal and frontal plane kinematics and kinetics and sEMG activity were measured. Results: The device group increased dorsiflexion during mid-late stance and had lower normalized sEMG amplitude for the peroneus longus during early stance and mid-swing after rehabilitation. The no device group had less peroneus brevis sEMG activity during early stance after rehabilitation. Conclusion: Incorporating destabilization devices in a 4-week rehabilitation program was an effective method of improving dorsiflexion during the stance phase of gait. However, impairment-based rehabilitation, regardless of instability tool, was not effective at improving frontal plane motion. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2016.02.006,Physical Therapy in Sport

It often occurs during a jump landing or lateral motion, particularly when participants are fatigued. Objective: To compare muscle activation during a lateral hop prefatigue and postfatigue in individuals with or without chronic ankle instability (CAI). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Sports medicine research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 32 physically active participants volunteered for the study. Sixteen participants with CAI (8 men, 8 women; age = 20.50 ñ 2.00 years, height = 172.25 ñ 10.87 cm, mass = 69.13 ñ 13.31 kg) were matched with 16 control participants without CAI (8 men, 8 women; age = 22.00 ñ 3.30 years, height = 170.50 ñ 9.94 cm, mass = 69.63 ñ 14.82 kg) by age, height, mass, sex, and affected side. Intervention(s): Electromyography of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus was measured before and after a functional fatigue protocol. Main Outcome Measure(s): Activation of 4 lower extremity muscles was measured 200 milliseconds before and after landing from a lateral hop. Results: We observed no interactions. The group main effects for the peroneus longus demonstrated higher muscle activation in the CAI group (52.89% ñ 11.36%) than in the control group (41.12% ñ 11.36%) just before landing the lateral hop (F<inf>1,30</inf> = 8.58, P = .01), with a strong effect size (d = 1.01). The gluteus maximus also demonstrated higher muscle activation in the CAI group (45.55% 6 12.08%) than in the control group (36.81% ñ 12.08%) just before landing the lateral hop (F<inf>1,30</inf> = 4.19, P = .049), with a moderate effect size (d = 0.71). We observed a main effect for fatigue for the tibialis anterior, with postfatigue activation higher than prefatigue activation (F<inf>1,30</inf> = 7.45, P = .01). No differences were present between groups for the gluteus medius. Conclusions: Our results support the presence of a centralized feed-forward neuromuscular alteration in patients with CAI, not only in the ankle-joint muscles but also in the proximal hip muscles. These results may have implications for rehabilitation programs in these patients. ? by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.",Scopus,10.4085/1062-6050-51.10.01,Journal of Athletic Training

(2016),2016,Structural and material properties of human foot tendons,"Backgrounds The aim of this study was to assess the mechanical properties of the main balance tendons of the human foot in vitro reporting mechanical structural properties and mechanical material properties separately. Tendon structural properties are relevant for clinical applications, for example in orthopedic surgery to elect suitable replacements. Tendon material properties are important for engineering applications such as the development of refined constitutive models for computational simulation or in the design of synthetic materials. Methods One hundred uniaxial tensile tests were performed to obtain the mechanical response of the main intrinsic and extrinsic human foot tendons. The specimens were harvested from five frozen cadaver feet including: Extensor and Flexor tendons of all toes, Tibialis Anterior and Posterior tendons and Peroneus Brevis and Longus tendons. Findings Cross-sectional area, load and strain failure, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile stress are reported as a reference of foot tendon mechanical properties. Two different behaviors could be differentiated. Tibialis and Peroneus tendons exhibited higher values of strain failure compared to Flexor and Extensor tendons which had higher Young's modulus and ultimate tensile stress. Stress-strain tendon curves exhibited proportionality between regions. The initial strain, the toe region and the yield point corresponded to the 15, 30 and 70% of the strain failure respectively. Interpretation Mechanical properties of the lesser-studied human foot tendons are presented under the same test protocol for different engineering and clinical applications. The tendons that work at the inversion/eversion plane are more deformable at the same stress and strain rate than those that work at the flexion/extension plane. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to assess the dynamic postural stability and muscle strength in the hips and knees of females with and without PFP, and to verify the association between the postural stability and the muscle strength in the PFP group. Methods Two groups were tested: one with 25 PFP and one with 25 asymptomatic. Postural stability was evaluated during stepping up down tasks using a force platform to determine the center of pressure (COP) excursion and velocity. A handheld dynamometer was used to assess the muscles strength. The correlation analysis was conducted between the COP variables and the muscle strength. Results The PFP group demonstrated greater total and medial?lateral COP displacement (8887.7 ñ 761.7 vs. 8129.4 ñ 691.9 mm, P < 0.001; 32.3 ñ 5.5 vs. 21.7 ñ 2.7 mm, P < 0.001) and a higher total of medial?lateral COP velocity (22.2 ñ 5.2 vs. 17.0 ñ 1.6 P = 0.001). The PFP group showed weaknesses in all muscles (P < 0.05), and there was a good positive correlation between the anterior?posterior displacement and the velocity of the extensor hip muscle (r = 0.52, P < 0.01; r = 0.55, P < 0.001). Conclusions Subjects with PFP have frontal dynamic postural stability deficit and show an association between hip extensor and sagittal plane stability. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.knee.2016.04.013,Knee

Methods: Sixteen lower leg from eight fresh adult cadavers were used in this study and all the skeletal muscles were dissected. The muscle specimens were classified according to Lim?s classification. The specimens were then stained by further modified Sihler?s staining technique. Data were analyzed according to research results. Results: After the staining, we found four patterns of nerve distribution in human lower leg muscles: (1) Type 1: single nerve pattern in which the nerve branches into two either running parallel to each other or radiating in a spray pattern (such as the extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, fibularis brevis and flexor hallucis longus). (2) Type 2: double nerve pattern, one being proximal and the other being distal (such as the extensor digitorum longus, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus). (3) Type 3: multiple branch pattern (such as the tibialis anterior, fibularis longus, gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior and popliteus). Conclusion: Our modified Sihler?s staining method is useful for research of large muscles and intramuscular nerves in human. These findings might provide guidance for clinicians for muscle reconstruction surgery. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag France.",Scopus,10.1007/s00276-015-1601-x,Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy
1409,SC-792,Rinnovati et al. (2016),2016,The influence of environmental variables on platelet concentration in horse platelet-rich plasma,"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) commonly refers to blood products which contain a higher platelet (PLT) concentration as compared to normal plasma. Autologous PRP has been shown to be safe and effective in promoting the natural processes of soft tissue healing or reconstruction in humans and horses. Variability in PLT concentration has been observed in practice between PRP preparations from different patients or from the same individual under different conditions. A change in PLT concentration could modify PRP efficacy in routine applications. The aim of this study was to test the influence of environmental, individual and agonistic variables on the PLT concentration of PRP in horses. Six healthy Standardbred mares were exposed to six different variables with a one-week washout period between variables, and PRP was subsequently obtained from each horse. The variables were time of withdrawal during the day (morning/evening), hydration status (overhydration/dehydration) treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and training periods on a treadmill. The platelet concentration was significantly higher in horses treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (P= 0.03). The leukocyte concentration increased 2-9 fold with respect to whole blood in the PRP which was obtained after exposure to all the variable considered. Environmental variation in platelet concentration should be taken into consideration during PRP preparation. ? 2016 Rinnovati et al.",Scopus,10.1186/s13028-016-0226-3,Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica

(2016),2016,The association between MR T1? and T2 of cartilage and patient-reported outcomes after ACL injury and reconstruction,"Objective: To determine if cartilage T1? and T2 relaxation time measures after ACL injury and prior to reconstruction (baseline) are associated with patient-reported outcomes at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after surgery. Design: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1? and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1? or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1? or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. Results: Higher baseline SSD T1? posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1? pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year. Conclusion: T1? and T2 of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS after injury and both KOOS and Marx after reconstruction. Such associations may help clinicians stratify outcomes post-injury, and thus, improve patient management. ? 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.",Scopus,10.1016/j.joca.2016.01.985,Osteoarthritis and Cartilage
1411,SC-794,Piontek et al. (2016),2016,"Minimally invasive, endoscopic Achilles tendon reconstruction using semitendinosus and gracilis tendons with Endobutton stabilization","Background: Plantaris tendon, peronus brevis tendon and flexor hallucis longus tendon augmentation, commonly used in Achilles tendon rupture, often lead to weakening of injured foot and they require the immobilization after the surgery. It is essential to develop the technique, which gives no such limitation and allows for immediate functional improvement. Methods: We present our method of minimally invasive, endoscopic Achilles tendon reconstruction using semitendinosus and gracilis tendons with Endobutton stabilization. Results: Posterolateral and posteromedial portals were made approximately 3 cm above the posterosuperior part of the calcaneus to clean the area of the Achilles tendon endoscopically. Then the hamstrings are harvested and prepared for the ""Endobutton"" system. A midline incision of the skin is performed approximately 1 cm above the posterosuperior part of the calcaneus to approach to the posterosuperior part of the calcaneus. Then under fluoroscopy the calcaneus was drilled through using K-wire. The distal end of the graft equipped with an Endobutton loop was entered into the drilled tunnel in the calcaneus. Later, 8 consecutive skin incisions are performed. Proximal ends of the graft were brought out through the native Achilles tendon reaching medial and lateral skin incisions. The final step was to transfer and tie the graft ends through the most proximal skin incision. Conclusions: This minimally invasive, endoscopic technique allows reconstruction of the Achilles tendon using semitendinosus and gracilis tendons with Endobutton stabilization and can be used in so-called ""difficult"", resistant cases as a ""salvage procedure"". ? 2016 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1186/s12891-016-1099-3,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders

(2016),2016,Evaluation of the screw position and angle using a post-contoured plate in the open wedge high tibial osteotomy according to the correction degree and surgical technique,"Background The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the screw insertion angle and orientation with an anatomical plate that is post-contoured to the surface geometry of the proximal tibia after open wedge high tibial osteotomy. Methods From March 2012 to June 2014, 31 uni-planar and 38 bi-planar osteotomies were evaluated. Postoperative computed tomography data obtained after open wedge high tibial osteotomy using a locking plate were used for reconstruction of the 3 dimensional model with Mimics v.16.0 of the proximal tibia and locking plate. Measurement data were compared between 2 groups (gap lesser than or equal to 10 mm (Group 1) and gap greater than 10 mm(Group 2)). These data were also compared between the uniplanar (Group 3) and bi-planar (Group 4) osteotomy groups. Findings Dimensions of the medial proximal tibia of the sagittal plane, positions of the screw hole in the sagittal plane, and angles of screw insertion of all planes were not statistically different, regardless of the correction degree and operative technique. Additionally, angles of screw insertion were larger at the most anterior and posterior screw in the axial plane and most inferior screw showed smallest angle in the coronal plane. Interpretation Using a post-contoured plate, the position and angle of the screw insertion were not different in the direction of the lateral hinge, regardless of the correction degree and operative technique. This could imply that it could be used universally in the open wedge high tibial osteotomy. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Scopus,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2016.04.016,Clinical Biomechanics

Indications: Posterolateral rotational instabilities of the knee. Combined lesions of the PCL, the popliteus complex (PLT) and the posterolateral corner. Isolated PLT lesions lacking static stabilizing function. Contraindications: Neuromuscular disorders; knee deformities or fractures; severe posterolateral soft tissue damage. Surgical technique: Six arthroscopic portals are necessary. Using the posteromedial portal, resect dorsal septum with a shaver. Visualize the PCL, the lateral femoral condyle and the posterolateral recessus with the PLT. Dissect the popliteomeniscal fibers; retract PLT until sulcus popliteusÿis visualized. Drill a 6-mm tunnel anteriorly into the distal third of the sulcus popliteus. Visualize femoral footprint of the PLT and place an anatomical drill tunnel. Pull the popliteus bypass graft into the knee and fix with bioscrews. Fix the reconstructed PCL. In cases of additional LCL injury, reconstruct LCL with autologous graft. Postoperative management: Partial weight-bearing for 6ÿweeks, range of motion exercises, quadriceps-strengthening exercises on postoperative dayÿ1. Full extension allowed immediately with flexion limited to 20ø for 2ÿweeks, to 45ø for up to weekÿ4, and to 60ø up to weekÿ6. Use a PCL brace for 3ÿmonths, running and squatting exercises allowed after 3ÿmonths. Results: In the 35ÿpatients treated, no technique-related complications. After 1ÿyear, 12ÿpatients had a mean Lysholm Score of 88.6 (ñÿ8.7) points and a side-to-side difference in the posterior drawer test of 2.9 (ñÿ2.2) mm (preoperative 13.3 [ñÿ1.9] mm).

A total of 24 adult New Zealand white rabbits underwent a left femoral segmental bone defect creation. Twelve rabbits in group A underwent three-dimensional (3D) printed cage insertion, corticocancellous chips implantation, and Kirschner-wire (K-wire) fixation, while the other 12 rabbits in group B received bone chips implantation and K-wire fixation only. All rabbits received a one-week activity assessment and the initial image study at postoperative 1 week. The final image study was repeated at postoperative 12 or 24 weeks before the rabbit scarification procedure on schedule. After the animals were sacrificed, both femurs of all the rabbits were prepared for leg length ratios and 3-point bending tests. The rabbits in group A showed an increase of activities during the first week postoperatively and decreased anterior cortical disruptions in the postoperative image assessments. Additionally, higher leg length ratios and 3-point bending strengths demonstrated improved final bony ingrowths within the bone defects for rabbits in group A. In conclusion, through this bone graft converting technique, orthopedic surgeons can treat segmental bone defects by using bone chips but with imitate characters of structured cortical bone graft. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Scopus,10.3390/ijms17040595,International Journal of Molecular Sciences

(2016),2016,Medial patella-femoral ligament reconstruction using the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a combined procedure for recurrent patellar instability,"Background Medial patella-femoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) using hamstring tendon is the main procedure for recurrent patellar instability. The anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) has been proven to be a useful alternate to the hamstring tendon in knee ligament reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of MPFLR using the new graft. Methods Forty-five patients with recurrent patellar instability received MPFLR using the AHPLT. Tibial tubercle transfer and lateral release were also performed. Follow-ups were performed at 12 months and 24 months postoperatively, and computed tomography was performed immediately following the operation and at follow-up. The passive patella glide test was performed prior to surgery, during the operation, and at each follow-up point. Knee function was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively using the International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, Kujala, and Tegner rating scales. Results Forty patients were followed for 2 years and received complete serial computed tomography examinations and functional evaluations. The correction of the static patellar position remained through the follow-ups. Functional evaluations at 2 years revealed statistical significant improvement over preoperative status, with International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score, Lysholm score, Kujala score, and Tegner score. Conclusion AHPLT is a promising alternative graft for MPFLR, together with lateral release and tibial tubercle transfer, satisfactory static patellar position, and functional outcomes have been achieved in the treatment of recurrent patellar dislocation in adults.

(2016),2016,Radiographic identification of the primary structures of the ankle syndesmosis,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to quantitatively describe the locations of the syndesmotic ligaments and the tibiofibular articulating cartilage surfaces on standard radiographic views using reproducible radiographic landmarks and reference axes. Methods: Twelve non-paired ankles were dissected to identify the anterior?inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), posterior?inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL), interosseous tibiofibular ligament (ITFL), and the cartilage surfaces of the syndesmosis. Structures were marked with 2-mm radiopaque spheres prior to obtaining lateral and mortise radiographs. Measurements were performed by two independent raters to assess intra- and interobserver reliability via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: Measurements demonstrated excellent agreement between observers and across trials (all ICCsÿòÿ0.960). On the lateral view, the AITFL tibial origin was 9.6ÿñÿ1.5ÿmm superior and posterior to the anterior tibial plafond. Its fibular insertion was 4.4ÿñÿ1.7ÿmm superior and posterior to the anterior fibular tubercle. The centre of the tibial cartilage facet of the tibiofibular contact zone was 8.4ÿñÿ2.1ÿmm posterior and superior to the anterior plafond. The proximal and distal aspects of the ITFL tibial attachment were 45.9ÿñÿ7.9 and 12.4ÿñÿ3.4ÿmm proximal to the central plafond, respectively. The superficial and deep PITFL coursed anterior and distally from the posterior tibia to fibula. On the mortise view, the AITFL tibial attachment centre was 5.6ÿñÿ2.4ÿmm lateral and superior to the lateral extent of the plafond (4.3ÿmm lateral, 3.3ÿmm superior), and its fibular insertion was 21.2ÿñÿ2.1ÿmm superior and medial to the inferior tip of the lateral malleolus. Conclusions: Quantitative radiographic guidelines describing the locations of the primary syndesmotic structures demonstrated excellent reliability and reproducibility. Defined guidelines provide additional clinically relevant information regarding the radiographic anatomy of the syndesmosis and may assist with preoperative planning, augment intraoperative navigation, and provide additional means for objective postoperative assessment. ? 2015, European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-015-3743-0,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"

Although many different surgical techniques have been proposed for reconstruction of a neglected Achilles tendon rupture, there is no clear evidence to support one technique over the others, but the use of a technique that could allow for an ""anatomical"" reconstructions seems desirable. Methods: The present paper describes a new anatomic Achilles tendon reconstruction for chronic tears, using a quadriceps tendon autograft as graft source, with PRP injected into the graft and the neighbor tissue, and fixation in a bone trough with a simple small fragments screw. Results: Autologous quadriceps tendon graft seems an excellent option, although -surprisingly- has received little attention until now. Conclusions: Autologous Quadriceps tendon graft (in bone-tendon configuration) is a simple technique that could allow surgeons to reconstruct tissue defects in the Achilles tendon with non-expensive hardware. ? 2016 Arriaza et al.",Scopus,10.1186/s12891-016-0967-1,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
1418,SC-801,Hangody et al. (2016),2016,Pitfalls during biomechanical testing - Evaluation of different fixation methods for measuring tendons endurance properties,"The goal of the study was to find a proper technique to fix tendon grafts into an INSTRON loading machine. From 8 human cadavers, 40 grafts were collected. We removed the bone-patella tendon-bone grafts, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, the quadriceps tendon-bone grafts, the Achilles tendons, and the peroneus longus tendons from each lower extremity. We tested the tendon grafts with five different types of fixation devices: surgical thread (Premicron 3), general mounting clamp, wire mesh, cement fixation, and a modified clamp for an INSTRON loading machine. The mean failure load in case of surgical thread fixation was (381N ñ 26N). The results with the general clamp were (527N ñ 45N). The wire meshes were more promising (750N ñ 21N), but did not reach the outcomes we desired. Easy slippages of the ends of the tendons from the cement encasements were observed (253N ñ 18N). We then began to use Shi's clamp that could produce 977N ñ 416N peak force. We combined Shi's clamp with freezing of the graft and the rupture of the tendon itself demonstrated an average force of 2198 N ñ 773N. We determined that our modified frozen clamp fixed the specimens against high tensile forces. ? 2016 Akad‚miai Kiad¢, Budapest.",Scopus,10.1556/036.103.2016.1.8,Acta Physiologica Hungarica
1419,SC-802,Ellison et al.

Direct repair may not be possible and augmentation methods are challenging when the defect exceeds 5-6 cm, especially if the distal stump is grossly tendinopathic. Methods: We describe our method of Achilles tendon reconstruction with ipsilateral semitendinosis autograft and interference screw fixation in a patient with chronic rupture, a 9 cm defect and gross distal tendinopathy. Results: Patient reported outcome measures consistently demonstrated improved health status at 12 months post surgery: MOXFQ-Index 38-25, EQ5D-5L 18-9, EQ VAS 70-90 and VISA-A 1-64. The patient was back to full daily function, could single leg heel raise and was gradually returning to sport. No complications or adverse events were recorded. Conclusion: Reconstruction of chronic tears of the Achilles tendon with large defects and gross tendinopathy using an ipsilateral semitendinosis autograft and interference screw fixation can achieve satisfactory improvements in patient reported outcomes up to 1 year post-surgery. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.foot.2015.09.007,Foot
1420,SC-803,Futatsubashi et al. (2016),2016,History-dependent changes in the recovery process of the middle latency cutaneous reflex gain after ankle sprain injury,"Purpose: We previously reported that suppressive middle latency cutaneous reflexes (MLRs) in the peroneus longus (PL) are exaggerated in subjects with chronic ankle instability, and the changes are related to functional instability. However, the time-varying history of these neurophysiological changes after an ankle sprain is yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the time course of the changes in the PLÿMLR after an ankle sprain in relation to the number of sprain recurrences. Methods: Twenty-three subjects with ankle sprain were classified into 3 groups according to their history of ankle sprain: first ankle sprain, 2?3 ankle sprains, and ò4 ankle sprains. Twenty-three age-matched control subjects also participated. The PL MLRs were elicited by stimulating the sural nerve while the subjects performed different levels of isometric ankle eversion. Gain of MLR was estimated using linear regression analysis (slope value) of the amplitude modulation of MLRs obtained from graded isometric contractions. Result: The gain of MLRs first increased 4ÿweeks after the injury. In subjects with their first ankle sprain, the MLRs returned to almost baseline levels after 3ÿmonths. In contrast, the increase in MLR gain persisted even after 3ÿmonths in subjects with recurrent ankle sprains. In addition, the MLR gains were closely related to functional recovery of the ankle joint. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the recovery process of MLR gains were strongly affected by the history of ankle sprains as well as the functional recovery of the ankle joint. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,10.1007/s00421-015-3292-8,European Journal of Applied Physiology
1421,SC-804,Leemann et al. (2016),2016,Crowdsourcing language change with smartphone applications,"Crowdsourcing linguistic phenomena with smartphone applications is relatively new. In linguistics, apps have predominantly been developed to create pronunciation dictionaries, to train acoustic models, and to archive endangered languages. This paper presents the first account of how apps can be used to collect data suitable for documenting language change: we created an app, Dial„kt Žpp (DŽ), which predicts users' dialects. For 16 linguistic variables, users select a dialectal variant from a drop-down menu. DŽ then geographically locates the user's dialect by suggesting a list of communes where dialect variants most similar to their choices are used. Underlying this prediction are 16 maps from the historical Linguistic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland, which documents the linguistic situation around 1950. Where users disagree with the prediction, they can indicate what they consider to be their dialect's location. With this information, the 16 variables can be assessed for language change. Thanks to the playfulness of its functionality, DŽ has reached many users; our linguistic analyses are based on data from nearly 60,000 speakers. Results reveal a relative stability for phonetic variables, while lexical and morphological variables seem more prone to change. Crowdsourcing large amounts of dialect data with smartphone apps has the potential to complement existing data collection techniques and to provide evidence that traditional methods cannot, with normal resources, hope to gather. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize a range of methodological caveats, including sparse knowledge of users' linguistic backgrounds (users only indicate age, sex) and users' self-declaration of their dialect. These are discussed and evaluated in detail here. Findings remain intriguing nevertheless: As a means of quality control, we report that traditional dialectological methods have revealed trends similar to those found by the app. This underlines the validity of the crowdsourcing method. We are presently extending DŽ architecture to other languages. ? 2016 Leemann et al.

We addressed whether altered muscular activity is such a factor. Methods 16 participants with unilateral, non-reconstructed ACL rupture were scored for altered movement patterns according to Test for Substitution Patterns (TSP), which includes the single-leg squat (SLS). Surface electromyography (SEMG), was recorded in the lower extremities at initiation of weight-transfer from double-leg to single-leg stance (eyes closed), simulating the initiation of an SLS. Normalised SEMG amplitudes 200-300 ms after weight-transfer initiation were compared between injured and non-injured sides, and correlated to the TSP scores for the SLS. Peak absolute SEMG amplitudes during 5 TSP test movements were also compared between sides. Results At weight-transfer initiation, muscle activity was lower in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles on the injured side. Low muscle activity correlated moderately to worse TSP scores for the SLS for the gluteus medius (r s =-0.56, p=0.03), and gastrocnemius muscles (r s =-0.56, p=0.02). Median peak absolute amplitude during TSP movements was lower in the quadriceps, gastrocnemius and peroneus longus muscles on the injured side. Conclusions The altered patterns of muscle activity at weight-transfer initiation, correlations between lower activity at movement initiation and altered movement patterns during SLS and the altered peak amplitudes during TSP movements together indicate alterations in sensorimotor control that may contribute to the observed altered movement patterns. Future studies will determine if exercises targeting muscle activity initiation should complement customary ACL injury rehabilitation. ? Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

There is dynamic interplay between the active and passive factors that is directly attributable to an increased risk for ACL injury. Oftentimes, those individuals with both passive and active factors are at the highest risk for ACL injury. Identifying these individuals and providing additional training (i.e., neuromuscular training) have the best potential to mitigate the injury risk. ?

This study aims to better understand the treatment of chronic Achilles tendon rupture. Methods. Patients who were not able to perform a single-limb heel rise were chosen. Pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were conducted. By evaluating the presence or absence of Achilles tendon stumps and the gap length of rupture, V-Y advancement, gastrocnemius fascial turndown flap, or flexor halluces longus tendon transfer were selected for tendon repair. The function of ankle and foot was assessed by American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores and Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS). Results. Twenty-nine patients were followed up. One patient had superficial incision infection, which was healed after debridement and oral antibiotics. Three months postoperatively, MRI showed some signs of inflammation, which disappeared at one or two years postoperatively. All patients were able to perform a single-limb heel rise. Mean AOFAS scores and ATRS scores were increased at the latest follow-up. Conclusion. Surgical options can be determined by evaluating the presence of the Achilles tendon stumps and the gap length, which can avoid using the nearby tendon and yield satisfactory functional results. ? 2016 Yangjing Lin et al.",Scopus,10.1155/2016/1416971,BioMed Research International

Knowledge is emerging from clinical imaging research depicting where MSU crystals deposit, including patellar tendon, triceps and quadriceps tendons. Remarkably, subclinical tendon inflammation and damage are also present in asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Monosodium urate crystals act as danger activating molecular patterns (DAMPs), activating the inflammasome and inducing the secretion of IL-1beta, a key mediator of the inflammatory response. The crucial role of IL-1beta in driving the inflammatory events during gout attacks is supported by the clinical efficacy of IL-1beta blockade. Some data implicating IL-1beta as an initiator of tendinopathy exist, but the link between hyperuricemia and the development of tendinopathy remains to be validated. Further knowledge about the interactions of uric acid with both innate immune and tendon cells, and their consequences may help to determine if there is a subclass of hyperuricemic-tendinopathy. ?

(2016),2016,Quadratic association between corticomotor and spinal-reflexive excitability and self-reported disability in participants with chronic ankle instability,"Context: Spinal-reflexive and corticomotor excitability may have a critical role in altering muscle function needed to stabilize the ankle in people with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Objective: To determine the association between self-reported disability and both spinal-reflexive and corticomotor excitability in people with CAI. Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: 30 participants with CAI. Main Outcome Measures: Soleus spinal-reflexive excitability was measured with normalized Hoffmann reflexes (H:M ratio), and corticomotor excitability was measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation and quantified by normalized motor-evoked-potential (MEP) amplitudes at 120% of active motor threshold (120%MEP). Self-reported disability was quantified with the activities-of-daily-living and sport subscales of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-ADL and FAAM-S). Separate linear Pearson product-moment correlations and nonlinear quadratic correlations were used to determine associations between the neural-excitability and disability variables. Results: Thirty participants were included in the spinal-reflexive-excitability analysis, while only 19 were included in the corticomotor analysis. There was a significant, weak linear association between H:M ratio and FAAM-ADL (R = .39, P = .03) and a nonsignificant, weak linear association between H:M ratio and FAAM-S (R = .36, P = .06). There were significant, moderate quadratic associations between H:M ratio and both FAAM-ADL (R = .48, P = .03) and FAAM-S (R = .50, P = .02). There was a significant, moderate linear association between 120%MEP and FAAM-ADL (R = -.48, P = .04) and a nonsignificant, moderate negative linear association between FAAM-S (R = -.42, P = .07). There was a significant, moderate quadratic association between 120%MEP and FAAM-ADL (R = .57, P = .046) and a significant, strong quadratic correlation between 120%MEP and FAAM-S (R = .71, P = .004). Conclusions: There are significant quadratic associations between self-reported disability and both spinal-reflexive and corticomotor excitability of the soleus. CAI participants with low or high neural excitability present with lower function. ? 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2014-0282,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

(2016),2016,Survival in primary antiphospholipid syndrome: A single-centre cohort study,"The vascular mortality of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) ranges from 1.4 % to 5.5 %, but its predictors are poorly known. It was the study objective to evaluate the impact of baseline lupus anticoagulant assays, IgG anticardiolipin (aCL), plasma fibrinogen (FNG) and von Willebrand factor (VWF), platelets (PLT) and of genetic polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, of prothrombin G20210A and of paraoxonase-1 Q192R on survival in primary APS (PAPS). Cohort study on 77 thrombotic PAPS and 33 asymptomatic carriers of aPL (PCaPL) seen from 1989 to 2015 and persistently positive for aPL as per annual review. At baseline all participants were tested twice for the ratios of kaolin clotting time (KCTr), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTTr), dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVTr), IgG aCL, FNG, VWF and once for PLT. All thrombotic PAPS were on warfarin with regular INR monitoring. During follow-up 11 PAPS deceased (D-PAPS) of recurrent thrombosis mostly arterial, despite adequate anticoagulation yielding an overall vascular mortality of 10 %. D-PAPS had the strongest baseline aPTTr and DRVVTr and the highest mean baseline IgG aCL, FNG, VWF and PLT. Cox proportional hazards model identified baseline DRVVTr and FNG as main predictors of mortality with adjusted hazard ratios of 5.75 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 22.4) and of 1.03 (95 %CI: 1.01, 1.04), respectively. In conclusion, plasma DRVVTr and FNG are strongly associated with the risk of vascular death in PAPS; while FNG lowering agents exist further research should be directed at therapeutic strategies able to dampen aPL production. ?

1433,SC-816,Gali et al. (2016),2016,Tunnel collision during simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner reconstruction,"Purpose: To verify the safest angle to drill femoral tunnels in simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstructions to minimize the risk of tunnel collision and to examine the relationship between lateral femoral condyle (LFC) width and tunnel collision occurrence. Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulations and 10ø axial/30ø coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. Results: Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10ø axial/30ø coronal angulation (Pÿ<ÿ0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (Pÿ<ÿ0.05). Conclusion: Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20ø axial/20ø coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. ? 2014, European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-014-3363-0,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"
1434,SC-817,Wolburg et al.

Design: Cross-sectional laboratory study. Setting: Laboratory setting. Participants: Twenty-five healthy subjects. Main outcome measures: Electromyographic activity of four lower (gastrocnemius medialis, soleus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus) and four upper leg muscles (vastus medialis and lateralis, biceps femoris, semitendinosus) during unipedal quiet barefoot stance on the dominant leg on a flat rigid surface and on five therapy devices with varying stability properties. Results: Muscle activity during unipedal stance differed significantly between therapy devices (P < 0.001). The order from lowest to highest relative muscle activity matched the order from most to least stable therapy device. There was no significant interaction between muscle location (lower versus upper leg) and therapy device (P = 0.985). Magnitudes of additional relative muscle activity for the respective therapy devices differed substantially among lower extremity muscles. Conclusions: The therapy devices offer a progressive increase in training intensity, and thus may be useful for incremental training programs in physiotherapeutic practice and sports training programs. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.ptsp.2015.05.001,Physical Therapy in Sport
1435,SC-818,Donath et al. (2015),2015,Does a single session of high-intensity interval training provoke a transient elevated risk of falling in seniors and adults?,"Background: Balance and strength training can reduce seniors' fall risk up to 50%. Available evidence suggests that acute bouts of neuromuscular and endurance exercise deteriorate postural control. High-intensity endurance training has been successfully applied in different populations. Thus, it seemed valuable to examine the acute effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on neuromuscular performance in seniors and young adults. Objective: The acute impact of a HIIT session on balance performance and muscle activity after exercise cessation and during post-exercise recovery was examined in young and old adults. We intended to investigate whether a transient exercise-induced fall-risk may occur in both groups. Methods: 20 healthy seniors (age 70 (SD 4) years) and young adults (age 27 (SD 3) years) were examined on 3 days. After exhaustive ramp-like treadmill testing in order to determine maximal heart rate (HR<inf>max</inf>) on the first day, either a 4 ? 4 min HIIT at 90% of HR<inf>max</inf> or a control condition (CON) was randomly performed on the second and third day, respectively. Balance performance (postural sway) was assessed during single limb stance with open eyes (SLEO) and double limb stance with closed eyes (DLEC). EMG was recorded for the soleus (SOL), anterior tibialis (TIB), gastrocnemius (GM) and peroneus longus (PL) muscles at the dominant leg. All measures were collected before, immediately as well as 10, 30 and 45 min after HIIT and CON, respectively. Results: Compared to CON, HIIT induced significant increases of postural sway immediately after exercise cessation during SLEO in both groups (adults: p < 0.001, ? = +25% sway; seniors: p = 0.007, ? = +15% sway). Increased sway during DLEC was only found for seniors immediately and 10 min after HIIT (post: p = 0.003, ? = +14% sway, 10 min post: p = 0.004, ? = +18% sway). Muscle activity was increased during SLEO for TIB until 10 min post in seniors (0.008 < p < 0.03) and immediately after HIIT in adults (p < 0.001). Conclusion: HIIT training may cause an acute 'open-fall-window' with a transient impairment of balance performance for at least 10 min after exercise cessation in both groups. Occluded vision in seniors seems to prolong this period up to 30 min. Thus, the advantage of HIIT with regard to time efficiency seems debatable when considering transient HIIT-induced impairments of neuromuscular function. ? 2014 S.

(2015),2015,Anatomic All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Quadriceps Tendon Autograft,"All-inside anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has recently gained popularity, in part because of its bone-sparing socket preparation and reported lower pain levels after surgery. However, because this technique uses suture loops and cortical suspension buttons for graft fixation, it has mostly been limited to looped graft constructs (e.g., hamstring autograft, peroneus longus allograft). Quadriceps tendon autograft offers several advantages in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction but, until recently, has not been compatible with suture-loop and cortical suspensory fixation.

(2015),2015,Quadriceps neural alterations in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed patients: A 6-month longitudinal investigation,"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate differences in quadriceps corticospinal excitability, spinal-reflexive excitability, strength, and voluntary activation before, 2 weeks post and 6 months post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLr). This longitudinal, case-control investigation examined 20 patients scheduled for ACLr (11 females, 9 males; age: 20.9ñ4.4years; height:172.4ñ7.5cm; weight:76.2ñ11.8kg) and 20 healthy controls (11 females, 9 males; age:21.7ñ3.7 years; height: 173.7ñ9.9cm; weight: 76.1ñ19.7kg). Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC), central activation ratio (CAR), normalized Hoffmann spinal reflexes, active motor threshold (AMT), and normalized motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes at 120% of AMT were measured in the quadriceps muscle at the specific time points. ACLr patients demonstrated bilateral reductions in spinal-reflexive excitability compared with controls before surgery (P=0.02) and 2 weeks post-surgery (Pó0.001). ACLr patients demonstrated higher AMT at 6 months post-surgery (Pó0.001) in both limbs. No MEP differences were detected. Quadriceps MVIC and CAR were lower in both limbs of the ACLr group before surgery and 6 months post-surgery (Pó0.05) compared with controls. Diminished excitability of spinal-reflexive and corticospinal pathways are present at different times following ACLr and occur in combination with clinical deficits in quadriceps strength and activation. Early rehabilitation strategies targeting spinal-reflexive excitability may help improve postoperative outcomes, while later-stage rehabilitation may benefit from therapeutic techniques aimed at improving corticospinal excitability. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1439,SC-822,De Ste Croix et al. (2015),2015,Electromechanical delay of the hamstrings during eccentric muscle actions in males and females: Implications for non-contact ACL injuries,"Sex differences in neuromuscular functioning has been proposed as one of the factors behind an increased relative risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in females. The aim of this study was to explore sex differences in electromechanical delay (EMD) of the hamstring muscles during eccentric muscle actions and during a range of movement velocities. This study recruited 110 participants (55 males, 55 females) and electromyography of the semitendinosus, semimembranosus and biceps femoris was determined during eccentric actions at 60, 120 and 240ø/s. No significant sex differences were observed irrespective of muscle examined or movement velocity. Irrespective of sex EMD significantly increased with increasing movement velocity (P< 0.01). There was no significant difference in the EMD of the 3 muscles examined. Our findings suggest that during eccentric actions of the hamstrings that there are no sex differences, irrespective of movement velocity. This would suggest that other factors are probably responsible for the increased relative risk of non-contact ACL injury in females compared to males. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2015.09.006,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology
1440,SC-823,Dingenen et al. (2015),2015,Lower extremity muscle activation onset times during the transition from double-leg stance to single-leg stance in anterior cruciate ligament injured subjects,"The goal of this study was to evaluate muscle activation onset times (MAOT) of both legs during a transition task from double-leg stance (DLS) to single-leg stance (SLS) in anterior cruciate ligament injured (ACLI) (n=15) and non-injured control subjects (n=15) with eyes open and eyes closed. Significantly delayed MAOT were found in the ACLI group compared to the control group for vastus lateralis, vastus medialis obliquus, hamstrings medial, hamstrings lateral, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and gastrocnemius in both vision conditions, for gluteus maximus and gluteus medius with eyes open and for tensor fascia latae with eyes closed. Within the ACLI group, delayed MAOT of tibialis anterior with eyes open and gastrocnemius with eyes closed were found in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg. All other muscles were not significantly different between legs. In conclusion, the ACLI group showed delayed MAOT not only around the knee, but also at the hip and ankle muscles compared to the non-injured control group. No differences between both legs of the ACLI group were found, except for tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius. These findings indirectly support including central nervous system re-education training to target the underlying mechanisms of these altered MAOT after ACL injury. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.humov.2015.09.007,Human Movement Science
1441,SC-824,Foody et al. (2015),2015,Accurate attribute mapping from volunteered geographic information: Issues of volunteer quantity and quality,"Crowdsourcing is a popular means of acquiring data, but the use of such data is limited by concerns with its quality. This is evident within cartography and geographical sciences more generally, with the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) recognized as a major challenge to address if the full potential of citizen sensing in mapping applications is to be realized. Here, a means to characterize the quality of volunteers, based only on the data they contribute, was used to explore issues connected with the quantity and quality of volunteers for attribute mapping. The focus was on data in the form of annotations or class labels provided by volunteers who visually interpreted an attribute, land cover, from a series of satellite sensor images. A latent class model was found to be able to provide accurate characterizations of the quality of volunteers in terms of the accuracy of their labelling, irrespective of the number of cases that they labelled. The accuracy with which a volunteer could be characterized tended to increase with the number of volunteers contributing but was typically good at all but small numbers of volunteers. Moreover, the ability to characterize volunteers in terms of the quality of their labelling could be used constructively. For example, volunteers could be ranked in terms of quality which could then be used to select a sub-set as input to a subsequent mapping task. This was particularly important as an identified subset of volunteers could undertake a task more accurately than when part of a larger group of volunteers. The results highlight that both the quantity and quality of volunteers need consideration and that the use of VGI may be enhanced through information on the quality of the volunteers derived entirely from the data provided without any additional information. ?

1442,SC-825,Cho et al. (2015),2015,Minimal invasive suture-tape augmentation for chronic ankle instability,"Background: Although the modified Brostrom procedure has had excellent clinical results, postoperative complications such as skin irritation by suture material and problematic scar formation occur. This prospective study was performed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of mini-open ligament augmentation (internal brace technique) using suture tape for chronic ankle instability in a select cohort of patients. Methods: Thirty-four young female patients with less than 70 kg of body weight were followed for more than 2 years after suture tape augmentation for lateral ankle instability. The clinical evaluation consisted of the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) score, Sefton grading system, and the period to return to various activities. Measurement of talar tilt angle and anterior talar translation was obtained from stress radiographs to evaluate the longevity of mechanical ankle stability. Results: FAOS and FAAM scores had significantly improved to 92.5 points at final follow-up (P <.001). According to the Sefton grading, 31 cases (91.2%) achieved satisfactory functional results. The period to return to exercise was on average 10.2 weeks for jogging and 9.6 weeks for walking on uneven ground. The average subjective satisfaction score of patients was 93.8 points, and satisfaction with the scar was 98.5 points. Talar tilt angle and anterior talar translation had significantly improved to an average of 4.5 degrees and 4.1 mm, respectively, at final follow-up (P <.001). There were no complications such as skin irritation and wound infection, except for 1 case of chronic inflammation. Conclusions: Minimally invasive suture tape augmentation seems to be an effective alternative for young women with chronic ankle instability. Because there is a possibility of progressive elongation over time, the longevity of mechanical ankle stability and the proper indication for using the internal brace technique should be addressed in future studies.

(2015),2015,Radiographic identification of the deltoid ligament complex of the medial ankle,"Background: An injury to the deltoid ligament complex of the ankle can require surgical intervention in cases of chronic instability. There is an absence of data describing medial ankle ligament anatomy on standard radiographic views. Purpose: To quantitatively describe the anatomic origins and insertions of the individual ligamentous bands of the superficial and deep deltoid on standard lateral and mortise radiographic views with reference to osseous landmarks and anatomic axes. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Twelve nonpaired, fresh-frozen cadaveric foot and ankle specimens were utilized. Specimens were dissected free of all overlying soft tissue to identify individual ligamentous bands of the superficial and deep deltoid ligaments and to isolate their distinct origins and insertions. Footprint centers were identified on standard lateral and mortise radiographs by 2-mm stainless steel spheres embedded at the level of the cortical bone. Distances to osseous landmarks were measured independently by 2 blinded reviewers to calculate mean distances and evaluate reliability and repeatability measures using intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: Varying subsets of the 4 superficial deltoid bands including the tibionavicular (12/12), tibiospring (12/12), tibiocalcaneal (9/12), and superficial posterior tibiotalar (9/12) ligaments were found across specimens. On the lateral view, the tibionavicular ligament was the most anterior and attached 7.6 ñ 1.9 mm superior and anterior to the inferior tip of the medial malleolus. The tibiospring ligament attached 12.1 ñ 2.2 mm superior and anterior to the inferior tip of the medial malleolus and attached to the spring ligament, which coursed from its origin 12.3 ñ 1.6 mm anterior and slightly inferior to the posterior point of the sustentaculum tali to its insertion on the navicular tuberosity. The tibiocalcaneal ligament and superficial posterior tibiotalar ligament were found posteriorly in the majority of specimens. Two constituents of the deep deltoid, including the deep anterior tibiotalar (11/12) and deep posterior tibiotalar (12/12) ligaments, were found in the majority of specimens. The deep posterior was larger and coursed from the tibia, 8.1 ñ 2.2 mm posterior and superior to the inferior tip of the medial malleolus, to its attachment on the talus, 15.5 ñ 2.4 mm superior and anterior to the posterior inferior point of the talus on the lateral view. Conclusion: Quantitative radiographic relationships describing the anatomic origins and insertions of the individual superficial and deep deltoid constituents were defined with excellent reliability and reproducibility. Clinical Relevance: Radiographic parameters will augment current anatomic data by assisting with preoperative planning, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative assessment. These radiographic guidelines will facilitate the development of novel anatomic reconstructions and allow surgeons to plan the locations of reconstruction tunnels. ? 2015 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546515605514,American Journal of Sports Medicine

(2015),2015,Concussion frequency associates with musculoskeletal injury in retired NFL players,"Objective Concussion is commonly associated with immediate and persistent alterations in motor function affecting postural control and gait. Patients with lower extremity joint injury have demonstrated functional alterations in the cerebral cortex, suggesting that musculoskeletal injury may be linked to alterations in brain function. Therefore, we examined the associations between concussion frequency and lower extremity musculoskeletal injury sustained during professional careers of National Football League (NFL) players in a cross-sectional study. Methods An inclusive health history survey was mailed to 3647 NFL players who retired during 1930-2001. Respondents reported total concussion frequency (zero, one, two, or three or more) and presence (yes/no) of specific knee and ankle musculoskeletal injury during their NFL career. Separate logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between concussion frequency and each musculoskeletal injury type, adjusting for number of years played in the NFL, body mass index while playing in the NFL, and playing position. Results Data from 2429 players (66.6% response rate) were available for analysis. Nearly 61% reported experiencing a concussion while competing in the NFL. Meniscal tear was the most commonly reported musculoskeletal injury (32%). Compared with NFL players who did not sustain a concussion, retired NFL players with one, two, or three or more concussions had between 18% and 63%, 15% and 126%, and 73% and 165% higher odds of reporting various musculoskeletal injuries, respectively. Conclusions A history of concussions was associated with a history of musculoskeletal injuries during NFL careers. These data suggest that a higher number of concussions is linked with higher odds of reporting a musculoskeletal injury. ? 2015 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1249/MSS.0000000000000684,Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise

Better results are described by open and more anatomical procedures. In this study, a new, standardized, arthroscopic technique for anatomical popliteus tendon (PLT) reconstruction is evaluated. Methods: In 13 cadaver knees, an arthroscopic reconstruction of the PLT and the lateral collateral ligament was performed. Twelve defined landmarks were used for arthroscopic tunnel placement, and the distance of the tunnel locations to these specific landmarks was evaluated. Results: The femoral drill channel was located with a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility in the centre of the femoral footprint of the PLT (on average 1.1 (ñ1.6) mm distal from the centre). On the tibial side, the drill channel was in the distal third of the sulcus popliteus in all cases. On average, the channel was placed exactly at the level of the tip of the fibula (ñ1.5ÿmm) and 0.6 (ñ1.7) mm medially from the medial edge of the fibula. The centre of the channel was 13.4 (ñ2.3) mm distal from the joint line. Conclusions: The presented arthroscopic technique for PLT reconstruction is standardized, reproducible and has a high accuracy for the placement of the tibial and femoral tunnel. The technique could be clinically relevant for future arthroscopic posterolateral corner reconstructions.

1446,SC-829,Huh et al. (2015),2015,Allograft reconstruction of chronic tibialis anterior tendon ruptures,"Background: Chronic ruptures of the tibialis anterior tendon are often associated with tendon retraction and poor-quality tissue, resulting in large segmental defects that make end-to-end repair impossible. Interpositional allograft reconstruction has previously been described as an operative option in these cases; however, there are no reports of the clinical outcomes of this technique in the literature. Methods: Eleven patients with chronic tibialis anterior tendon ruptures underwent intercalary allograft recon-struction between 2006 and 2013. Patient demographics, injury presentation, and details of surgery were reviewed. Postoperative outcomes at a mean follow-up of 43.8 (range, 6-105) months included the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot score, Short Form-12 (SF-12) physical health score, Lower Extremity Functional Score (LEFS), visual analog scale (VAS) pain rating, dorsiflexion strength, gait analysis, and complications. Results: The average postoperative dorsiflexion strength, as categorized by the Medical Council grading scale, was 4.8 ñ 0.45. The average postoperative VAS score was 0.8 ñ 1.1. The average LEFS was 66.9 ñ 17.2, SF-12 physical health score was 40.1 ñ 14.4, and AOFAS score was 84.3 ñ 7.7. One complication occurred, consisting of transient neuritic pain in the superficial peroneal nerve distribution. There were no postoperative infections, tendon reruptures, reoperations, or allograft-associated complications. Conclusion: Allograft reconstruction of chronic irreparable tibialis anterior tendon ruptures yielded satisfactory strength, pain, and patient-reported functional outcomes.

1447,SC-830,Liao et al. (2015),2015,Elastic properties of Thiel-embalmed human ankle tendon and ligament,"Thiel embalming is recommended as an alternative to formalin-based embalming because it preserves tissue elasticity, color, and flexibility in the long term, with low infection and toxicity risk. The degree to which Thiel embalming preserves elasticity has so far been assessed mainly by subjective scoring, with little quantitative verification. The aim of this study is to quantify the effect of Thiel embalming on the elastic properties of human ankle tendons and ligament. Biomechanical tensile tests were carried out on six Thiel-embalmed samples each of the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, and calcaneal tendons, and the calcaneofibular ligament, with strain rates of 0.25%s-1, 2%s-1, and 8%s-1. The stress-strain relationship was calculated from the force-extension response with cross-sectional area and gauge length. Young's modulus was determined from the stress-strain curve. The results showed that the tendon and ligament elasticity were lower after Thiel embalming than the literature values for fresh nonembalmed tendons and ligament. The biomechanical tensile test showed that the measured elasticity of Thiel-embalmed tendons and ligaments increased with the strain rate. The Thiel embalming method is useful for preserving human ankle tendons and ligaments for anatomy and surgery teaching and research, but users need to be aware of its softening effects. The method retains the mechanical strain rate effect on tendons and ligament. Clin.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of functional fatiguing exercises on sagittal-plane lower-extremity neuromechanics during a forward-side jump. 21 participants performed 5 forward-side jump tasks before and after functional fatiguing exercises. A functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) evaluated differences between 2 different conditions (pre- vs. post-fatigue) for joint angle, moment, and EMG amplitude during stance of a forward-side jump. FANOVA compared variables as polynomial functions, and differences between functions with 95% confidence interval bands were plotted to determine significant differences. Plantar, knee, and hip flexion decreased during the initial stages of landing following fatigue. Plantarflexion moment decreased during 10-20% of stance in post-fatigue. Knee extension moment initially increased while decreased during 20-30% of stance following fatigue. Hip extension moment initially decreased while increased at 20% of stance. Tibialis anterior EMG decreased during 30-40% of stance, vastus lateralis EMG increased at 15% of stance, hamstring EMG decreased at foot contact and during 25-60% of stance, and gluteus maximus EMG decreased at foot contact and 35% of stance. The functional fatiguing exercises resulted in a more upright landing position, potentially indicating a greater reliance upon skeletal structures for support. ?

(2015),2015,Half-peroneus-longus-tendon graft augmentation for unqualified hamstring tendon graft of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Background: In some situations, harvested hamstring tendon grafts are not qualified for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This study aimed to present a reinforcing method with additional half peroneus longus tendon (half-PLT) graft augmentation. Methods: Eight cases underwent ACL reconstruction with unqualified hamstring tendon grafts (diameterÿ<7ÿmm) and were salvaged by additional half-PLT graft augmentation. The pivot shift test and KT-1000 tests were performed 3ÿyears after surgery. Functional evaluation of subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores was also done. In addition, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were used to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Results: The diameter of unqualified four-strand hamstring tendon grafts was 6.2ÿmm on average (range, 6.0?6.5ÿmm). The average diameter of hamstring grafts with half-PLT augmentation was 9.6ÿmm (range, 9.5?10.0ÿmm). The pivot shift test was negative in all patients. No significant differences between normal and abnormal knees were found by KT-1000. The average IKDC score was 86.0 (range, 83 to 89), and the average Lysholm score was 84.4 (range, 80?90). The average FADI score for the donor sites of half-PLT was 135.8 (range, 134?136). Conclusions: Additional half-PLT can successfully and safely reinforce unqualified hamstring tendon grafts for ACL reconstruction. ? 2015, The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.",Scopus,10.1007/s00776-015-0744-2,Journal of Orthopaedic Science
1450,SC-833,Taylor et al. (2015),2015,Prevention of Lower Extremity Injuries in Basketball: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Context: Lower extremity injuries are common in basketball, yet it is unclear how prophylactic interventions affect lower extremity injury incidence rates. Objective: To analyze the effectiveness of current lower extremity injury prevention programs in basketball athletes, focusing on injury rates of (1) general lower extremity injuries, (2) ankle sprains, and (3) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Data Sources: PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched in January 2015. Study Selection: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled or prospective cohort trials, contained a population of competitive basketball athletes, and reported lower extremity injury incidence rates specific to basketball players. In total, 426 individual studies were identified. Of these, 9 met the inclusion criteria. One other study was found during a hand search of the literature, resulting in 10 total studies included in this meta-analysis. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Level of Evidence: Level 2. Data Extraction: Details of the intervention (eg, neuromuscular vs external support), size of control and intervention groups, and number of injuries in each group were extracted from each study. Injury data were classified into 3 groups based on the anatomic diagnosis reported (general lower extremity injury, ankle sprain, ACL rupture). Results: Meta-analyses were performed independently for each injury classification. Results indicate that prophylactic programs significantly reduced the incidence of general lower extremity injuries (odds ratio [OR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.85; P < 0.001) and ankle sprains (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.69; P < 0.001), yet not ACL ruptures (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.36-3.29; P = 0.87) in basketball athletes. Conclusion: In basketball players, prophylactic programs may be effective in reducing the risk of general lower extremity injuries and ankle sprains, yet not ACL injuries. ? 2015, ? 2015 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/1941738115593441,Sports Health

It can be traumatic or spontaneous. Spontaneous rupture is usually a consequence of degenerative changes of the tendon caused by accompanying diseases. For successful treatment and rehabilitation early diagnosis is mandatory. For diagnosis, a clinical examination is most important and ultrasound examination and/or magnetic resonance additionally confirms the diagnosis. Treatment can be surgical or conservative with a below-knee non-weight bearing cast. Conservative treatment is usually decided where ruptures are older than three months, especially in patients with poorer mobility or with accompanying diseases. There are several surgical treatment techniques reported in the literature. Case report: A 56-year old men with diabetes mellitus and polyneuropathy sustained a rupture of the tibialis anterior tendon when walking downhill. The rupture was initially unrecognized and was treated as an ankle sprain. After two months he was reexamined and a rupture of the tibialis anterior tendon was diagnosed and surgically reconstructed using a semitendinosus tendon graft. Conclusion: Rupture of the anterior tendon of the tibialis muscle was reconstructed by using an autologous graft of the semitendinosus muscle tendon, in which we achieved good long-term results. Tendon of the semitendinosus is suitable because it has properties similar to anterior tendon of the tibialis muscle. Because of the similar diameters it is also suitable for bridging of longer defects, such as in our case. ? 2015, Slovene Medical Society.",Scopus,0,Zdravniski Vestnik
1452,SC-835,Yen et al. (2015),2015,Alteration of ankle kinematics and muscle activity during heel contact when walking with external loading,"Purpose: The risk of recurrent ankle sprains could be reduced if the ankle joint is positioned in a more closed pack position (eversion and dorsiflexion) with enhanced co-activation of Tibialis Anterior (TA) and Peroneus Longus (PL) around heel contact in walking. We examined whether such alteration can be induced by augmenting ankle position error in the inversion and plantarflexion directions. Methods: Fifteen young, healthy subjects participated in this study. They walked on a treadmill while a light weight was affixed to the dorsal?lateral side of the test foot to create afferent error signals in the inversion and plantarflexion directions. We recorded and analyzed subjects? ankle kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity of TA and PL before (baseline), during (adaptation), and after (post adaptation) walking with the weight. Our analyses focused on 30ÿms before and after heel contact where ankle sprains are most likely to occur. Results: Subjects increased ankle eversion before and after heel contact during the adaptation period. This increase carried over to the post adaptation period following removal of the weight. The weight also induced an increase in the TA activity before heel contact during late adaptation, although this increase did not carry over to the post adaptation period. No significant changes were observed in ankle dorsiflexion, PL activity, and muscle co-activation. Conclusion: Our error-driven approach is feasible to reduce ankle inversion around heel contact in walking, and may have clinical implication on intervention of recurrent ankle sprains. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,10.1007/s00421-015-3154-4,European Journal of Applied Physiology

(2015),2015,Chronic ankle instability and neural excitability of the lower extremity,"Context: Neuromuscular dysfunction of the leg and thigh musculature, including decreased strength and postural control, is common in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Understanding how CAI affects specific neural pathways may provide valuable information for targeted therapies. Objective: To investigate differences in spinal reflexive and corticospinal excitability of the fibularis longus and vastus medialis between limbs in patients with unilateral CAI and between CAI patients and participants serving as healthy controls. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 56 participants volunteered, and complete data for 21 CAI patients (9 men, 12 women; age=20.81 ñ 1.63 years, height=171.57 ñ 11.44 cm, mass = 68.84 ñ 11.93 kg) and 24 healthy participants serving as controls (7 men, 17 women; age=22.54 ñ 2.92 years, height = 172.35 ñ 10.85 cm, mass =69.15 ñ 12.30 kg) were included in the final analyses. Control participants were matched to CAI patients on sex, age, and limb dominance. We assigned involved limbs, which corresponded with the involved limbs of the CAI patients, to control participants. Main Outcome Measure(s): Spinal reflexive excitability was assessed via the Hoffmann reflex and normalized to a maximal muscle response. Corticospinal excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Active motor threshold (AMT) was defined as the lowest transcranial magnetic stimulation intensity required to elicit motor-evoked potentials equal to or greater than 100 lV in 5 of 10 consecutive stimuli. We obtained motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) at percentages ranging from 100% to 140% of AMT. Results: Fibularis longus MEP amplitudes were greater in control participants than in CAI patients bilaterally at 100% AMT (control involved limb: 0.023 ñ 0.031; CAI involved limb: 0.014 ñ 0.008; control uninvolved limb: 0.021 ñ 0.022; CAI uninvolved limb: 0.015 ñ 0.007; F1,41 = 4.551, P =.04) and 105% AMT (control involved limb: 0.029 ñ 0.026; CAI involved limb: 0.021 ñ 0.009; control uninvolved limb: 0.034 ñ 0.037; CAI uninvolved limb: 0.023 ñ 0.013; F1,35 = 4.782, P =.04). We observed no differences in fibularis longus MEP amplitudes greater than 110% AMT and no differences in vastus medialis corticospinal excitability (P.05). We noted no differences in the Hoffmann reflex between groups for the vastus medialis (F1,37=0.103, P=.75) or the fibularis longus (F1,41 = 1.139, P =.29). Conclusions: Fibularis longus corticospinal excitability was greater in control participants than in CAI patients. ? by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.",Scopus,10.4085/1062-6050-50.4.06,Journal of Athletic Training
1454,SC-837,Friedrich et al. (2015),2015,The sick and the weak: Neuropathies/ myopathies in the critically ill,"Friedrich O, Reid MB, Van den Berghe G, Vanhorebeek I, Hermans G, Rich MM, and Larsson L. The Sick and the Weak: Neuropathies/Myopathies in the Critically Ill. Physiol Rev 5: 1025-1109, 2015; Published July 1, 2015; doi:10.1152/physrev.00028.2014.? Critical illness polyneuropathies (CIP) and myopathies (CIM) are common complica- tions of critical illness. Several weakness syndromes are summarized under the term intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW). We propose a classification of different ICUAW forms (CIM, CIP, sepsis-induced, steroid-denervation myopathy) and pathophysiological mechanisms from clinical and animal model data. Triggers include sepsis, mechanical ventila- tion, muscle unloading, steroid treatment, or denervation. Some ICUAW forms require strin- gent diagnostic features; CIM is marked by membrane hypoexcitability, severe atrophy, pref- erential myosin loss, ultrastructural alterations, and inadequate autophagy activation while myopathies in pure sepsis do not reproduce marked myosin loss. Reduced membrane excit- ability results from depolarization and ion channel dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction con- tributes to energy-dependent processes. Ubiquitin proteasome and calpain activation trigger muscle proteolysis and atrophy while protein synthesis is impaired. Myosin loss is more pronounced than actin loss in CIM. Protein quality control is altered by inadequate autophagy. Ca2dysregulation is present through altered Ca2homeostasis. We highlight clinical hall-marks, trigger factors, and potential mechanisms from human studies and animal models that allow separation of risk factors that may trigger distinct mechanisms contributing to weakness. During critical illness, altered inflammatory (cytokines) and metabolic pathways deteriorate muscle function. ICUAW prevention/treatment is limited, e.g., tight glycemic control, delaying nutrition, and early mobilization. Future challenges include identification of primary/secondary events during the time course of critical illness, the interplay between membrane excitability, bioenergetic failure and differential proteolysis, and finding new therapeutic targets by help of tailored animal models. ? ? 2015 theAmerican Physiological Society",Scopus,10.1152/physrev.00028.2014,Physiological Reviews
1455,SC-838,Angthong et al. (2015),2015,The anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the peroneus longus tendon: A biomechanical and clinical evaluation of the donor ankle morbidity,"Background: The purpose of this study was to report on ankle and foot functions via the holistic evaluations using clinical examination, functional scores assessment and isokinetic tests after harvesting autogenous peroneus longus tendons for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction focusing on the donor site morbidity with a minimum 1-year follow-up period. Material and Method: The study included 24 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft and endobutton fixation. Results of ACL reconstruction were assessed via physical examination. Donor site morbidity of the foot and ankle after tendon-harvesting was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot-and-Ankle Society (AOFAS) for ankle-hindfoot score and Visual Analogue Score-Foot Ankle (VAS-FA). Isokinetic testing for the ankle was performed in 10 voluntary patients after surgery. Results: Mean follow-up time was 12.8 months. Regarding the latest follow-up, anterior drawer tests of ankle showed normal findings in 83.3%, and 1+ anterior laxity in 16.7% of all patients. Mean pre- and postoperative AOFAS scores were 100.0 ñ0.0 and 96.0ñ9.6, respectively at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.06). Mean pre- and postoperative VAS-FA scores were 99.7ñ1.1 and 95.4ñ12.0, respectively at ~13-month follow-up (p = 0.09). At 7-month follow-up by isokinetic testing, peak torques of eversion and inversion were significantly lower on the harvested ankle compared with the contralateral ankle at both velocities (60ø/second and 120ø/second, p<0.05). Conclusion: Based on overall findings in the present study, the authors could not recommend the peroneus longus tendon as the first option of donor graft for ACL reconstruction due to the several morbidities particularly in the first 12 months after the operation. However, the peroneus longus tendon may be the option after other graft harvestings for the ligament reconstruction, which needs several tendon grafts in a patient with multi-directional instability of the knee due to some specific situation such as a traumatic knee dislocation. ? 2015, Medical Association of Thailand.

1456,SC-839,Pietrosimone et al. (2015),2015,Neural excitability alterations after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Context: Neuromuscular dysfunction is common after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). However, little is known about quadriceps spinal-reflex and descending corticomotor excitability after ACL-R. Understanding the effects of ACL-R on spinal-reflex and corticomotor excitability will help elucidate the origins of neuromuscular dysfunction. Objective: To determine whether spinal-reflex excitability and corticomotor excitability differed between the injured and uninjured limbs of patients with unilateral ACL-R and between these limbs and the matched limbs of healthy participants. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 28 patients with unilateral ACL-R (9 men, 19 women; age = 21.28 ñ 3.79 years, height = 170.95 ñ 10.04 cm, mass = 73.18 ñ 18.02 kg, time after surgery = 48.10 ñ 36.17 months) and 29 participants serving as healthy controls (9 men, 20 women; age = 21.55 6 2.70 years, height = 170.59 ñ 8.93 cm, mass = 71.89 ñ 12.70 kg) volunteered. Main Outcome Measure(s): Active motor thresholds (AMTs) were collected from the vastus medialis (VM) using transcranial magnetic stimulation. We evaluated VM spinal reflexes using the Hoffmann reflex normalized to maximal muscle responses (H : M ratio). Voluntary quadriceps activation was measured with the superimposed-burst technique and calculated using the central activation ratio (CAR). We also evaluated whether ACL-R patients with high or low voluntary activation had different outcomes. Results: The AMT was higher in the injured than in the uninjured limb in the ACL-R group (t<inf>27</inf> = 3.32, P = .003) and in the matched limb of the control group (t<inf>55</inf> = 2.05, P = .04). The H : M ratio was bilaterally higher in the ACL-R than the control group (F<inf>1,55</inf> = 5.17, P = .03). The quadriceps CAR was bilaterally lower in the ACL-R compared with the control group (F<inf>1,55</inf> = 10.5, P = .002). The ACL-R group with low voluntary activation (CAR < 0.95) had higher AMT than the control group (P = .02), whereas the ACL-R group with high voluntary activation (CAR ò 0.95) demonstrated higher H : M ratios than the control group (P = .05). Conclusions: The higher VM AMT in the injured limbs of ACL-R patients suggested that corticomotor deficits were present after surgery. Higher bilateral H : M ratios in ACL-R patients may be a strategy to reflexively increase excitability to maintain voluntary activation. ? by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.",Scopus,10.4085/1062-6050-50.1.11,Journal of Athletic Training
1457,SC-840,Zuil-Escobar et al. (2015),2015,Prevalence of myofascial trigger points and diagnostic criteria of different muscles in function of the medial longitudinal arch,"Objectives To evaluate the reliability of the used diagnostic criteria of latent trigger points (LTrPs) and pressure pain thresholds and to evaluate the prevalence of LTrPs in several muscles of the lower limb in subjects with a lower medial longitudinal arch (MLA) compared with controls. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting University campus. Participants Subjects with a lower limb MLA (n=82) and controls (n=82) (N=164). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures The navicular drop test was used to classify subjects with a lower MLA (ò10mm) and controls (5-9mm). The Simons et al recommended specific diagnostic criteria and pressure pain thresholds were used to evaluate the prevalence of LTrPs in several muscles of the lower limb, which was compared between the 2 groups. The reliability was evaluated using Cohen's kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient. The unpaired Student t test and chi-square test were used to evaluate the difference in the LTrP prevalence between the 2 groups. Results The intrarater reliability of the navicular drop test and the diagnosis of LTrPs was excellent, with the taut band and tender spot being the most reliable diagnostic criteria. In the lower MLA group, 60 subjects (73%) presented at least 1 LTrP whereas 57 controls (70%) presented at least 1 LTrP. The lower MLA group showed more LTrPs (4.46ñ4.10) than did controls (3.32ñ3.24) (P<.05). There were significantly (P<.05) more subjects with LTrPs in the flexor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, and vastus medialis in the lower MLA group than in the control group. Conclusions LTrPs are common in the lower limb muscles in both controls and subjects with a lower MLA. A lower MLA is associated with a higher prevalence of LTrPs, which are significant in the flexor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, and vastus medialis. ? 2015 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.",Scopus,10.1016/j.apmr.2015.02.017,Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
1458,SC-841,Zelik et al. (2015),2015,Coordination of intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles during walking,"Purpose: The human foot undergoes complex deformations during walking due to passive tissues and active muscles. However, based on prior recordings it is unclear if muscles that contribute to flexion/extension of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints are activated synchronously to modulate joint impedance, or sequentially to perform distinct biomechanical functions. We investigated the coordination of MTP flexors and extensors with respect to each other, and to other ankle?foot muscles. Methods: We analyzed surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings of intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles for healthy individuals during level treadmill walking, and also during sideways and tiptoe gaits. We computed stride-averaged EMG envelopes and used the timing of peak muscle activity to assess synchronous vs. sequential coordination. Results: We found that peak MTP flexor activity occurred significantly before peak MTP extensor activity during walking (Pÿ<ÿ0.001). The period around stance-to-swing transition could be roughly characterized by sequential peak muscle activity from the ankle plantarflexors, MTP flexors, MTP extensors, and then ankle dorsiflexors. We found that foot muscles that activated synchronously during forward walking tended to dissociate during other locomotor tasks. For instance, extensor hallucis brevis and extensor digitorum brevis muscle activation peaks decoupled during sideways gait. Conclusions: The sequential peak activity of MTP flexors followed by MTP extensors suggests that their biomechanical contributions may be largely separable from each other and from other extrinsic foot muscles during walking. Meanwhile, the task-specific coordination of the foot muscles during other modes of locomotion indicates a high-level of specificity in their function and control. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,10.1007/s00421-014-3056-x,European Journal of Applied Physiology
1459,SC-842,Pietrosimone et al. (2015),2015,Immediate increases in quadriceps corticomotor excitability during an electromyography biofeedback intervention,"The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of EMG-BF on vastus lateralis corticomotor excitability, measured via motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes elicited using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). We also determined the effect of EMG-BF on isometric knee extensor strength. Fifteen healthy participants volunteered for this crossover study with two sessions held one-week apart. Participants were randomly assigned to condition order, during which five intervention MVICs were performed with or without EMG-BF. MEP amplitudes were collected with TMS during five knee extension contractions (5% of MVIC) at baseline and again during intervention MVICs within each session. During the control condition, participants were instructed to perform the same number of MVICs without any EMG-BF. Percent change scores were used to calculate the change in peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes that occurred during EMG-BF and Control MVICs compared to the baseline MEPs. Peak knee extension torque was recorded during MVICs prior to TMS for each condition. EMG-BF produced significantly increased MEP change scores and significantly greater torque than the control condition. The results of the current study suggest that EMG-BF may be a viable clinical method for targeting corticomotor excitability. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2014.11.007,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology
1460,SC-843,Terada et al. (2015),2015,Alterations in stride-to-stride variability during walking in individuals with chronic ankle instability,"The aim of this study was to evaluate stride-to-stride variability of the lower extremity during walking in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI) using a nonlinear analysis. Twenty-five participants with self-reported CAI and 27 healthy control participants volunteered for this study. Participants walked on a motor-driven treadmill for 3. min at their selected speed. Lower extremity kinematics in the sagittal and frontal planes were recorded using a passive retroreflective marker motion capture system. The temporal structure of walking variability was analyzed with sample entropy (SampEn). The CAI group produced lower SampEn values in frontal-plane ankle kinematics compared to the control group (P=04). No significant group differences were observed for SampEn values of other kinematics (P > 05). Participants with CAI demonstrated less stride-to-stride variability of the frontal plane ankle kinematics compared to healthy controls. Decreased variability of walking patterns demonstrated by participants with CAI indicates that the presence of CAI may be associated with a less adaptable sensorimotor system to environmental changes. The altered sensorimotor function associated with CAI may be targets for clinical interventions, and it is critical to explore how interventions protocols affect sensorimotor system function. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.humov.2014.12.004,Human Movement Science

We assessed the maximum calf circumference and isometric plantar flexion strength before surgery and at the last follow up. The Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS) and number of single-leg heel lifts on the affected leg were evaluated at the last follow up. The median follow up was 39ÿmonths.Results: The outcome of surgery was excellent/good in 17 (81ÿ%) of 21 patients. In the operated leg, the maximum calf circumference and isometric plantar flexion strength were significantly improved after surgery (P < 0.0001). The average ATRS was 86 (range 79-92), and the average number of single-legged heel lifts was 33 (range 11?48). No further re-ruptures were recorded.Conclusions: Minimally invasive ipsilateral PB transfer and free ipsilateral ST graft with or without interference screw fixation are safe and effective procedures to reconstruct the Achilles tendon after a re-rupture, providing a significant improvement of the symptoms and function in the mid term. ? 2015, SICOT aisbl.",Scopus,10.1007/s00264-015-2686-x,International Orthopaedics

(2015),2015,Neuromuscular deficits after peripheral joint injury: A neurophysiological hypothesis,"In addition to biomechanical disturbances, peripheral joint injuries (PJIs) can also result in chronic neuromuscular alterations due in part to loss of mechanoreceptor-mediated afferent feedback. An emerging perspective is that PJI should be viewed as a neurophysiological dysfunction, not simply a local injury. Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have provided some evidence for central nervous system (CNS) reorganization at both the cortical and spinal levels after PJI. The novel hypothesis proposed is that CNS reorganization is the underlying mechanism for persisting neuromuscular deficits after injury, particularly muscle weakness. There is a lack of direct evidence to support this hypothesis, but future studies utilizing force-matching tasks with superimposed transcranial magnetic stimulation may be help clarify this notion. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Scopus,10.1002/mus.24463,Muscle and Nerve
1463,SC-846,Hossain et al. (2015),2015,Crowdsourcing: A comprehensive literature review,"Purpose ? The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of crowdsourcing literature. Design/methodology/approach ? This study is a comprehensive review of 346 articles on crowdsourcing. Both statistical and contents analyses were conducted in this paper. Findings ? International Scientifc Indexing (ISI) listed journal articles, non-ISI listed journal articles and conference articles have had nearly the same contribution in crowdsourcing literature. Articles published in non-ISI listed journals have had an essential role in the initial theory development related to crowdsourcing. Scholars from the USA have authored approximately the same number of articles as scholars from all the European countries combined. Scholars from developing countries have been more relatively active in authoring conference articles than journal articles. Only very recently, top-tier journals have engaged in publishing on crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing has proven to be benefcial in many tasks, but the extant literature does not give much help to practitioners in capturing value from crowdsourcing. Despite understanding that the motivations of crowds are crucial when planning crowdsourcing activities, the various motivations in different contexts have not been explored suffciently. A major concern has been the quality and accuracy of information that has been gathered through crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing bears a lot of unused potential. For example, it can increase employment opportunities to low-income people in developing countries. On the other hand, more should be known of fair ways to organize crowdsourcing so that solution seekers do not get a chance to exploit individuals committing to provide solutions. Research limitations/implications ? The literature included in the study is extensive, but an all-inclusive search for articles was limited to only nine selected publishers.

1464,SC-847,Kompel et al. (2015),2015,Imaging of American football injuries,"American football games are a centerpiece of sports culture in the United States. The excitement and physicality make the sport attractive to fans, and yet the athletes put themselves at risk for injury with every snap of the football. While this is true for many sports, gridiron football has the highest rate of injury among all major sports. Catastrophic injuries have declined with improvements in equipment, coaching, and rule modification. At the same time, however, advancements in training methods over the past few decades have led to bigger, stronger, and faster players. The result is harder tackles and quicker cutting and pivoting movements that make the game more exciting to watch but lead to frequent musculoskeletal injuries. Lower extremity injuries are the most common, with the knee and ankle the most frequently injured. Sprains and strains occur more often than bone injuries or concussions. Given that more injuries involve the soft tissues, MRI has a distinct advantage over radiography and CT for direct evaluation of the injury. The high accuracy of MRI in diagnosis has lead to its increased utilization especially among professional athletes. In addition, concomitant injuries may be discovered that were unsuspected on physical exam and radiography. Ultimately, the player is the main determinant when deciding when to return to play from an injury, although imaging can assist in the treatment algorithm and help estimate the number of potential missed games. ?

Formerly considered a noncontact sport, basketball has evolved into an activity where body contact has increased, resulting in more injuries. Orthopedic injuries predominate in basketball and will be the principal focus of this chapter. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal injuries. Findings at imaging directly impact clinical and surgical management and influence the time to return to play, particularly in high-level competitive athletes. Lower extremity injuries predominate in basketball, particularly at the knee, foot, and ankle, and will be the initial focus of this chapter. Injuries at the hip and pelvis, upper extremities, and in the spine and their respective findings at imaging will then be detailed. ?

However, limited evidence exists regarding the efficacy of this technique in enhancing joint stability and neuromuscular control. Objective: To determine how Kinesio Tape application to the ankle joint alters forces and muscle activity during a Drop-Jump maneuver. Design: Single-Group Pretest- Posttest. Setting: University laboratory. Subjects: 22 healthy adults with no previous history of ankle injury. Interventions: Participants were instrumented with electromyography on the Lower-leg muscles as theyL jumped from a 35-cm platform onto force plates. Test trials were performed without tape (BL), immediately after application of Kinesio Tape to the ankle (KT-I), and after 24 h of continued use (KT-24). Main Outcome Measures: Peak Ground-Reaction forces (GRFs) and time to peak GRF were compared across taping conditions, and the timing and amplitude of muscle activity from the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and lateral gastrocnemius were compared across taping conditions. Results: No significant differences in amplitude or timing of GRFs were observed (P >.05). However, muscle activity was observed to decrease from BL to KT-I in the tibialis anterior (P=.027) and from BL to KT-24 in the PL (P=.022). Conclusions: The data suggest that Kinesio Tape decreases muscle activity in the ankle during a Drop-Jump maneuver, although no changes in GRFs were observed. This is contrary to the proposed mechanisms of Kinesio Tape. Further research might investigate how this affects participants with a history of injury. ? 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2014-0221,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

Objective: To determine the effects of prophylactic ankle-brace use during a high school basketball season on dynamic postural control and functional tests. Design: Prospective repeated-measures design. Setting: High school athletic facility. Participants: 21 healthy high school basketball athletes (13 girls, 8 boys). Interventions: The order of testing was randomized using the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) for posteromedial (PM), medial (M), and anteromedial (AM) directions and 3 functional tests (FT) consisting of the single-leg crossover hop, single-leg vertical jump, and the single-leg 6-m hop for time at pre-, mid-, and postseason. After pretesting, the ankle brace was worn on both limbs during the entire 16-wk competitive basketball season. Main Outcome Measures: SEBT for PM, M, and AM and 3 single-leg FTs. Results: Dynamic postural control using the SEBT and the 3 FTs improved over time, notably from pretest to posttest. The left limb was different from the right limb during the single-leg vertical jump. Effect sizes were large for pretest to posttest for the 3 SEBT directions and 2 of the 3 FTs. Conclusions: The 16-wk basketball prophylactic ankle-brace intervention significantly improved dynamic postural control and single-limb FTs over time. ? 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.2013-0152,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

Objective: To assess the effects of FAJC on H-reflexes of the soleus and fibularis longus during 3 body positions (prone, bipedal, and unipedal stances) in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI). Design: Crossover. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: 15 young adults with CAI (9 male, 6 female) and 15 healthy controls. Intervention: All subjects received both FAJC and sham treatments on separate days in a randomized order. FAJC was accomplished by applying a 1.5-L plastic bag filled with crushed ice to the ankle for 20 min. Sham treatment involved room-temperature candy corn. Main Outcome Measures: Maximum amplitudes of H-reflexes and motor (M) waves were recorded while subjects lay prone and then stood in quiet bipedal and unipedal stances before and immediately after each treatment. Primary outcome measures were H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratios for the soleus and fibularis longus. Three-factor (group ? treatment condition ? time) repeated-measures ANOVAs and Fisher LSD tests were performed for statistical analyses. Results: Significant interactions of treatment condition by time for prone H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratios were found in the soleus (P = .001) and fibularis longus (P = .003). In both muscles, prone H<inf>max</inf>:M<inf>max</inf> ratios moderately increased after FAJC but not after sham treatment. The CAI and healthy groups responded similarly to FAJC. In contrast, there were no significant interactions or main effects in the bipedal and unipedal stances in either muscle (P > .05). Conclusions: FAJC moderately increased H-reflex amplitudes of the soleus and fibularis longus while subjects were prone but not during bipedal or unipedal standing.

(2015),2015,Anatomy and Biomechanics of the Posterolateral and Posteromedial Corners of the Knee and Their Surgical Implications,"Injuries to the posterolateral and posteromedial corners of the knee are common and represent a significant diagnostic and treatment challenge. A thorough understanding of posterolateral and posteromedial knee anatomy and biomechanics is paramount for accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients with medial and lateral knee injuries. In the posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee, the primary static stabilizers include the fibular (lateral) collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL). Together, these structures function to resist varus gapping and angulation, external rotation, internal rotation, and anterior translation. In the posteromedial knee, the primary structures include the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), deep medial collateral ligament (dMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL). These structures function to resist valgus gapping, internal rotation, and external rotation. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight recent advances in the understanding of posterolateral and posteromedial corner anatomy and biomechanics and their surgical implications. ?

(2014),2014,Viscoelastic response of the lateral side of the ankle to cyclic inversion: A time course analysis,"Although important, viscoelastic behavior of the ankle's lateral side has rarely been studied. The present study assesses the viscoelastic behavior during cyclic inversions. Eighteen recreationally active healthy males underwent 40 passive cyclic inversions using a Biodex dynamometer at 5ø/s through 80% of maximum range of motion. Energy absorption and restitution and dissipation coefficient were calculated for each repetition. Changes in the mean of the dependent variables for repetitions 1 (R<inf>1</inf>), R<inf>5</inf>, R<inf>10</inf>, R<inf>15</inf>, R<inf>20</inf>, R<inf>25</inf>, R<inf>30</inf>, R<inf>35</inf> and R<inf>40</inf> were compared by three one-way analyses of variance with repeated measures. There was a significant difference between the means of energy absorption for the selected repetitions from R<inf>1</inf> to R<inf>20</inf> (P<0.01), but there was no significant difference between them from R<inf>20</inf> to R<inf>40</inf> (P>0.05). There was no significant difference between the means of energy restitution for the selected repetitions (P>0.05). Whereas there was no significant difference consecutively between the means of dissipative coefficient for the selected repetitions (P>0.05), there was a significant difference between the means of R<inf>30</inf> or R<inf>40</inf> relative to the baseline (P<0.005). The decrease in the energy absorbed and the dissipation coefficient following repeated inversions may be due to the slippage of collagen fibers. The decrease in the shock absorbing ability of the tissues may expose them to injury. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, research has not observed cortical responses to joint loading or sensory changes in the context of joint laxity following injury.Methods: Forty-two subjects were stratified into healthy (CON), unstable (UNS), and coper (COP) groups using ankle injury and instability history. Event-related desynchronization (%) from electroencephalography quantified somatosensory cortex activity as the ankle was loaded using an arthrometer.Results: Cortical activation increased as the ankle was loaded (Fÿ=ÿ63.05, pÿ<ÿ0.001), but did not differ between groups (Fÿ=ÿ1.387, pÿ=ÿ0.268), despite greater laxity in UNS (Fÿ=ÿ3.58, pÿ=ÿ0.038).Conclusions: Increased somatosensory cortex activity was observed with joint loading; however, though UNS demonstrated a degree of mechanical instability, no differences in magnitude of cortical activation were observed. Continued research should explore how the relationship between cortical activation and joint stiffness is affected following ligamentous injury. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,10.1007/s00421-014-2929-3,European Journal of Applied Physiology

Used rhesus and Japanese monkeys consisted of 9 males and 22 females, ranging in age from newborn to 31 years (average age = 10.4 ñ 10.9 years). After incineration with nitric acid and perchloric acid, element contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. It was found that the P content decreased significantly in the LCFs of monkeys with aging, but other six element contents, Ca, S, Mg, Zn, Fe, and Na, did not change significantly with aging. Assuming that the P content indicated the active cell density and the S content indicated the protein amount, an age-related change of the mass ratio of P/S was examined in the LCFs. The mass ratio of P/S decreased significantly in the LCFs in childhood. Regarding the relationships among elements, significant direct correlations were found among the Ca, P, S, and Mg contents in the LCFs. It was suggested that the active cell density of the connective tissue cells might decrease significantly in the LCF in childhood. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Scopus,10.1007/s12011-014-0074-9,Biological Trace Element Research

(2014),2014,"Posterolateral instabilities of the knee joint: Anatomy, biomechanics and treatment; Posterolaterale Instabilit„ten des Kniegelenks: Anatomie, Biomechanik und Therapie","Background: Lateral and posterolateral injuries of the knee joint are frequent causes of instability and often occur in combination with injuries to other ligamentous structures, especially the posterior cruciate ligament. Knowledge of all anatomical structures and their respective functions are essential for understanding the diagnostics and treatment of acute and chronic instability of the posterolateral corner (PLC).Function: The PLC is the primary stabilizer of external tibial rotation and varus opening of the knee joint and functions as a secondary stabilizer for posterior tibial translation together with the posterior cruciate ligament.Diagnostics: A thorough clinical examination allows differentiation of the injuries of the respective structures of the PLC. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination is especially helpful in acute injuries while stress x-rays can add important information in the diagnostics of chronic instability. Arthroscopy can be warranted in detecting intra-articular injuries of the PLC when clinical and imaging analyses are inconclusive.Therapy: Conservative therapy has a limited relevance as injuries of the PLC are often complex and combined with cruciate ligament injuries. Repair, readaptation or bony refixation of impaired posterolateral structures are indicated in acute injuries only. With excessive instability, additional augmentation might be warranted. Chronic instability should be addressed either by anatomical or isometric reconstruction of the PLC. Most importantly, all additional instabilities of the knee joint must be restored simultaneously to ensure mid-term and long-term function and prevent secondary dysfunction of the knee joint. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,10.1007/s00142-014-0817-9,Arthroskopie

(2014),2014,Free hamstrings tendon transfer and interference screw fixation for less invasive reconstruction of chronic avulsions of the achilles tendon,"Chronic avulsions of the Achilles tendon from the calcaneus are infrequent [1, 13, 19, 26]. Achilles sleeve avulsions are a surgical challenge, as the Achilles tendon sleeves from its insertion into the calcaneus leaving virtually no tendinous tissue on the posterior calcaneus to facilitate a repair to the free end of the Achilles tendon [22]. So reconstruction of chronic avulsions of the Achilles tendon can be technically difficult. Hence can be necessary a tendon graft because may be not possible to directly reattach the Achilles tendon. The free hamstrings tendon transfer and interference screw fixation for less invasive reconstruction of chronic avulsions of the Achilles tendon is less invasive technique using a free semitendinosus tendon graft with interference screw fixation in the calcaneus through a Cincinnati incision. This approach permits a wide exposure of the insertion of the Achilles tendon, preserving the integrity of the skin overlying the site most decreasing the risk of wound breakdown. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

Moreover, in the chronic case with tendon shortening, operative repair can be more difficult than acute rupture. It is particularly desirable to reinforce the tendons, in addition to performing primary repair, in patients with renal or systemic diseases because of the accelerated collagen degeneration. Many techniques have been described for the surgical management of Achilles tendon rupture; however, none has shown clear superiority. We report the case of a 50-year-old renal transplant patient with a spontaneous distal Achilles tendon injury that we repaired using the pull-out technique reinforced with an autologous semitendinosus graft. At 2years postoperatively, the ankle-hindfoot scale score was 92 points, and the postoperative course was without complication. We believe that the free hamstring tendon autograft is advantageous for this repair, because it is easy to handle, has limited donor site morbidity, and preserves the structures around the ankle. ? 2014 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.",Scopus,10.1053/j.jfas.2013.12.010,Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery

Study Design: Ex vivo mechanical testing study. Sample Population: Canine PLT segments (n=21 dogs; 42 PLT). Methods: Morphometric measurements of PLT segments were taken from computed tomography (CT) images and compared with results obtained using calipers. PLT were tested to failure at a rate of 100%length/s. Mechanical properties and failure mode were recorded. Results: PLT width and thickness (P<.001 for both) measured by calipers were significantly lower than those taken from CT images. Thirty-five (83%) specimens failed by avulsion fracture from the patella, 1 failed mid-ligament, and 6 failed by tibial fracture. Dog weight and PLT length had the strongest Pearson's r value when correlated with load at failure (r=0.73, 0.81, respectively). Conclusion: Dog weight and PLT length were the best predictors of load at failure.

The current methods of repair ultilise autografts, allografts or xenografts, although each method has distinct disadvantages that limit their success. Decellularisation of harvested tissues has been previously investigated for sinew repair with the long-term aim of repopulating the structure with autologous cells. Although this procedure shows promise, the demand for donor scaffolds will always outweigh supply. Here, we report the fabrication of fibrin-based tissue-engineered sinews, which can be decellularised, dehydrated and stored. The sinews may then be rehydrated and repopulated with an autologous cell population. In addition to enabling production of patient-specific implants, interestingly, the process of combined decellularisation, dehydration and rehydration enhanced the mechanical properties of the sinew. The treated sinews exhibited a 2.6-fold increase in maximum load and 8-fold increase in ultimate tensile strength when compared with the control group (p < 0.05 in both cases). ? 2014, ?

Electrodiagnostic studies, radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging studies, and sonographic evaluation may assist with the diagnosis of these disorders. Initial treatment usually involves conservative measures, but surgical intervention may be required if conservative treatment fails.

Interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess reliability for absolute agreement and internal consistency between baseline and 2 follow-up sessions at 14 and 28 d postbaseline. Each ICC was fit with the best-fit straight line or parabola to smooth out noise in the observations and best determine if a pattern existed in determining the most reliable MEP value. Results: All muscles yielded strong ICCs between baseline and both time points for AMT. MEPs in both the quadriceps and FL produced varying degrees of reliability, with the greatest reliability demonstrated on day 28 at 130% and 140% of AMT in the quadriceps and FL, respectively. The dominant FL muscle showed a significant pattern; as TMS intensity increased, MEP reliability increased. Conclusion: TMS can be used to reliably identify corticomotor alterations after therapeutic interventions, as well as monitor disease progression. ? 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/JSR.2013-0069,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

(2014),2014,"The immediate effects of an anterior-to-posterior talar mobilization on neural excitability, dorsiflexion range of motion, and dynamic balance in patients with chronic ankle instability","Context: Altered neuromuscular function and decreased dorsiflexion range of motion (DFROM) have been observed in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Joint mobilizations are indicated for restoring DFROM and dynamic postural control, yet it remains unknown if a mobilization can alter neuromuscular excitability in muscles surrounding the ankle. Objective: To determine the immediate effects of a Maitland grade III anterior-to-posterior joint mobilization on spinal-reflex and corticospinal excitability in the fibularis longus (FL) and soleus (SOL), DFROM, and dynamic postural control. Design: Single-blinded randomized control trial. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients: 30 patients with CAI randomized into a mobilization (n = 15) or control (n = 15) group. Intervention: Maitland grade III anterior-to-posterior joint mobilization. Main Outcome Measures: Spinal-reflex excitability was measured with the Hoffmann reflex, while corticospinal excitability was evaluated with transcranial magnetic stimulation. DFROM was measured seated with the knee extended, and dynamic postural control was quantified with the Star Excursion Balance Test. Separate 2 ? 2 repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed for each outcome measure. Dependent t tests were used to evaluate individual differences within groups in the presence of significance. Results: Spinal-reflex and corticospinal excitability of the SOL and FL were not altered in the mobilization or control group (P >.05). DFROM increased immediately after the mobilization (P =.05) but not in the control group, while dynamic postural control was unchanged in both groups (P >.05). Conclusion: A single joint-mobilization treatment was efficacious at restoring DFROM in participants with CAI; however, excitability of spinal reflex and corticospinal pathways at the ankle and dynamic postural control were unaffected. ? 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/JSR.2013-0085,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation
1489,SC-872,Feger et al. (2014),2014,Lower Extremity Muscle Activation During Functional Exercises in Patients With and Without Chronic Ankle Instability,"Objective: To determine whether individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) exhibit altered neuromuscular control as demonstrated by surface electromyography (EMG) amplitudes compared with healthy controls during single-limb eyes-closed balance, Star Excursion Balance Test, forward lunge, and lateral hop exercises. Design: A cross-sectional laboratory study. Setting: A research laboratory. Participants: Fifteen young adults with CAI and 15 healthy controls. Interventions: The subjects performed functional exercises while surface EMG signals were recorded from the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, lateral gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and gluteus medius. Main Outcome Measurements: Surface EMG amplitudes (root mean square area) for each muscle, muscles of the shank (distal 3 muscles), muscles of the thigh (proximal 3muscles), and total muscle activity (all 6 muscles) of the lower extremity were analyzed and compared between the groups. Results: Individuals with CAI demonstrated significantly less EMG activity in the muscles of the lower extremity during all 4 functional exercises. Effect sizes for significant differences between groups ranged from-0.75 to-1.08, none of which had 95% confidence intervals that crossed zero, which indicates moderate to large decreases in muscle activity in patients with CAI compared with healthy controls. Conclusions: Patients with CAI demonstrated decreased muscle activity of ankle, knee, and hip musculature during common functional rehabilitative tasks. Clinicians may benefit from implementing functional exercises for patients with CAI that target both distal and proximal muscles of the lower extremity. ? 2014 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.",Scopus,10.1016/j.pmrj.2013.12.013,PM and R

(2014),2014,Ankle muscle function during preferred and non-Preferred 45ø directional cutting in semi-professional basketball players,"No research has analysed the influence of ankle muscle activity for joint mobility and stability on preferred directional cutting. Twelve basketballers completed the Y-Shaped agility test, requiring 45ø cuts to the left or right, to assess planned and reactive cutting. In planned conditions, participants knew the cutting direction. In reactive conditions, participants responded to a randomly illuminated gate. Legs were defined as the outside (furthest from target gate) or inside (closest to target gate) cut legs. The preferred outside cutting leg was determined from the fastest planned cut. Electromyography measured peak normalised (against 10- meter sprint performance) activity of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus (PL), peroneus brevis (PB), and soleus. Paired t-Tests (p > 0.05) compared preferred and non-preferred cutting legs; effect sizes (d) were calculated. There were no differences in muscle activity between the preferred and non-preferred legs in the planned (p = 0.218-0.828) or reactive (p = 0.092- 0.862) cuts. There were moderate effects for a 28% higher PL (d = 0.51), and 27% lower PB (d = 0.57) activity, for the reactive outside cut leg. Due to the synergistic nature of these muscles, there was likely no effect to agility.

Although the benefits are well established, ankle arthroscopy is associated with a definite risk of complications, especially neurological. The incidence rate of vascular complication after anterior ankle arthroscopy has been reported. Methods: we review the literature on vascular complications after anterior ankle arthroscopy especially pseudoaneurysm and a case report of a peronal artery pseudoaneurysm was reported. Conclusion: vascular complications after an anterior ankle arthroscopy are extremely rare but orthopaedic surgeons should be wary of this chance.

It can facilitate the connectivity and collaboration of people, organizations, and societies. We believe that Information Systems scholars are in a unique position to make significant contributions to this emerging research area and consider it as a new research frontier. However, so far, few studies have elaborated what have been achieved and what should be done. This paper seeks to present a critical examination of the substrate of crowdsourcing research by surveying the landscape of existing studies, including theoretical foundations, research methods, and research foci, and identifies several important research directions for IS scholars from three perspectives - the participant, organization, and system - and which warrant further study.

In unrecognized distal rupture of the syndosmosis and malunion of the distal fibula; Chronische obere sprunggelenkinstabilit„t. Bei nicht erkannter distaler syndesmosenruptur und malunion der fibulaspitze,"Background. It is often difficult in the acute phase to diagnose a lesion of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. If this lesion is over looked, the patient will develop an incongruity of the upper ankle joint with a pathological external rotation of the talus. The risk of a possible premature arthritis is clearly in creased. Objectives. In this case study a distal rupture of the syndesmosis in a young patient was overlooked in the initial diagnostic work-up. Methods. A search of the relevant literature and a case report. Results. In the case described the shortened fibula and chronic instability of the tibiofibular syndesmosis were repaired with a lengthening and derotational osteotomy and reconstruction using the gracilis muscle tendon. Through this method an exact reconstruction of the normal anatomy could be achieved. Conclusion. Posttraumatic misalignment in the ankle joint is associated with a high risk of secondary degenerative lesions. In cases with suspicion of a syndesmosis lesion, confirmation of the diagnosis is imperative so as to perform an anatomic repositioning and reconstruction of stability. ?

(2014),2014,"Foot posture is associated with morphometry of the peroneus longus muscle, tibialis anterior tendon, and Achilles tendon","The aim of this study was to investigate the association between foot type and the morphometry of selected muscles and tendons of the lower limb. Sixty-one healthy participants (31 male, 30 female aged 27.1ñ8.8 years) underwent gray-scale musculoskeletal ultrasound examination to determine the anterior-posterior (AP) thickness of tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus muscles and tendons as well as the Achilles tendon. Foot type was classified based on arch height and footprint measurements. Potentially confounding variables (height, weight, hip and waist circumference, rearfoot and ankle joint range of motion, and levels of physical activity) were also measured. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine the association between foot type with muscle and tendon morphometry accounting for potentially confounding variables. Foot type was significantly and independently associated with AP thickness of the tibialis anterior tendon, peroneus longus muscle, and Achilles tendon, accounting for approximately 7% to 16% of the variation. Flat-arched feet were associated with a thicker tibialis anterior tendon, a thicker peroneus longus muscle, and a thinner Achilles tendon. Foot type is associated with morphometry of tendons that control sagittal plane motion of the rearfoot; and the peroneus longus muscle that controls frontal plane motion of the rearfoot. These findings may be related to differences in tendon loading during gait. ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Scopus,10.1111/sms.12025,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports

(2014),2014,"Radiographic, histologic, and arthroscopic findings in amorphous calcifications of the hip labrum","Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical, radiographic, histologic, and intraoperative findings of an amorphous calcification involving the acetabular labrum. Methods From October 2008 to April 2013, all patients who underwent arthroscopic hip surgery for symptomatic intra-articular hip disorders and were found to have the characteristic calcific deposit involving the acetabular labrum were included. These patients were reviewed retrospectively on prospectively collected data. Radiographs were retrospectively evaluated for morphologic features of impingement and characteristics of labral calcification. Results Sixteen patients were identified as having amorphous calcification at the time of arthroscopy. There were 15 women and 1 man. Mean age was 37.3 years (range, 30 to 50 years). Symptoms were present for a mean of 9.3 months (range, 3 to 48 months). All patients reported anterior groin pain. Fifteen (94%) patients had positive anterior impingement and 9 (56%) had positive results for lateral impingement. Calcifications measured on average 3.2 mm (range, 1.9 mm to 5.6 mm), and 14 had a clear separation from the rim with increased opacity compared with neighboring trabecular bone. Intraoperatively, the characteristic amorphous calcium deposit was located in the anterosuperior labrum, with the deposit found to be accessible from the capsule-labral recess in all cases. All patients had labral tears and all patients had at least one component of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Conclusions Calcification in the anterosuperior acetabular labrum presents with a consistent patient demographic and distinct radiographic and arthroscopic presentation that is different from os acetabuli. As with os acetabuli, one should have a high suspicion for FAI when this lesion is encountered.

1497,SC-880,Minshull et al. (2014),2014,The differential effects of PNF versus passive stretch conditioning on neuromuscular performance,"The effects of flexibility conditioning on neuromuscular and sensorimotor performance were assessed near to full knee extension (25ø). Eighteen males who were randomly assigned into two groups underwent eight weeks (three-times per week) of flexibility conditioning (hip region/knee flexor musculature; dominant limb) involving either proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) (n=9) or passive stretching (PASS) (n=9). Both modes of flexibility conditioning are popular within contemporary exercise and clinical settings and have demonstrated efficacy in improving range of motion. The contralateral limb and a prior 'no exercise' condition were used as controls. The PNF and PASS modes of conditioning improved passive hip flexibility to a similar extent (mean 19.3% vs. baseline, intervention limb, p<0.01) but did not alter knee flexor strength (overall mean 309.6ñ81 N) or sensorimotor performance (force and positional errors: 2.3ñ8.2% and 0.48ñ7.1%). Voluntary and magnetically evoked electromechanical delays (EMD<inf>V</inf> and EMD<inf>E</inf>, respectively) were increased but to a greater extent following PASS compared to PNF (PASS: 10.8% and 16.9% lengthening of EMD<inf>V</inf> and EMD<inf>E</inf>, respectively vs. PNF: 3.2% and 6.2%, p<0.01).The attenuated change to electromechanical delay (EMD) performance during PNF conditioning suggests a preserved capability for rapid muscle activation, which is important in the maintenance of dynamic joint stability. That PNF was also equally efficacious in flexibility conditioning would suggest that this mode of flexibility training should be used over passive to help preserve dynamic joint stability capabilities at this extended and vulnerable joint position. ? 2013 ? 2013 European College of Sport Science.",Scopus,10.1080/17461391.2013.799716,European Journal of Sport Science
1498,SC-881,Borreani et al. (2014),2014,Exercise intensity progression for exercises performed on unstable and stable platforms based on ankle muscle activation,"Ankle sprains are a common sports injury. The literature focuses on the application of neuromuscular training for the improvement of balance, injury prevention and rehabilitation. However, there is a dearth of knowledge about the appropriate prescription of exercises using unstable platforms and surfaces. The purpose of this study was to devise an ankle rehabilitation or training program with exercise progression based on the extent of muscle activation, employing platforms with different levels of stability and additional resistance. A descriptive study of electromyography (EMG) during ankle exercises was performed with a convenience sample of healthy subjects. Forty-four subjects completed 12 exercises performed in a random order. Exercises were performed unipedally or bipedally with or without elastic tubing as resistance on various unstable (uncontrolled multiaxial and uniaxial movement) and stable surfaces. Surface EMG from the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL) and soleus (SOL) were collected to quantify the amount of muscle activity. Significant differences were found between exercise conditions for PL (p<001), TA (p=011), and SOL (p<001). The greatest EMG activity for all muscles occurred with an upright unipedal stance on a soft stability surface with resistance. The least EMG activity for the TA and SOL were in a seated position and for the PL in an erect bipedal position without resistance. Based on the level of ankle muscle activation, exercises for the ankle should progress from bilateral exercises on exercise balls (lowest intensity), to a unipedal position on a soft surface in combination with elastic tubing (highest intensity) in order to achieve progressively greater ankle muscle activation. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.08.006,Gait and Posture

1500,SC-883,Karimi et al. (2013),2013,Gait analysis of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed subjects with a combined tendon obtained from hamstring and peroneus longus,"Background: Stability of the knee joint is achieved by a complex process in which the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays an important role. The rupture of this ligament is quite frequent especially in athletic young subjects. Various methods have been used to reconstruct the ACL. One of the new methods is to use a graft combined from peroneus longus and hamstring. As there is no evidence regarding this method, it was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this method. Method: Two groups of normal and those with ACL injury, in whom their ACLs were reconstructed with the new method, participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking on level surface were evaluated by a motion analysis system (Qualysis) and a Kistler force plate. The difference between the parameters of operated and non-operated sides and also between patients and normal subjects was evaluated by use of a two sample t test (p-value was 0.05). Results: The results of this study showed that the pattern and magnitude of the loads transmitted by lower extrimity joints differed between normal and ACL reconstructed subjects. The sound side pattern and magnitude of motion were also influenced by ACL insufficiency. Conclusions: The results of the current study showed that the reconstructed ACL by use of this method did not have enough performance to restore the function of the leg. As the knee joint is unstable following the use of this method, it is recommended to find a new method of ACL reconstruction to improve the function of this ligament after reconstruction. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.knee.2013.07.007,Knee
1501,SC-884,Rosen et al. (2013),2013,Differences in lateral drop jumps from an unknown height among individuals with functional ankle instability,"Context: Functional ankle instability (FAI) is a debilitating condition that has been reported to occur after 20% to 50% of all ankle sprains. Landing from a jump is one common mechanism of ankle injury, yet few researchers have explored the role of visual cues and anticipatory muscle contractions, which may influence ankle stability, in lateral jumping maneuvers. Objective: To examine muscle-activation strategies between FAI and stable ankles under a lateral load and to evaluate the differences in muscle activation in participants with FAI and participants with stable ankles when they were unable to anticipate the onset of lateral loads during eyes-open versus eyes-closed conditions. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Controlled laboratory setting. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 40 people participated: 20 with FAI and 20 healthy, uninjured, sex- and age-matched persons (control group). Intervention(s): Participants performed a 2-legged lateral jump off a platform onto a force plate set to heights of 35 cm or 50 cm and then immediately jumped for maximal height. They performed jumps in 2 conditions (eyes open, eyes closed) and were unaware of the jump height when their eyes were closed. Main Outcome Measure(s): Amplitude normalized electromyographic (EMG) area (%), peak (%), and time to peak in the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles were measured. Results: Regardless of the eyes-open or eyes-closed condition, participants with FAI had less preparatory TA (t158 = 2.22, P = .03) and PL (t158 = 2.09, P = .04) EMG area and TA (t158 = 2.45, P = .02) and PL (t158 = 2.17, P = .03) peak EMG than control-group participants. Conclusions: By removing visual cues, unanticipated lateral joint loads occurred simultaneously with decreased muscle activity, which may reduce dynamic restraint capabilities in persons with FAI. Regardless of visual impairment and jump height, participants with FAI exhibited PL and TA inhibition, which may limit talonavicular stability and intensify lateral joint surface compression and pain. ? by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.",Scopus,10.4085/1062-6050-48.5.05,Journal of Athletic Training

1503,SC-886,Terada et al. (2013),2013,Effects of chronic ankle instability on energy dissipation in the lower extremity,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the influence of chronic ankle instability (CAI) on lower extremity joint energy dissipation patterns during a stop-jump task. METHODS: Nineteen participants with self-reported CAI and 19 healthy control participants volunteered. Participants performed five double-leg vertical stop-jump tasks onto a force plate. Lower extremity kinetics and kinematics were examined with an electromagnetic tracking system interfaced with a nonconductive force plate. Lower extremity joint energy dissipations were calculated for the hip, knee, and ankle in the sagittal plane during 50, 100, 150, and 200 ms after initial contact with the force plate. Energy dissipation values were normalized to the product of body mass and height [Jú(Núm)]. Individual joint contribution to total lower extremity energy dissipation by the ankle, knee, and hip was reported as the percentage of energy dissipation by each joint over the total energy dissipation of all three joints. Independent t-tests and standard mean differences were conducted to assess differences in each dependent variable between the CAI and the control groups. Significance was set a priori at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The CAI group demonstrated significantly less percentage of knee energy dissipation (P = 0.04) and higher percentage of ankle energy dissipation (P = 0.035) of the total energy dissipation during the 100 ms immediately after initial contact compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: We found altered energy dissipation patterns at the knee and ankle during a stop-jump task in the CAI group. These findings may provide insight into kinetic alterations that may be associated with CAI. Future research should consider this information as it may be used to develop more effective interventions to target these potentially modifiable energy dissipation patterns in those with CAI.

1504,SC-887,Li et al. (2013),2013,Strength of suture anchor versus transosseous tunnel in anatomic reconstruction of the ankle lateral ligaments: A biomechanical study,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical characteristics of fixation with 2-suture anchors versus transosseous tunnel fixation in anatomic reconstruction of the ankle lateral ligaments. Methods Six matched pairs of human cadaveric ankles underwent anatomic lateral ankle reconstruction, and fixation of the graft on the talus was achieved with 2 suture anchors or a transosseous tunnel. Ankles for the transosseous tunnel group were chosen at random, with the paired contralateral ankles used for the 2-suture anchor group. Half of the peroneus brevis tendon was harvested as a graft. For each technique, one end of the tendon was secured to the original insertion point of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) at the talus, whereas the other end was armed with 2 No. 5 nonabsorbable sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) and passed through the bone tunnel in the fibula. Biomechanical testing was performed by applying the force in line with the graft. Load to failure was determined at a displacement rate of 50 mm/min. The load-displacement curve, maximum load at failure (N), and stiffness (N/mm) were recorded and compared between the 2 techniques. Results There was no difference between constructs in the 2-suture anchor group and the transosseous tunnel group in terms of the ultimate load and stiffness (161.8 ñ 47.6 N v 171.9 ñ 76.0 N; P =.92; 4.59 ñ 1.85 N/mm v 5.77 ñ 1.98 N/mm; P =.35). Most constructs failed because of anchor pullout in the 2-suture anchor group (5 of 6) and fracture of the bony bridge in the transosseous tunnel group (6 of 6). Conclusions The strength of fixation with suture anchors in anatomic reconstruction of the ankle lateral ligaments was equivalent to transosseous tunnel fixation as determined with biomechanical testing. However, this study did not prove that one is advantageous over the other. Clinical Relevance Both techniques showed excellent biomechanical results. Therefore, the 2-suture anchor fixation approach can be safely used in anatomic reconstruction of the ankle lateral ligaments. ? 2013 The Arthroscopy Association of North America.

1505,SC-888,Krishnan et al. (2013),2013,A Pilot Study on the Feasibility of Robot-Aided Leg Motor Training to Facilitate Active Participation,"Robot-aided gait therapy offers a promising approach towards improving gait function in individuals with neurological disorders such as stroke or spinal cord injury. However, incorporation of appropriate control strategies is essential for actively engaging the patient in the therapeutic process. Although several control algorithms (such as assist-as-needed and error augmentation) have been proposed to improve active patient participation, we hypothesize that the therapeutic benefits of these control algorithms can be greatly enhanced if combined with a motor learning task to facilitate neural reorganization and motor recovery. Here, we describe an active robotic training approach (patient-cooperative robotic gait training combined with a motor learning task) using the Lokomat and pilot-tested whether this approach can enhance active patient participation during training. Six neurologically intact adults and three chronic stroke survivors participated in this pilot feasibility study. Participants walked in a Lokomat while simultaneously performing a foot target-tracking task that necessitated greater hip and knee flexion during the swing phase of the gait. We computed the changes in tracking error as a measure of motor performance and changes in muscle activation as a measure of active subject participation. Repeated practice of the motor-learning task resulted in significant reductions in target-tracking error in all subjects. Muscle activation was also significantly higher during active robotic training compared to simply walking in the robot. The data from stroke participants also showed a trend similar to neurologically intact participants. These findings provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that combining robotic gait training with a motor learning task enhances active participation. ? 2013 Krishnan et al.",Scopus,10.1371/journal.pone.0077370,PLOS ONE

(2013),2013,The influence of freezing on the tensile strength of tendon grafts: A biomechanical study,"We investigated the influence of freezing on the tensile strength of fresh frozen tendon grafts. The biomechanical characteristics of tendons that are less commonly used in knee surgery (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus and medial and lateral half of Achilles tendons) were compared to those of a semitendinosus and gracilis graft harvested from the same 10 multi-organ donors. All right side tendons constituted the study group and were frozen at '80øC and thawed at room temperature 5 times. All left side tendons were frozen at '80øC and thawed at room temperature once. There were 59 tendons in the control group and 56 in the study group. The looped grafts were clamped at one side using a custom-made freeze clamp and loaded until failure on an Instron 4505 testing machine. The average ultimate failure load was not significantly different between the control and the study group (p > 0.05). The failure load of the medial tendon Achilles was the lowest in both study and control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness between the control and study group (p > 0.05). From our study, we conclude that freezing tendons at '80øC and thawing several times does not influence the maximum load, maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness. The medial half of the Achilles tendon is clearly the weakest tendon (p < 0.001). These findings show that tendon grafts can be frozen at '80øC and thawed at room temperature several times without altering their biomechanical properties. ? 2013, Acta Orthop‘dica Belgica.",Scopus,0,Acta Orthopaedica Belgica

(2013),2013,Unilateral balance training enhances neuromuscular reactions to perturbations in the trained and contralateral limb,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of unilateral balance training on the reactive recovery of balance for both trained and untrained limbs. Twenty-three subjects were randomly assigned to either a control group (CG) or a training group (TG). The latter performed six weeks of balance training for the right leg. The pre- and post-training measurements were based on single leg standing posture on a moveable force platform which moved 6cm anteriorly. TG subjects were tested on the trained (TR) and untrained leg (UTR), whereas CG subjects were tested on the right leg (CTR). The center of pressure trajectory length (CP<inf>LEN</inf>) and average speed (CP<inf>SPD</inf>) as well as onsets of muscular activation and time to peak (EMG<inf>TP</inf>) from lower limb muscles were calculated and compared by a 2-way ANOVA (three legs?two training status). Muscular onsets were reduced after training for TR (~19ms, p<0.05) and UTR (~17ms, p<0.05) with no significant changes for CTR. No effects of training for CP<inf>LEN</inf> and medial-lateral CP<inf>SPD</inf> were found. Furthermore, the EMG<inf>TP</inf> of UTR was predominantly greater before training (~17ms, p<0.05). However, after training the EMG<inf>TP</inf> was similar among limbs. These results suggest that concomitant with improved balance recovery and neuromuscular reactions in TR, there is also a cross-education effect in UTR, which might be predominantly related to supraspinal adaptations shared between interconnected structures in the brain. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.04.015,Gait and Posture
1509,SC-892,Mook et al. (2013),2013,Allograft reconstruction of peroneal tendons: Operative technique and clinical outcomes,"Background: Irreparable peroneal tendon tears are uncommon and require complex surgical decision making. Intercalary segment allograft reconstruction has been previously described as a treatment option; however, there are no reports of the outcomes of this technique in the literature. We describe our technique and present our results using this method. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify all patients who underwent intercalary allograft reconstruction of the peroneal tendons. Mechanism of injury, concomitant operative procedures, pertinent radiographic findings, pre- and postoperative physical examination, intercalary graft length, medical history, visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, Short Form-12 (SF-12) physical health survey, Lower Extremity Functional Score (LEFS), and complications were reviewed. Results: Fourteen patients with peroneal tendon ruptures requiring reconstruction were identified. Mean follow-up was 17 months (range, 7-47 months; median, 12 months). The average length of the intercalary segment reconstructed was 10.8 ñ 3.8 cm (range, 6-20 cm). The average postoperative VAS score decreased to 1.0 ñ 1.4 (P = .0005). No patient had a higher postoperative pain score than preoperative pain score. Average postoperative eversion strength as categorized by the Medical Research Council grading scale improved to 4.8 ñ 0.5 (P = .001). The average SF-12 score improved to 48.8 ñ 7.8 (P = .02). The average LEFS improved to 86.4. ñ 14.9 (P = .00001). Four patients experienced sensory numbness in the sural nerve distribution, and 2 of these were transient. There were no postoperative wound healing complications, infections, tendon reruptures, or reoperations. No allograft associated complications were encountered. All patients returned to their preinjury activity levels. Conclusion: Allograft reconstruction of the peroneal tendons can improve strength, decrease pain, and yield satisfactory patient-reported outcomes. It can be performed without incurring the deleterious effects associated with tendon transfer procedures. We believe that allograft reconstruction is a safe and useful alternative in the treatment of irreparable peroneal tendon ruptures.

1510,SC-893,Cimadoro et al. (2013),2013,Effects of different unstable supports on EMG activity and balance,"This study analysed the equilibrium strategies and EMG activity during postural equilibrium in four different unstable surfaces. Thirteen team sport males were tested on a FLAT surface and on three different wobble boards (JAKOBS? with easy multidirectional displacements, FREEMAN with strong multidirectional displacements and LATERAL with unidirectional lateral displacements). They had to maintain single-limb stance during 5s for each condition. The right foot centre of pressure (COP) position and its variability with concomitant EMG activity of soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL) and extensor digitorum longus (EXD) muscles were recorded. Subjects maintained balance by making seesaw rotations. LATERAL and FREEMAN boards demonstrated significantly greater COP variability than JAKOBS? and FLAT in both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. Similarly, PL, EXD, and TA muscles EMG activity were significantly greater using the LATERAL board, and in some cases using FREEMAN as compared with JAKOBS? and FLAT. These results highlighted new knowledge about central nervous system organisation while keeping equilibrium with a predominant anteroposterior control. ? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.neulet.2013.05.025,Neuroscience Letters
1511,SC-894,Yaman et al. (2013),2013,Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of mechanical interactions between human lower leg muscles in vivo,"Evidence on epimuscular myofascial force transmission (EMFT) was shown for undissected muscle in situ. We hypothesize that global length changes of gastrocnemius muscle-tendon complex in vivo will cause sizable and heterogeneous local strains within all muscles of the human lower leg. Our goal is to test this hypothesis. A method was developed and validated using high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance image sets and Demons nonrigid registration algorithm for performing large deformation analyses. Calculation of strain tensors per voxel in human muscles in vivo allowed quantifying local heterogeneous tissue deformations and volume changes. After hip and knee movement (D knee angle ? 25 deg) but without any ankle movement, local lengthening within m. gastrocnemius was shown to occur simultaneously with local shortening (maximally by +34.2% and -32.6%, respectively) at different locations. Moreover, similar local strains occur also within other muscles, despite being kept at constant muscle-tendon complex length. This is shown for synergistic m. soleus and deep flexors, as well as for antagonistic anterior crural and peroneal muscle groups: minimum peak lengthening and shortening equaled 23.3% and 25.54%, respectively despite global isometric conditions. These findings confirm our hypothesis and show that in vivo, muscles are in principle not independent mechanically.

(2013),2013,Gain modulation of the middle latency cutaneous reflex in patients with chronic joint instability after ankle sprain,"Objective: To investigate the neural alteration of reflex pathways arising from cutaneous afferents in patients with chronic ankle instability. Methods: Cutaneous reflexes were elicited by applying non-noxious electrical stimulation to the sural nerve of subjects with chronic ankle instability (n= 17) and control subjects (n= 17) while sitting. Electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from each ankle and thigh muscle. The middle latency response (MLR; latency: 70-120. ms) component was analyzed. Results: In the peroneus longus (PL) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles, linear regression analyses between the magnitude of the inhibitory MLR and background EMG activity showed that, compared to the uninjured side and the control subjects, the gain of the suppressive MLR was increased in the injured side. This was also confirmed by the pooled data for both groups. The degree of MLR alteration was significantly correlated to that of chronic ankle instability in the PL. Conclusions: The excitability of middle latency cutaneous reflexes in the PL and VL is modulated in subjects with chronic ankle instability. Significance: Cutaneous reflexes may be potential tools to investigate the pathological state of the neural system that controls the lower limbs in subjects with chronic ankle instability. ? 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",Scopus,10.1016/j.clinph.2013.01.029,Clinical Neurophysiology

1514,SC-897,Vie et al. (2013),2013,Changes in stationary upright standing and proprioceptive reflex control of foot muscles after fatiguing static foot inversion,"We searched for the consequences of a maximal static foot inversion sustained until exhaustion on the post-exercise stationary upright standing and the proprioceptive control of the foot muscles.Twelve healthy subjects executed an unilateral maximal static foot inversion during which continuous power spectrum analyses of surface electromyograms of the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscles were performed. Superimposed pulse trains (twitch interpolation) were delivered to the TA muscle to identify ""central"" or ""peripheral"" fatigue. Before and after the fatiguing task, we measured (1) the repartition of the plantar and barycentre surfaces with a computerized stationary platform, (2) the peak contractile TA response to electrical stimulation (TA twitch), (3) the tonic vibratory response (TVR) of TA and GM muscles, and (4) the Hoffman reflex.During static exercise, ""central"" fatigue was diagnosed in 5/12 subjects whereas in the 7 others ""peripheral"" TA fatigue was deduced from the absence of response to twitch interpolation and the post-exercise decrease in twitch amplitude. The sustained foot inversion was associated with reduced median frequency in TA but not in PL and GM muscles. After static exercise, in all subjects both the mean plantar and rearfoot surfaces increased, indicating a foot eversion, the TVR amplitude decreased in TA but did not vary in GM, and the Hoffman reflex remained unchanged.Whatever was the mechanism of fatigue during the maximal foot inversion task, the facilitating myotatic reflex was constantly altered in foot invertor muscles. This could explain the prevailing action of the antagonistic evertor muscles. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.04.005,Journal of Biomechanics
1515,SC-898,Bosworth et al. (2013),2013,Investigation of 2D and 3D electrospun scaffolds intended for tendon repair,"Two-dimensional (2D) electrospun fibre mats have been investigated as fibrous sheets intended as biomaterials scaffolds for tissue repair. It is recognised that tissues are three-dimensional (3D) structures and that optimisation of the fabrication process should include both 2D and 3D scaffolds. Understanding the relative merits of the architecture of 2D and 3D scaffolds for tendon repair is required. This study investigated three different electrospun scaffolds based on poly(î-caprolactone) fibres intended for repair of injured tendons, referred to as; 2D random sheet, 2D aligned sheet and 3D bundles. 2D aligned fibres and 3D bundles mimicked the parallel arrangement of collagen fibres in natural tendon and 3D bundles further replicated the tertiary layer of a tendon's hierarchical configuration. 3D bundles demonstrated greatest tensile properties, being significantly stronger and stiffer than 2D aligned and 2D random fibres. All scaffolds supported adhesion and proliferation of tendon fibroblasts. Furthermore, 2D aligned sheets and 3D bundles allowed guidance of the cells into a parallel, longitudinal arrangement, which is similar to tendon cells in the native tissue. With their superior physical properties and ability to better replicate tendon tissue, the 3D electrospun scaffolds warrant greater investigation as synthetic grafts in tendon repair. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Scopus,10.1007/s10856-013-4911-8,Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine
1516,SC-899,Jockel et al. (2013),2013,Single-stage flexor tendon transfer for the treatment of severe concomitant peroneus longus and brevis tendon tears,"Background: Although peroneal tendon injuries are a common cause of lateral ankle pain, there is a paucity of literature specifically addressing the treatment of severe concomitant peroneus longus and brevis tears. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient outcomes following a single-stage flexor tendon transfer for the treatment of severe concomitant tears of both peroneal tendons. Methods: Eight patients were treated with a single-stage flexor tendon transfer for severe concomitant peroneus longus and brevis tears over a 15-year period. Mean age at the time of surgery was 54 years (range, 41-67 years), including 4 male and 4 female patients. Tendon transfer of either the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) or flexor digitorum longus (FDL) was performed when both peroneal tendons were found intraoperatively to have severe nonreconstructable tears. Mean follow-up time from surgery was 58 months (range, 12-91 months). Preoperative and postoperative AOFAS hindfoot and visual analog pain scores were prospectively collected, and patient charts were reviewed for complications. A postoperative outcome questionnaire was administered during latest follow-up to assess return to activities, satisfaction, and self-rated patient outcome. Results: Mean pre- and postoperative AOFAS hindfoot scores increased from 64 (range, 54-77) to 86 (range, 69-100), whereas mean score for pain on a visual analog scale decreased from 4.2 (range, 0.5-6) to 0.7 (range, 0-3). One surgical complication occurred following FDL transfer in a patient who developed a transient peroneal nerve palsy, and 1 patient underwent a subsequent calcaneal osteotomy. Seven of 8 patients reported a return to preoperative activity levels, and no patient required bracing for activities of daily living. All patients reported satisfaction with surgical results, and 7 rated their outcomes as good or excellent. Conclusion: Single-stage flexor tendon transfer is an effective surgical option for the treatment of severe concomitant peroneus longus and brevis tendon tears.

1517,SC-900,Maffulli et al. (2013),2013,Minimally invasive reconstruction of chronic achilles tendon ruptures using the ipsilateral free semitendinosus tendon graft and interference screw fixation,"Background: Achilles tendon ruptures represent more than 40% of all tendon ruptures requiring surgical management. About 20% of acute Achilles tendon tears are not diagnosed at the time of injury and become chronic, necessitating more complicated management than fresh injuries. Several techniques for the reconstruction of chronic tears of the Achilles tendon have been described, but the superiority of one technique over the others has not been demonstrated. Hypothesis: Mini-invasive reconstruction of the Achilles tendon, with a gap lesion larger than 6 cm, using the ipsilateral free semitendinosus tendon graft will result in improvement of the overall function with a low rate of complications. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between 2008 and 2010, the authors prospectively enrolled 28 consecutive patients (21 men and 7 women; median age, 46 years) with chronic closed ruptures of the Achilles tendon who had undergone reconstruction with a free semitendinosus tendon graft. They assessed the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS), maximum calf circumference, and isometric plantarflexion strength before surgery and at the last follow-up. Outcome of surgery and rate of complications were also recorded. The median follow-up after surgery was 31.4 months. Results: The overall result of surgery was excellent/good in 26 (93%) of 28 patients. The ATRS improved from 42 (range, 29-55) to 86 (range, 78-95) (P < .0001). In the operated leg, the maximum calf circumference and isometric plantarflexion strength were significantly improved after surgery (P < .0001); however, their values remained significantly lower than those of the opposite side (P < .0001). All patients were able to walk on tiptoes and returned to their preinjury working occupation. No infections were recorded. Conclusion: Mini-invasive reconstruction of the Achilles tendon, with a gap lesion larger than 6 cm, using the ipsilateral free semitendinosus tendon graft provides a significant improvement of symptoms and function, although calf circumference and ankle plantarflexion strength do not recover fully. ? 2013 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546513479017,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1518,SC-901,Weimann et al. (2013),2013,Minimally invasive reconstruction of lateral tibial plateau fractures using the jail technique: A biomechanical study,"Background: This study described a novel, minimally invasive reconstruction technique of lateral tibial plateau fractures using a three-screw jail technique and compared it to a conventional two-screw osteosynthesis technique. The benefit of an additional screw implanted in the proximal tibia from the anterior at an angle of 90ø below the conventional two-screw reconstruction after lateral tibial plateau fracture was evaluated. This new method was called the jail technique. Methods. The two reconstruction techniques were tested using a porcine model (n = 40). Fracture was simulated using a defined osteotomy of the lateral tibial plateau. Load-to-failure and multiple cyclic loading tests were conducted using a material testing machine. Twenty tibias were used for each reconstruction technique, ten of which were loaded in a load-to-failure protocol and ten cyclically loaded (5000 times) between 200 and 1000 N using a ramp protocol. Displacement, stiffness and yield load were determined from the resulting load displacement curve. Failure was macroscopically documented. Results: In the load-to-failure testing, the jail technique showed a significantly higher mean maximum load (2275.9 N) in comparison to the conventional reconstruction (1796.5 N, p < 0.001). The trend for better outcomes for the novel technique in terms of stiffness and yield load did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). In cyclic testing, the jail technique also showed better trends in displacement that were not statistically significant. Failure modes showed a tendency of screws cutting through the bone (cut-out) in the conventional reconstruction. No cut-out but a bending of the lag screws at the site of the additional third screw was observed in the jail technique. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the jail and the conventional technique have seemingly similar biomechanical properties. This suggests that the jail technique may be a feasible alternative to conventional screw osteosynthesis in the minimally invasive reconstruction of lateral tibial plateau fractures. A potential advantage of the jail technique is the prevention of screw cut-outs through the cancellous bone. ? 2013 Weimann et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Scopus,10.1186/1471-2474-14-120,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders

(2013),2013,Less-invasive semitendinosus tendon graft augmentation for the reconstruction of chronic tears of the Achilles tendon,"Background: Less-extensive and gentler exposure and dissection of deep soft tissues could reduce the times of recovery and rehabilitation after Achilles tendon reconstruction. Hypothesis: A minimally invasive semitendinosus autologous graft reconstruction of the Achilles tendon preserves skin integrity and reduces wound breakdown. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 26 patients underwent minimally invasive semitendinosus autologous graft reconstruction for chronic ruptures to the Achilles tendon. Patients underwent a comparison of preoperative versus postoperative maximum calf circumference and isometric plantarflexion strength and evaluation of postoperative complications. The Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) was administered at the final follow-up appointment. Results: All patients were reviewed at an average of 8.2 years (range, 7-10 years) from surgery. No patient was lost to follow-up. At final follow-up, the maximum calf circumference was significantly higher than preoperatively but significantly lower than the contralateral side. The isometric plantarflexion strength in the operated leg was lower than in the uninjured one. The mean ATRS was 88. Two patients developed a superficial wound infection, both healing within 2 months from the index surgery after systemic antibiotics and local dressings. One patient developed scar adhesion to the distal wound. All patients returned to their preinjury working occupation; 22 patients returned to their preinjury level of activity at a mean of 6.7 months after surgery. Conclusion: This technique is minimally invasive, is safe, and allows most of the patients to return to preinjury daily and sport activities within 9 months from surgery. ? 2013 The Author(s).",Scopus,10.1177/0363546512473819,American Journal of Sports Medicine
1520,SC-903,Burnouf et al. (2013),2013,Blood-derived biomaterials and platelet growth factors in regenerative medicine,"Several biomaterials can be obtained from human blood. Some are used for clinical indications requiring a high content in fibrinogen, while others are used because they contain multiple platelet growth factors. Mimicking thrombin-induced physiological events of coagulation leading to fibrino-formation and platelet activation, blood biomaterials have critical advantages of being devoid of tissue necrotic effects and of being biodegradable by body enzymes. Fibrin-based biomaterials, known as fibrin glues or fibrin sealants, have been used for more than 30. years as surgical hemostatic and sealing agents, demonstrating benefits in essentially all surgical fields, including reconstructive plastic surgery and wound treatment. Clinical interest in platelet growth factor-rich biomaterials (often known as platelet gels or platelet-rich-plasma) has emerged more recently. Platelet gels are used in clinical situations to achieve wound healing and repair soft and hard tissues. Applications include the healing of recalcitrant ulcers and burns, and stimulation of osseous tissue regeneration in dentistry, implantology, and maxillofacial and plastic surgery. They were evaluated recently in knee osteoarthritis and for the repair of musculoskeletal tissue lesions in sports medicine. Platelet lysates are now used as a substitute for fetal bovine serum and for ex vivo clinical-scale expansion of stem cells, opening new perspectives in regenerative medicine. We present the scientific rationale that prevailed in the development of blood biomaterials, describe their modes of production and biochemical and functional characteristics, and present clinical applications in regenerative medicine. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.blre.2013.02.001,Blood Reviews
1521,SC-904,Lacourpaille et al. (2013),2013,Influence of stimulus intensity on electromechanical delay and its mechanisms,"Electromechanical delay (EMD) is the time lag between muscle activation and force development. Using very high frame rate ultrasound, both electrochemical and mechanical processes involved in EMD can be assessed. Percutaneous electrical stimulations at submaximal intensity are often used to stimulate a specific target muscle. The aim of this study was to determine whether stimulus intensity alters the delay between stimulation and the onset of muscle fascicules motion (Dm), the onset of myotendinous junction motion (Dt), and force production (EMD). Ten participants underwent two electrically evoked contractions, with the probe maintained either the biceps brachii muscle belly or the distal myotendinous junction of the biceps brachii, for six stimulus intensities (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 110% and 130% of the lowest intensity inducing the maximal involuntary force production, Imax). In addition, inter-day reliability was tested in nine participants at both 70% and 90% of Imax. Dm, Dt and EMD were significantly longer (p<. 0.001) at very low (30% and 50% of Imax) compared to higher intensities (70%, 90%, 110% and 130% of Imax). Inter-day reliability of EMD, Dm, and Dt was good (coefficient of variation ranged from 6.8% to 12.5%, i.e. SEM lower than 0.79. ms). These results indicate that the stimulus intensity needs to be standardized to perform longitudinal evaluation and/or to make between-subject comparisons. ? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2012.06.010,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology
1522,SC-905,Gehring et al. (2013),2013,How to sprain your ankle - a biomechanical case report of an inversion trauma,"In order to develop preventive measures against lateral ankle sprains, it is essential to have a detailed understanding of the injury mechanism. Under laboratory experimental conditions the examination of the joint load has to be restricted with clear margins of safety. However, in the present case one athlete sprained his ankle while performing a run-and-cut movement during a biomechanical research experiment. 3D kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity of the lower limb were recorded and compared to 16 previously performed trials. Motion patterns of global pelvis orientation, hip flexion, and knee flexion in the sprain trail deviated from the reference trials already early in the preparatory phase before ground contact. During ground contact, the ankle was rapidly plantar flexed (up to 1240ø/s), inverted (up to 1290ø/s) and internally rotated (up to 580ø/s) reaching its maximum displacement within the first 150. ms after heel strike. Rapid neuromuscular activation bursts of the m. tibialis anterior and the m. peroneus longus started 40-45. ms after ground contact and overshot the activation profile of the reference trials with peak activation at 62. ms and 74. ms respectively. Therefore, it may be suggested that neuromuscular reflexes played an important role in joint control during the critical phase of excessive ankle displacement. The results of this case report clearly indicate that (a) upper leg mechanics, (b) pre-landing adjustments, and (c) neuromuscular contribution have to be considered in the mechanism of lateral ankle sprains. ? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.09.016,Journal of Biomechanics

(2013),2013,Tendons and Ligament Tissue Engineering,"This chapter describes and discusses the various types of strategies that have been proposed to promote healing or completely replace injured tendons and ligaments, using the tissue-engineering approach. Several research groups have developed connective tissue models, tendons and ligaments substitutes and cell-based healing strategies to provide new clinical options to be applied in reconstructive orthopedic surgery. Animal models are also described, being essential to the functional assessment of new biomedical alternatives. The scope of tendons and ligaments that are under study reflects the need to provide solutions to the loss of function that occurs too frequently during sport and repetitive activities. Tendons of the rotator cuff of the shoulder, the Achilles' tendon of the ankle, as well as the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint are too frequently the target of injuries during sport practice and repetitive movements. These structures often present long-term functional problems after conventional reconstructive surgery. The tissue-engineering approach contributes to overcome these issues, through better understanding of the role of cells and biomaterials to promote connective tissue repair. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

(2013),2013,Isokinetic testing of evertor and invertor muscles in patients with chronic ankle instability,"Ankle sprains are among the most common sport-related injuries and can lead to chronic ankle instability. Impaired sensorimotor function of the ankle musculature is often suggested as a cause. The current study sought to assess and compare the isokinetic performance and electromyographic patterns of evertor and invertor muscles in patients with chronic ankle instability and in a control group. Twelve patients with chronic ankle instability and twelve healthy subjects were included. Isokinetic eccentric and concentric testing at various angular velocities was performed for eversion and inversion movements. The corresponding myoelectric activities of the fibularis longus and tibialis anterior muscles were quantified from surface electromyographic recordings by computing average root mean square values. Patients had lower myoelectric activity of the evertor and invertor muscles than controls did; this difference could account for the eccentric weakness associated with ankle instability. Functional strength ratios revealed a dynamic strength imbalance in unstable ankle patients and that may contribute to recurrent injury. Our findings suggest that rehabilitation programs for unstable ankle patients must be focused on the motor control of eccentric contractions of the ankle evertors and invertors, to boost these muscles' contribution to ankle stabilization. ? 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jab.29.6.696,Journal of Applied Biomechanics

Both P-PRP were obtained by drawing blood from the jugular vein into tubes containing sodium citrate as anticoagulant and, centrifuged at 259 g for 6 minutes. The number of concentrated platelets in the P-PRP-A was 716.14 X 103/?L and 630 X 103/?L for P-PRP-B. Cell counts were significantly different (P > 0.05) between whole blood and PRP fractions A and B, for RBC counts (10 6/?L), WBC (103/?L), PLT (103/?L) and PDW (%) but not for MPV (fL). Gender differences were found in P-PRP-A for RBC (106/?L), which was higher in males, and the MPV (fL), which was higher in females. In fraction P-PRP-B a difference was found for MPV (fL), which was higher in females. The PDW (%) was higher in males compared with females. The platelet collection efficiency was 20.76% for P-PRP-A and 18.27% for P-PRP-B. The platelet concentration considering whole blood was 186.92% for P-PRP-A and 164.44% for P-PRP-B. The protocol described in this study represents a simple method to obtain P-PRP in rabbits for experimental purposes and even for therapeutic use.",Scopus,10.4067/S0301-732X2013000300006,Archivos de Medicina Veterinaria
1528,SC-911,Needle et al. (2013),2013,Brain regulation of muscle tone in healthy and functionally unstable ankles,"Current research into the etiology of joint instability has yielded inconsistent results, limiting our understanding of how to prevent and treat ligamentous injury effectively. Recently, cortical reorganization was demonstrated in patients with ligamentous injury; however, these neural changes have not been assessed relative to joint laxity. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to determine if changes in cortical excitability and inhibition occur in subjects with functional ankle instability, as well as to investigate the relationship between these measures and joint laxity. Design: Posttest only with control group. Setting: University laboratory. Subjects: 12 subjects with no history of ankle sprain (CON) and 12 subjects with a history of unilateral functional ankle instability (UNS). Interventions: Subjects were tested for joint laxity using an instrumented ankle arthrometer. Cortical excitability and inhibition were assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to obtain motor-evoked potentials and the cortical silent period from the lower leg muscles. Main Outcome Measures: Joint laxity was quantified as peak anterior displacement and inversion rotation. Active motor threshold, slope, and intensity at 50% of peak slope of TMS-derived recruitment curves were used to quantify cortical excitability from lower leg muscles, while the cortical silent period from the peroneus longus was used to represent intracortical inhibition. Results: No significant differences were observed between groups for laxity or cortical measures. CON demonstrated a significant relationship between laxity and tibialis anterior excitability, as well as laxity and silent period, while UNS ankles demonstrated significant relationships between peroneal and soleus excitability and laxity measures. Conclusion: Our results support relationships between laxity and measures of excitability and inhibition that differ between healthy and unstable subjects. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms behind these findings and consider cortical influences when investigating altered joint laxity. ? 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.22.3.202,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

1530,SC-913,Minshull et al. (2013),2013,The effects of hypohydration and fatigue on neuromuscular activation performance,"This study investigated the effects of hypohydration by fluid restriction on voluntary and evoked indices of neuromuscular performance at a functional joint angle. Measures of static volitional peak force (2-3-s maximal muscle actions) and evoked peak twitch force, electromechanical delay, and rate of force development were obtained from the knee extensors (30ø knee flexion) of 10 males (age, 24 (4) years; height, 1.76 (0.10) m; body mass, 78.7 (9.13) kg (mean (SD))) prior to and immediately following 24 h of (i) euhydration (EU) and (ii) hypohydration (HYP). Neuromuscular performance was also assessed in response to a fatiguing task (3 ? 30-s maximal static knee extensions) following each condition. Repeated-measures ANOVAs showed that HYP was associated with a significant 2.1% loss in body mass (p < 0.001) and a 7.8% reduction in volitional peak force (p < 0.05). Following fatigue, data indicated statistically similar levels of impairment to volitional peak force (11.6%, p < 0.01) and rate of force development (21.0%, p < 0.01) between conditions (EU; HYP). No changes to any other indices of performance were observed. The substantive hypohydration-induced deficits to muscle strength at this functional joint angle might convey a decreased performance capability and should be considered by the hypohydrated athlete. Whilst hypohydration did not affect fatiguerelated performance of the knee extensors, the additive changes associated with lower baseline levels of strength performance (7.8%) and fatigue (11.6%) coupled with slower rate of muscle force production (from 0-100 ms) following fatigue may present significant challenges to the maintenance of dynamic knee joint stability, particularly at this vulnerable joint position.",Scopus,10.1139/apnm-2012-0189,"Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism"
1531,SC-914,Pietrosimone et al. (2012),2012,Chronic ankle instability and corticomotor excitability of the fibularis longus muscle,"Context: Neuromuscular deficits are common in people with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Corticomotor pathways are very influential in the production of voluntary muscle function, yet these pathways have not been evaluated in people with CAI. Objective: To determine if corticomotor excitability of the fibularis longus (FL) differs between individuals with unilateral CAI and matched control participants without CAI. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Ten people with CAI (4 men, ñ women; age = 21.2 ñ 1.23 years, height = 175.13 ñ 9.7 cm, mass = 77.1 ñ 13.58 kg) and 10 people without CAI (4 men, ñ women; age = 21.2 ñ 2.3 years; height = 172.34 ñ 8.86 cm, mass = 73.4 ñ 7.15 kg) volunteered for this study. Main Outcome Measure(s): Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed over the motor cortex on neurons corresponding with the FL. All testing was performed with the participant in a seated position with a slightly flexed knee joint and the ankle secured in 10ø of plantar flexion. The resting motor threshold (RMT), which was expressed as a percentage of 2 T, was considered the lowest amount of magnetic energy that would induce an FL motor evoked potential equal to or greater than 20 ?V, as measured with surface electromyography, on 7 consecutive stimuli. In addition, the Functional Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and FADI Sport were used to assess self-reported function. Results: Higher RMTs were found in the injured and uninjured FL of the CAI group (60.8% ñ 8.4% and 59.1% ñ 8.99%, respectively) than the healthy group (52.8% ñ 8.56% and 52% ñ 7.0%, respectively; F<inf>1,18</inf> = 4.92, P = .04). No leg 3 group interactions (F<inf>1,18</inf> = 0.1, P = .76) or between-legs differences (F<inf>1,18</inf> = 0.74, P = .40) were found. A moderate negative correlation was found between RMT and FADI (r = -0.4, P = .04) and FADI Sport (r =-0.44, P = .03), suggesting that higher RMT is related to lower self-reported function. Conclusions: Higher bilateral RMTs may indicate deficits in FL corticomotor excitability in people with CAI. In addition, a moderate correlation between RMT and FADI suggests that cortical excitability deficits may be influential in altering function. ? by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc. 2012.",Scopus,10.4085/1062-6050-47.6.11,Journal of Athletic Training
1532,SC-915,Kurz et al. (2012),2012,Ankle muscle activation in people with haemophilia,"Since normative surface EMG (SEMG) values for muscles acting at the knee joint are available for people with haemophilia, increasing interest is noticeable for other joints affected by haemophilic arthropathy. Adequate activity of shank muscles is an important key for appropriate postural control. The aim of this study was to determine differences in muscle activation patterns of lower leg muscles between people with and without haemophilia during upright standing. SEMG of tibialis anterior (TA), fibularis longus (FL), lateral (LG) and medial (MG) heads of gastrocnemius, and soleus (SO) muscles of both sides were recorded in 25 haemophilic patients (H) and 25 non-haemophilic control subjects (C) while standing on even ground. The Gilbert-Score was used to assign sides to major (H-MA) and minor (H-MI) affected ankle joints in H. To normalize the SEMG amplitudes, amplitude ratios (percentage of cumulated activity) were calculated. Compared to controls, TA ratios showed higher and MG reduced levels in both H groups (P < 0.01). In the H-MA subgroup of H, FL also joined the TA behaviour whereas SO had similar activation direction as MG. Although possible descending influences from the knee joints cannot be excluded, this can be interpreted as a compensational mechanism due to the severity of the orthopaedic status of the ankle, which with increasing heaviness is accompanied by reduced plantar flexion capability. However, ankle joint integrity appears to be reduced in H, with TA and MG seeming to play key roles for neuromuscular control of upright posture. ? 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Scopus,10.1111/j.1365-2516.2012.02852.x,Haemophilia

Flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and peroneus longus (PL) canine tendons were harvested and divided into four groups. The repair technique we compared was a step-cut (SC) suture and a Pulvertaft weave (PW). FDP tendons were significantly larger in diameter than PL tendons (p < 0.05). The volume of the SC repairs using either FDP or PL tendon as a graft was significantly smaller than PW repairs (p < 0.05). The ultimate load to failure and repair stiffness in FDP graft tendons significantly increased compared with the PL graft tendons (p < 0.05). The SC suture can be used as an alternative to the PW, with similar strength and less bulk for repairs using graft tendons of similar diameter. Surgeons should be aware of the effect of graft tendon size and repair method on strength and bulk when performing flexor tendon grafts. ?

Our aim was to describe atypical and rare clinical presentations of gouty tophi to help increase physician awareness and aid in patient care. Methods: The relevant English literature of unusual gout manifestations was searched using the keywords gout, toph*, monosodium urate, uric acid, unusual, and rare. Well-described case reports, case series, and review articles were evaluated and included, if relevant, in the literature review. Results: Review of the literature revealed many unusual manifestations of gouty tophi involving the head and neck, skin, viscera, bones, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and axial skeleton. Transplant recipients, women, and elderly people are particularly susceptible to developing tophi. Furthermore, gout can cause diagnostic dilemmas, as it can be a great mimicker of and can coexist with infection, malignancy, and other connective tissue diseases. Imaging modalities can help detect tophi in atypical locations. Conclusions: Tophi can present in unexpected locations, even as the first sign of gout, and vigilance is required when unusual symptoms or signs occur in a patient with gout. ? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Scopus,10.1016/j.semarthrit.2012.03.007,Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism

Methods: From January 2006 to December 2009, 35 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries were recruited to undergo surgical procedures. There were 30 males and 5 females with an average age of 31.8 years (range: 21 - 56). All anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions underwent arthrosocopy. All ligaments were reconstructed with peroneus longus tendon and fixed with absorb screw. The post-operative assessments included the followings; clinical evaluations, Lysholm knee score, KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale (AOFAS). Results: All cases were followed up for an average follow-up period of 15 months (range: 12 -24). The healing time was 6-15 weeks, according to the Lysholm knee score, their outcomes were excellent (n =25), good (n =6), fair (n = 3) and poor (n = 1). The average score was 97.2 (range: 60 - 100). The rate of excellent and good was 88.6%; according to the KT-3000 arthrometer evaluations, the outcomes were normal (n =28), nearly normal (n = 4), abnormal (n = 2) and poor (n = 1). Preoperatively, the average anterior displacement was 11.59 ñ 1.25 mm and the average anterior displacement at final follow-up 1.76 ñ 1.83 mm. The average AOFAS score was 96.3 (range: 84 - 100). Lysholm knee score and KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation had statistical differences (P < 0.05) while AOFAS score showed no difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon can be a good substitute of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. And its resection has no major influence for ankle joint.

1536,SC-919,Shadgan et al. (2012),2012,Hemodynamic and oxidative mechanisms of tourniquet-induced muscle injury: Near-infrared spectroscopy for the orthopedics setting,"During orthopedic procedures, the tourniquets used to maintain bloodless surgical fields cause ischemia and then reperfusion (I/R), leading to oxidative muscle injury. Established methods exist neither for monitoring orthopedic I/R nor for predicting the extent of tourniquet-associated oxidative injury. To develop a predictive model for tourniquet-associated oxidative muscle injury, this study combined real-time near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring of I/R with Western blotting (WB) for oxidized proteins. We hypothesized strong correlations between NIRS-derived I/R indices and muscle protein oxidation. In 17 patients undergoing ankle fracture repair, a thigh tourniquet was inflated on the injured limb (300 mmHg). Using a continuous-wave (CW) NIRS setup, oxygenated (O<inf>2</inf>Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), and total (tHb) hemoglobin were monitored bilaterally (tourniquet versus control) in leg muscles. Leg muscle biopsies were collected unilaterally (tourniquet side) immediately after tourniquet inflation (pre) and before deflation (post). Average ischemia duration was 43.2 ñ 14.6 min. In post-compared to prebiopsies, muscle protein oxidation (quantified using WB) increased 172.3% ñ 145.7% (P < 0.0005). Changes in O<inf>2</inf>Hb and tHb were negatively correlated with protein oxidation (respectively: P = 0.040, R2 = 0.25 and P = 0.003, R2 = 0.58). Reoxygenation rate was positively correlated with protein oxidation (P = 0.041, R2 = 0.25). These data indicate that using CW NIRS, it is possible to predict orthopedic tourniquet-associated muscle oxidative injury noninvasively. ? 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",Scopus,10.1117/1.JBO.17.8.081408,Journal of Biomedical Optics

The objectives of this study were to improve anatomical knowledge of the synovial cavities of the ovine knee and to compare intra-articular injection techniques. Synovial cavities of 24 cadaver hind limbs from 12 adult sheep were investigated by intra-articular resin, positive-contrast arthrography, computed tomography (CT) arthrography and gross anatomical dissection. Communication between femoro-patellar, medial femoro-tibial and lateral femoro-tibial compartments occurred in all cases. The knee joint should be considered as one synovial structure with three communicating compartments. Several unreported features were observed, including a communication between the medial femoro-tibial and lateral femoro-tibial compartments and a latero-caudal recess of the lateral femoro-tibial compartment. No intermeniscal ligament was identified. CT was able to define many anatomical features of the stifle, including the anatomy of the tendinous synovial recess on the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia under the combined tendon of the peroneus tertius, extensor longus digitorum and extensor digiti III proprius. An approach for intra-articular injection into this recess (the subtendinous technique) was assessed and compared with the retropatellar and paraligamentous techniques. All three injection procedures were equally successful, but the subtendinous technique appeared to be most appropriate for synoviocentesis and for injections in therapeutic research protocols with less risk of damaging the articular cartilage. ? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.tvjl.2011.12.011,Veterinary Journal
1538,SC-921,Xu et al. (2012),2012,Biomechanical evaluation of tenodesis reconstruction in ankle with deltoid ligament deficiency: A finite element analysis,"Purpose: Isolated deltoid ligament injuries are relatively uncommon but can be a significant source of pain and disability. Several approaches to deltoid reconstruction have been reported. However, there is no previous comparative study of Wiltberger, Deland, Kitaoka and Hintermann procedures with respect to biomechanical characteristics such as kinematics, ligaments and grafts stresses using finite element analysis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical results of those deltoid ligament reconstructions using finite element analysis. Methods: A three-dimensional finite element model of the ankle including six bony structures, cartilage and nine principal ligaments surrounding the ankle joint complex was developed and validated. In addition to the intact model, superficial deltoid-deficient, deltoid-deficient, Wiltberger reconstruction, Deland reconstruction, Kitaoka reconstruction and Hintermann reconstruction models were simulated. Then, the forces in the ligaments and grafts and the kinematics of talus and calcaneus were predicted for an eversional or external torque through the range of ankle flexion. Results: No reconstructions could completely restore the values for ankle flexibility and the stresses of the lateral ligaments to normality. The Kitaoka procedure was the most effective technique in eliminating external rotation displacement. The Deland procedure restored better the talar tilt than the other three reconstructions. Conclusion: This study showed that Kitaoka and Deland procedures have advantages with regard to rotational stabilities as well as ligaments stress in comparison with other methods. ? 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-011-1762-z,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"
1539,SC-922,Park et al. (2012),2012,Facilitative moderation for online participation in eRulemaking,"This paper describes the use of facilitative moderation strategies in an online rulemaking public participation system. Rulemaking is one of the U.S. government's most important policymaking methods. Although broad transparency and participation rights are part of its legal structure, significant barriers prevent effective engagement by many groups of interested citizens. Regulation Room, an experimental open-government partnership between academic researchers and government agencies, is a socio-technical participation system that uses multiple methods to lower potential barriers to broader participation. To encourage effective individual comments and productive group discussion in Regulation Room, we adapt strategies for facilitative human moderation originating from social science research in deliberative democracy and alternative dispute resolution [24, 1, 18, 14] for use in the demanding online participation setting of eRulemaking. We develop a moderation protocol, deploy it in ""live"" Department of Transportation (DOT) rulemakings, and provide an initial analysis of its use through a manual coding of all moderator interventions with respect to the protocol. We then investigate the feasibility of automating the moderation protocol: we employ annotated data from the coding project to train machine learning-based classifiers to identify places in the online discussion where human moderator intervention is required. Though the trained classifiers only marginally outperform the baseline, the improvement is statistically significant in spite of limited data and a very basic feature set, which is a promising result. ? 2012 ACM.",Scopus,10.1145/2307729.2307757,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series
1540,SC-923,Levin et al. (2012),2012,Sway activity and muscle recruitment order during transition from double to single-leg stance in subjects with chronic ankle instability,"Subjects with CAI (chronic ankle instability) are slower in activating their leg muscles when shifting weight (from double to single leg stance; DLS and SLS). We examined if these delays are associated with longer transition/stabilization times. This was tested by analyzing the center of pressure (COP) trajectory data (1) in the DLS phase before onset of transition, (2) in the quasi-stable phase of the SLS, immediately after the transition phase but before time to stabilization (TTS) and (3) in the SLS phase after TTS. Data were recorded from 20 subjects with CAI and 20 controls. The TTS was longer for the CAIs than for controls (3.25 vs. 2.28. s in EO and 3.41 vs. 2.51. s in EC; . p<. 0.001). Similarly, the time of transition (TTR) was prolonged in CAIs (1.48 vs. 1.14. s in EO and 1.53 vs. 1.20. s in EC; . p<. 0.05). These prolonged periods came in parallel with an increase in the ML sway in the quasi-stable phase (mean displacement 2.20 vs. 1.75. cm in EO; 3.37 vs. 2.62. cm in EC; significant for EC . p<. 0.05). The TTR in CAIs was positively correlated with time onsets of the adductor longus muscle during transitions with EC (R=. 0.51, . p=. 0.03). The findings support the use of a weight-shifting paradigm for the evaluation of balance control in CAI. Specifically, we underscore the transition phase and quasi-stable phase of the SLS as promising time windows for documenting balance control deficits in CAI. ? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2012.05.009,Gait and Posture
1541,SC-924,Tohno et al. (2012),2012,Characteristics of the three ligaments of human spring ligament complex from a viewpoint of elements,"To elucidate characteristics of the three ligaments constituting the spring ligament complex from a viewpoint of elements, the authors investigated age-related changes of elements, relationships among their elements, relationships among ligaments in the elements, and gender differences in the three ligaments of the spring ligament complex, the superomedial calcaneonavicular (SMCN), inferoplantar longitudinal calcaneonavicular (ICN), and third or medioplantar oblique calcaneonavicular (TCN) ligaments. After ordinary dissection at Nara Medical University was finished, the SMCN, ICN, and TCN ligaments of the spring ligament complex were removed from the subjects. The subjects consisted of 10 men and 12 women, ranging in age from 62 to 99 years (average age=80.5ñ9.7 years). After incineration with nitric acid and perchloric acid, the element contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. It was found that although the Ca and P content hardly changed in the SMCN ligament with aging, the Ca and P content in the ICN ligament increased to about three and five times higher in the 80s in comparison with the 60s, respectively, whereas in the TCN ligament, it increased about 40% and 90% higher in the 80s compared with the 60s, respectively. Regarding the relationships among elements, significant direct correlations were found among the contents of Ca, P, and Mg in all the three ligaments of the spring ligament complex. This finding was in agreement with the previous finding obtained with the three ligaments of the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, and ligamentum capitis femoris. Whether there were significant correlations among the three ligaments of the spring ligament complex with regard to the Ca, P, S, Mg, Zn, and Fe contents was examined using Pearson's correlation. It was found that there were significant direct correlations between the SMCN and TCN ligaments in all the Ca, P, Mg, and Zn contents and also between the SMCN and ICN ligaments in both the Mg and Fe contents but not between the TCN and ICN ligaments in the six element contents. Regarding the gender difference in elements, a significant gender difference was found only in the Mg content of the SMCN ligament, being significantly higher in men than in women. ?

Measures were obtained during three experimental conditions: (i) 'fatigue-muscle damage', involving acute fatiguing exercise performed on each assessment occasion plus a single episode of eccentric exercise performed on the first occasion and after the fatigue trial; (ii) 'fatigue', involving the fatiguing exercise only; and (iii) 'control' consisting of no exercise. Assessments were performed prior to (pre) and at 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 168 h relative to the muscle damaging eccentric exercise. Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) showed that muscle damage elicited reductions of up to 38%, 24% and 65% in volitional peak force, electromechanical delay and rate of force development compared to baseline and controls, respectively (F <inf>[10, 80]</inf> = 2.3 to 4.6; P < 0.05) with further impairments (6.2% to 30.7%) following acute fatigue (F <inf>[2, 16]</inf> = 4.3 to 9.1; P < 0.05). By contrast, magnetically-evoked electromechanical delay was not influenced by muscle damage and was improved during the superimposed acute fatigue (~14%; F <inf>[2, 16]</inf> = 3.9; P < 0.05). The safeguarding of evoked muscle activation capability despite compromised volitional performance might reveal aspects of capabilities for emergency and protective responses during episodes of fatigue and antecedent muscle damaging exercise. ? 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Scopus,10.1080/02640414.2012.682084,Journal of Sports Sciences

At an average of 10.9 years of follow-up, the maximum calf circumference of the operatively treated leg remained substantially decreased and the operatively treated limb was significantly weaker than the contralateral, normal limb. Two patients had developed tendinopathy of the contralateral Achilles tendon, one had developed tendinopathy of the reconstructed tendon, and one had ruptured the contralateral Achilles tendon eight years after the index tear. Conclusions: The long-term results of treatment of chronic tears of the Achilles tendon with free gracilis tendon grafting showed that patients retained good functional results despite permanently impaired ankle plantar flexion strength and decreased calf circumference.

(2012),2012,Unilateral eccentric exercise of the knee flexors affects muscle activation during gait,"Uni-lateral muscle soreness is common yet the effects on gait or electromyographic (EMG) activity are unknown. The purpose of our study was to induce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) in the knee flexor group and measure the resultant change in EMG activity and knee motion during gait. Nine healthy subjects participated in the study. Measures of function, evoked tenderness of the biceps femoris, as well as knee angle, and EMG activity during gait were assessed prior and 48. h after an eccentric exercise protocol. DOMS was induced unilaterally in the knee flexors using an isokinetic dynamometer and subjects exercised until they could not generate 50% of their maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). There was a significant decrease in biceps femoris activity after DOMS during the last phase of gait. Moreover, there was a day ? phase interaction for gastrocnemius activity with the last two phases displaying an increase in activity. There was no significant change in knee angle during gait. The decrease in biceps femoris activity as well as the increase in gastrocnemius activity could be evidence of a protective mechanism designed to decrease activity of the sore muscle while increasing the activity of a synergistic muscle. ? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2012.01.009,Gait and Posture

(2012),2012,Changes in biomechanics and muscle activation in injured ballet dancers during a jump-land task with turnout (Sissonne Ferm‚e),"Large impact loading with abnormal muscle activity and motion patterns may contribute to lower extremity injuries in ballet dancers. Yet, few studies investigated the influence of injury on the ballet movement. The purpose of this study was to find the neuromuscular and biomechanical characteristics in dancers with and without ankle injury during a jump-landing Sissonne Ferm‚e task. Twenty-two ballet dancers were recruited and divided into the injured group (n = 11) and the uninjured group (n = 11). They performed a ballet movement called ""Sissonne Ferm‚e"" with reflective markers and electrodes attached to their lower extremities. Ground reaction force, joint kinematics, and muscle activity were measured. The injured dancers had greater peak ankle eversion but smaller hindfoot-to-tibial eversion angles. Also, the injured dancers had greater activity of the hamstring of the dominant leg and tibialis anterior of the non-dominant leg during the pre-landing phase. The injured dancers had greater tibialis anterior activity of the dominant leg but less muscle activity in the medial gastrocnemius of the non-dominant leg during the post-landing phase. The injured dancers had a greater co-contraction index in the non-dominant ankle and a lower loading rate. The higher co-contraction indices showed that the injured dancers required more muscle effort to control ankle stability. Furthermore, the injured dancers used a ""load avoidance strategy"" to protect themselves from re-injury. Neuromuscular control training of the ankle joint for ballet dancers to prevent injury is necessary. ? 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Scopus,10.1080/02640414.2012.663097,Journal of Sports Sciences

(2012),2012,The biomechanical and clinical application of using the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft source,"Background: The shortage of autogenous grafts has often times been a problem in knee ligament reconstruction. There are little data concerning the use of the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) as an autograft.Hypothesis: The AHPLT is a suitable graft with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study and case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: The safety and efficacy of using the AHPLT as an autograft source were evaluated. A cadaveric study was first done to reveal the anatomic profile of the AHPLT, to test its failure load, and to compare it with that of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. Then, a cadaveric harvest study was performed to show it was safe and reproducible. The space between the tendon stripper and the peroneal nerve during harvesting of the AHPLT was evaluated. Lastly, a clinical study was performed to evaluate donor site morbidity. The preoperative and postoperative foot and ankle functions of 92 patients who underwent a variety of knee ligament reconstructions with the AHPLT were followed for more than 2 years and were then evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) to determine the influence of tendon removal on ankle and foot function.Results: The average failure load of the AHPLT was 322.35 ñ 63.18 N, accounting for 97.69% ñ 19.48% and 147.94% ñ 41.30% of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, respectively. During tendon harvesting, the distance between the head of the tendon stripper and the branching point of the deep peroneus nerve was 4.6 to 10.4 cm. The clinical study showed that the preoperative and postoperative AOFAS scores were 97.4 ñ 2.0 and 97.2 ñ 1.6 (P =.85), respectively, while the FADI scores preoperatively and postoperatively were 96.8 ñ 2.2 and 96.9 ñ 2.5 (P =.91), respectively. No signs of peroneus nerve injury, peroneus longus tendon rupture, or tendinopathy were found. Conclusion: The AHPLT is acceptable for use as an autograft with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity. ? 2012 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1177/0363546511428782,American Journal of Sports Medicine

(2012),2012,Surgical reconstruction of chronic achilles tendon ruptures using various methods,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcomes of reconstruction of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures using various methods, including Achilles tendon allograft. Between October 2003 and March 2010, twelve patients with chronic Achilles tendon ruptures and a defect gap of >4 cm underwent surgical reconstruction with V-Y advancement, gastrocnemius fascial turn-down flap, flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer, or Achilles tendon allograft. The study group comprised 11 men and 1 woman. At last follow-up, all patients were assessed with regard to postoperative complications, self-reported level of satisfaction, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score, repetitive single-heel rises, single-leg hopping test, and ankle range of motion. The AOFAS scores increased from an average of 68.7 (range, 50-87) preoperatively to 98.0 (range, 88-100) postoperatively. All patients were able to perform 10 repetitive single-heel raises and single-leg hops at last follow-up. No patient experienced wound complications or deep infection. Seven patients were rated as excellent, 4 as good, and 1 as fair. Chronic Achilles tendon ruptures can be successfully treated by careful selection of the reconstruction method according to the le ngth of defect gap and state of the remaining tissue. With an extensive defect, use of an Achilles tendon allograft can be a good option.",Scopus,10.3928/01477447-20120123-13,Orthopedics
1551,SC-934,Kornegay et al. (2012),2012,Canine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and their use in therapeutic strategies,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder in which the loss of dystrophin causes progressive degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Potential therapies that carry substantial risk, such as gene- and cell-based approaches, must first be tested in animal models, notably the mdx mouse and several dystrophin-deficient breeds of dogs, including golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD). Affected dogs have a more severe phenotype, in keeping with that of DMD, so may better predict disease pathogenesis and treatment efficacy. Various phenotypic tests have been developed to characterize disease progression in the GRMD model. These biomarkers range from measures of strength and joint contractures to magnetic resonance imaging. Some of these tests are routinely used in clinical veterinary practice, while others require specialized equipment and expertise. By comparing serial measurements from treated and untreated groups, one can document improvement or delayed progression of disease. Potential treatments for DMD may be broadly categorized as molecular, cellular, or pharmacologic. The GRMD model has increasingly been used to assess efficacy of a range of these therapies. A number of these studies have provided largely general proof-of-concept for the treatment under study. Others have demonstrated efficacy using the biomarkers discussed. Importantly, just as symptoms in DMD vary among patients, GRMD dogs display remarkable phenotypic variation. Though confounding statistical analysis in preclinical trials, this variation offers insight regarding the role that modifier genes play in disease pathogenesis. By correlating functional and mRNA profiling results, gene targets for therapy development can be identified. ? 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Scopus,10.1007/s00335-011-9382-y,Mammalian Genome

1553,SC-936,Ergen et al. (2012),2012,Prevention of ligament injuries,"Ligaments are specialized bands of connective tissues having distinct biomechanical properties. Their ability to adapt to the complex functions enables them to perform different tasks. Ligaments are not inert and they respond to many local and systemic factors that influence their function. Ligament that is subjected to an injury shows drastic changes in its structure and physiology. After an injury, ligament function is restored by the formation of scar tissue. However, this newly formed structure is biologically and biomechanically inferior to the tissue it replaces. Therefore, prevention always plays a primary role in preserving the original characteristics of ligamentous structures. This article will briefly review possible preventive intervention strategies for ligaments, referring specifically to what is known about two of the most extensively studied and clinically relevant knee (the anterior cruciate (ACL) and medial collateral (MCL) ligaments) and ankle ligaments. ?

1555,SC-938,Lynn et al. (2012),2012,Differences in static- and dynamic-balance task performance after 4 weeks of intrinsic-foot-muscle training: The short-foot exercise versus the towel-curl exercise,"Context: Proper functioning of the intrinsic foot musculature (IFM) is essential in maintaining the integrity of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA). Improper functioning of the IFM leads to excessive pronation of the foot, which has been linked to various pathologies. Therefore, training the IFM to avoid excessive pronation may help prevent some of these pathologies; however, it is not clear how to train these muscles optimally. Objective: To investigate the effects of 2 different types of IFM training on the height of the MLA and static- and dynamic-balance task performance. Design: Randomized controlled trial, repeated-measures mixed-model design. Setting: University biomechanics laboratory for testing and a home-based training program. Participants: 24 healthy, university-age volunteers (3 groups of 8) with no history of major lower limb pathology or balance impairment. Interventions: One experimental group performed 4 wk of the short-foot exercise (SFE) and the other performed 4 wk of the towel-curl exercise (TCE). Participants were asked to perform 100 repetitions of their exercise per day. Main Outcome Measures: Navicular height during weight bearing, the total range of movement of the center of pressure (COP) in the mediolateral (ML) direction for a static-balance test and a dynamic-balance test. Results: There were no differences in the navicular height or static-balance tests. For the dynamic-balance test, all groups decreased the ML COP movement on the dominant limb by a small amount (~5 mm); however, the SFE group was able to decrease COP movement much more than the TCE group in the nondominant limb. Conclusions: The SFE appeared to train the IFM more effectively than the TCE; however, there were differing results between the dominant and nondominant legs. These imbalances need to be taken into consideration by clinicians. ? 2012 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.21.4.327,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation
1556,SC-939,Chen et al. (2012),2012,Electromechanical delay of the vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis in individuals with patellofemoral pain syndrome,"Study Design: Case-control study. Objective: To examine electromechanical delay (EMD) of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) and the vastus lateralis (VL) in individuals with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Background: EMD is a mechanical property of muscles related to protective reflex and sports performance. The time duration of the EMD can be shortened with strength training and, conversely, can be lengthened secondary to immobilization. However, it is unclear if EMD between various components of the quadriceps is affected in individuals with PFPS. Methods: Twenty-six individuals with PFPS and 26 healthy volunteers were studied. The VMO and VL were electrically stimulated to evoke muscle twitches. Ultrasound was used to assess patellar movement elicited by the muscle twitch. The time from the onset of electrical stimulation to the onset of patellar movement was measured as the EMD. The EMDs of the VMO and VL were compared between groups using a mixed-model analysis of variance. Results: Subsequent to a significant interaction (P<.001), post hoc analysis indicated that the EMD of the VMO was longer (PFPS, 37.3 ñ 0.7 milliseconds; control, 25.9 ñ 0.7 milliseconds; P<.001) and the EMD of the VL was shorter (PFPS, 18.4 ñ 0.5 milliseconds; control, 25.1 ñ 0.5 milliseconds; P<.001) in the PFPS group. Therefore, in the individuals with PFPS, the EMD of the VMO was significantly longer than that of the VL (P<.001), which was not the case for those in the control group (P = .20). Conclusion: The mechanical properties of the VMO and VL may be altered in patients with PFPS.

Twenty-three participants performed randomized single-leg vertical drop landings from 20 cm. Subjects were blinded to the landing surface (a flat force plate or 30ø inversion wedge on the force plate). After each trial, participants reported whether they anticipated the landing surface. Participant responses were validated with EMG data. The protocol was repeated until four anticipated and four unanticipated landings onto the inversion wedge were recorded. Results revealed a significant main effect for landing condition. Normalized vertical ground reaction force (% body weights), maximum ankle inversion (degrees), inversion velocity (degrees/second), and time from contact to peak muscle activation (seconds) were significantly greater in unanticipated landings, and the time from peak muscle activation to maximum VGRF (second) was shorter. Unanticipated landings presented different muscle activation patterns than landings onto anticipated surfaces, which calls into question the usefulness of clinical studies that have not controlled for anticipation bias. ? 2012 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jab.28.2.148,Journal of Applied Biomechanics

Volitional peak force was impaired progressively (?16% vs. baseline: 235.3 ñ 54.7 to 198.1 ñ 38.5 N) by the fatiguing exercise and recovered to within ?97 % of baseline values following 6 min of rest. Evoked peak twitch force was diminished subsequent to the fourth episode of exercise (23.3%: 21.4 ñ 13.8 vs. 16.4 ñ 14.6 N) and remained impaired at this level throughout the recovery. Impairment of volitional electromechanical delay performance following the first episode of exercise (25.5%: 55.3 ñ 11.9 vs. 69.5 ñ 24.5 ms) contrasted with concurrent improvement (10.0%: 24.5 ñ 4.7 vs. 22.1 ñ 5.0 ms) in evoked electromechanical delay (P < 0.05), and this increased disparity between evoked and volitional electromechanical delay remained during subsequent periods of intervention and recovery. The fatiguing exercise provoked substantial impairments to volitional strength and volitional electromechanical delay that showed differential patterns of recovery. However, improved evoked electromechanical delay performance might identify a dormant capability for optimal muscle responses during acute stressful exercise and an improved capacity to maintain dynamic joint stabilty during critical episodes of loading. ? 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Scopus,10.1080/02640414.2011.627370,Journal of Sports Sciences

Hence, can be necessary a tendon graft because may be not possible to directly reattach the Achilles tendon. The free hamstrings tendon transfer and interference screw fixation for less invasive reconstruction of chronic avulsions of the Achilles tendon is a less invasive technique using a free semitendinosus tendon graft with interference screw fixation in the calcaneus through a Cincinnati incision.

The purpose of the current case study is to report the unilateral presence of double peroneal muscles in the evertors of the foot. The peroneal compartment of an adult Indian male cadaver was dissected during a demonstration class for medical undergraduates. Two bellies of the peroneal longus and brevis muscles were observed. The peroneus longus split into two bellies, superficial and deep, while the brevis displayed superficial/lateral and deep/medial bellies. These additional bellies gained attachment to the lateral calcaneal surface. Disorders of the peroneal tendons provide a basis for lateral ankle pain and instability. Anatomical variants have been associated with lateral ankle diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging can demonstrate these soft tissue variants, and detailed information on the anatomy of the crural region enables a surgeon to plan an operation.

Our null hypothesis was that these two forms of lubricin would have equal lubricating ability. Forty two canine hind-limbs were used. The peroneus longus (PL) tendons were harvested, along with the proximal phalanx and flexor digitorum profundus of the second or fifth digit with its proximal fibro-osseous pulley. Forty PL tendons were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. After gliding resistance testing, two intact PL tendons and two tendons in each group were randomly selected for surface observation with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The variance of the PL saline group mean gliding resistance was significantly different from other groups. There was a significant treatment-cycle interaction effect on the mean gliding resistance. On SEM, the surface of the saline treated PL tendons appeared rough, whereas the other tendon surfaces appeared smooth. Human synoviocyte lubricin functioned as well as bovine synovial fluid lubricin to reduce friction of canine PL tendons in vitro. This data suggest that treatment using the two forms of lubricin are mechanically similar. ? 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

High rates of incidence due to surgical intervention, especially associated with abdominal procedures, have been reported. This chapter gives an introduction to the formation of adhesions, with particular focus on peritoneum, urinary and reproductive (female) systems, tendon, ligament, joint, and pericardium. A number of techniques, treatments, and materials have been proposed for the prevention/reduction of adhesion formation. Of these, barrier methods are considered the only effective method currently available. An overview of biomaterials currently used as barriers for postsurgical tissue adhesion is presented. Current clinical practice utilizes solid membranes/mechanical barriers, spray-on, and gel and liquid barriers. These barriers can be either resorbable, nonresorbable, or a combination of both. Complications of barrier films are examined, and design criteria for barrier membranes are presented. Adhesion formation can be beneficial in particular circumstances, such as for anchoring implants, and these uses are commented upon. Much advancement has been made in this area, thanks to the increasing knowledge and understanding regarding the events that control adhesion formation, but there is still a long way to go before an optimum solution to this problem is found. ? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of muscle activity and ankle joint movement during the side-hop test. J Strength Cond Res 25(8): 2255-2264, 2011-Functional performance tests (FPTs) that consist of movements, such as hopping, landing, and cutting, provide useful measurements. Although some tests have been established for kinematic studies of the knee joint, very few tests have been established for the ankle joint. To use the FPT as a test battery for patients with an ankle sprain, it is necessary to document typical patterns of muscle activation and range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint during FPTs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of the ROM of the ankle inversion/ eversion and the muscle activity of the peroneus longus muscle (PL) and the tibial anterior muscle (TA) in normal subjects during the side-hop test. To emphasize the characteristics of ROM and electromyography (EMG) at each phase, the sidehop tests were divided into 4 phases: lateral-hop contact phase (LC), lateral-hop flight phase (LF), medial hop contact phase (MC), and medial hop flight phase (MF), and the ROM of ankle inversion/eversion, a peak angle of ankle inversion, and Integral EMG (IEMG) of PL and TA compared among 4 phases. Fifteen male subjects with no symptoms of ankle joint problems participated in this research. The ROM of ankle inversion/ eversion during the side-hop test was 27 ñ 3.8ø (mean ñ SD), and there was a significant difference in the ROM of ankle inversion/eversion among 4 phases (p < 0.05). The phase in which the widest ROM was presented was the MF. A peak angle of the ankle inversion at MC was significantly greater than at LC and MF (p <0.05). A peak angle of the ankle inversion at LF was significantly greater than at LC and MF. The PL remained contracting with 50-160% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The IEMGs of PL in both the contact phases were significantly greater than in both the flight phases (p < 0.05). In addition, the PL activity at LC was significantly greater than at MC. The TA remained contracting at 50-80% of MVC through the side-hop test. The IEMG of TA at both the contact phases was significantly greater than at 2 flight phases. However, there was no significant difference between LC and MF.

Since the properties of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) are different between ""fast"" and ""slow"" muscles, we studied the effects of immobilization on the contractile properties and the Nav of rat peroneus longus (PL). The distal tendon of PL was cut and fixed to the adjacent bone at neutral muscle length. After 4 or 8 wk of immobilization, the contractile and the Nav properties were studied and compared with muscles from control animals (Student's t-test). After 4 wk of immobilization, PL showed a faster phenotype with a rightward shift of the force-frequency curve and a decrease in both the Burke's index of fatigability and the tetanus-to-twitch ratio. These parameters showed opposite changes between 4 and 8 wk of immobilization. The maximal sodium current in 4-wk immobilized fibers was higher compared with that of control fibers (11.5 ñ 1.2 vs. 7.8 ñ 0.8 nA, P = 0.008), with partial recovery to the control values in 8-wk immobilized fibers (8.6 ñ 0.7 nA, P = 0.48). In the presence of tetrodotoxin, the maximal residual sodium current decreased continuously throughout immobilization. Using the Western blot analysis, Nav1.4 expression showed a transient increase in 4-wk muscle, whereas Nav1.5 expression decreased during immobilization. Our results indicate that a muscle immobilized at optimal functional length with the preservation of neural inputs exhibits a transient fast phenotype conversion. Nav1.4 expression and current are related to the contractile phenotype variation.

1568,SC-951,Steinau et al. (2011),2011,"Tendon transfers for drop foot correction: Long-term results including quality of life assessment, and dynamometric and pedobarographic measurements","Background Drop foot deformity is a common problem with severe restrictions in quality of life and impairment of daily activities. A technique of posterior tibial tendon transfer through the interosseus membrane and fixation to the anterior tibial and the long peroneal tendon ''Bridle procedure'' (stirrup-plasty) offers a physiological alternative to surgical correction. Methods Data of 53 consecutive patients treated by stirrup- plasty were acquired from patient's charts; 31 were interviewed with standardized questionnaires; 20 were examined physically; 19 received pedobarography, and 8 underwent dynamometric muscle function tests. Follow-up time averaged 6.5 years. Results The mean range of motion (ROM) in the ankle joint was 8ø dorsiflexion and 15ø plantar flexion. Most patients achieved plantigrade foot position and the majority developed gait without orthotic devices. As expected, maximum dorsiflexion torque averaged a third of the nonoperated leg, according to reduced muscle diameter and strength of the transferred muscle. Pressure distribution of the sole during gait was not relevantly altered by the tendon transfer compared to the non-operated leg. Most patients were satisfied with the operative results and reported a significant increase in quality of life. Conclusions Fusion of the transposed posterior tibial, anterior tibial and the peroneus longus tendon prevents drop foot deformity sufficiently. The stirrup mechanism, in combination with tenodesis of the toe extensors, provides a balanced foot and avoids equinovarus and cavus deformity without immobilizing the ankle joint. Improvements in quality of life parameters justify the risk of the operative procedure for the patient. ? 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,10.1007/s00402-010-1231-z,Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery

(2011),2011,Compressive properties of cd-HA-gelatin modified intrasynovial tendon allograft in canine model in vivo,"Although we sometimes use the intrasynovial tendon allograft as a donor, the gliding ability of allograft prepared by lyophilization is significantly decreased. The gliding ability of the grafted tendon after tendon reconstruction is very important because the high gliding resistance causes more adhesion and leads to poor clinical results. We recently revealed that tendon surface treatment with a carbodiimide derivatized HA (cd-HA)-gelatin mixture for intrasynovial tendon allograft significantly improved its gliding ability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether this cd-HA-gelatin treatment affects the tendon mechanical property or not. A total of 40 flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons from canines were evaluated for compressive property by using indentation test. Indentation stiffness was measured for normal tendon, rehydrated tendon after lyophilization, rehydrated tendon after lyophilization that was implanted 6 weeks in vivo, and cd-HA treated rehydrated tendon after lyophilization that was implanted 6 weeks in vivo. The results for all groups showed no significant difference in the tendon compressive properties. The findings of these results demonstrate that cd-HA treatment for intrasynovial tendon allograft is an excellent method to improve the tendon gliding ability after lyophilization without changing the compressive property of donor tendon. ? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.12.030,Journal of Biomechanics

Forty-three fresh legs of 25 adult bodies which had been donated to science were investigated in this study. The mean length of the reference line between the most proximal point of the head of the fibula (PHF) and the most distal point of the malleolus of the fibula (DMF) was 33.4 ñ 2.5 cm. The MEPs of the peroneus longus (PL) and peroneus brevis (PB) gathered from 20 to 40% (7.0-13.0 cm) and 40 to 60%, respectively. The branching point where the nerve was divided to innervate the PL and PB was 10% and 28% from the PHF, respectively. These anatomic results suggest appropriate areas where to inject phenol or other agents for a MEP block in the case of a spastic lower extremity as well as guidelines for an electromyography conduction test. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Scopus,10.1002/ca.21076,Clinical Anatomy

1574,SC-957,Zeugolis et al. (2011),2011,Tendons: Engineering of functional tissues,"Modern advances in medical care have greatly improved survival rate and life expectancy following trauma or degenerative conditions, indirectly leading to an ever-increasing need for functional tissue substitutes to improve quality of life. As tendons have limited regeneration capacity, suitable substitutes are required for reconstruction. The current gold standards in tendon reconstruction are autografts, allografts, or even xenografts. However, the injury of a healthy tissue to obtain the graft and to partially repair the damaged side, the lack of donors and the risk of transmitting disease and/or induce an immunogenic reaction have significantly discouraged their use. Tissue engineering was pioneered as the solely valuable alternative. Advancements in the field allow us to fabricate facsimile that closely imitate the native architecture, remedy a deficit and restore functionality in the living tissue or organ. Indeed, numerous biocompatible and biodegradable constructs of various physical forms have been introduced aiming to provide mechanical stability and a three dimensional template for neotissue formation and organisation. Bioactive materials, materials designed to interact with the body to encourage tissue repair, have also been introduced. Strategies to encourage construct interactions with extracellular matrix components, growth factors and cell surface receptors are being explored. However, for a successful tissue reconstruction, it is of paramount importance to understand how the tissue forms and behaves in vivo. Following that, we need to evaluate how closely we can imitate nature. Only then we will be able to engineer constructs with clinical relevance. This chapter discusses the structural composition of the native tendon and summarises approaches in engineering tendon substitutes. ? Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

1575,SC-958,Han et al. (2011),2011,Effects of 4 weeks of elastic-resistance training on ankle-evertor strength and latency,"Context: Several researchers have suggested that improving evertor strength and peroneus longus reaction time may help alleviate the symptoms of chronic ankle instability and reduce the rate of recurrent ankle sprains. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of a 4-wk elastic-resistance exercise-training program on ankle-evertor strength and peroneus longus latency in subjects with and without a history of ankle sprains (HAS). Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants: 40 subjects (20 male, 20 female; 20 HAS, 20 healthy). Ten subjects (5 male and 5 female) from each of the HAS and healthy groups were randomly assigned to exercise or control groups. Interventions: 4-directional elastic-resistance exercise training 2 times/wk for 4 wk. Main Outcome Measures: Ankle-evertor strength and peroneal muscle latency after sudden inversion were measured before training, after 4 wk of training, and 4 wk posttraining. Results: Four weeks of elastic-resistance exercise training did not elicit significant changes in 1-repetition-maximum ankle-evertor strength between the exercise and control groups (P = .262), HAS and healthy groups (P = .329), or males and females (P = .927). Elastic-resistance exercise training did not elicit significant changes in peroneus longus muscle latency between the exercise and control groups (P = .102), HAS and healthy groups (P = .996), or males and females (P = .947). Conclusions: The 4-wk elastic-resistance exercise training had no effect on ankle-evertor strength and reflex latency of the peroneus longus after unexpected ankle inversion. ? 2011 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.20.2.157,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation
1576,SC-959,Iodice et al. (2011),2011,Acute and cumulative effects of focused high-frequency vibrations on the endocrine system and muscle strength,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute and long-term effects of local high-intensity vibration (HLV, f = 300 Hz) on muscle performance and blood hormone concentrations in healthy young men. Totally 18 subjects (cV group) were studied in two sessions, either without (control) or with HLV treatment. The protocol was the same on both control and test days, except that, in the second session, subjects underwent HLV treatment. Counter-movement jumping (CMJ), maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) test, and hormonal levels were measured before the procedure, immediately thereafter, and 1 h later. To assess the long-term effects of HLV, the cV group was subjected to HLV on the leg muscles for 4 weeks, and a second group (cR group, n = 18) embarked upon a resistance training program. All subjects underwent an MVC test and an isokinetic (100 deg/s) test before training, 4 weeks after training, and 2 months after the end of training. The HLV protocol significantly increased the serum level of growth hormone (GH, P < 0.05) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK, P < 0.05), and decreased the level of cortisol (P < 0.05). None of GH, CPK or testosterone levels were altered in controls. There was a significant improvement in MVC (P < 0.05). After 4 weeks, both the cV and cR groups demonstrated significant improvement in MVC and isokinetic tests (P < 0.05). This increase persisted for at least 2 months. Our results indicate that HLV influences the levels of particular hormones and improves neuromuscular performance. Our results indicate that HLV has a long-term beneficial effect comparable to that of resistance training. ? 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,10.1007/s00421-010-1677-2,European Journal of Applied Physiology
1577,SC-960,Briem et al. (2011),2011,Effects of Kinesio Tape compared with nonelastic sports tape and the untaped ankle during a sudden inversion perturbation in male athletes,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of 2 adhesive tape conditions compared to a no-tape condition on muscle activity of the fibularis longus during a sudden inversion perturbation in male athletes (soccer, team handball, basketball). BACKGROUND: Ankle sprains are common in sports, and the fibularis muscles play a role in providing functional stability of the ankle. Prophylactic ankle taping with nonelastic sports tape has been used to restrict ankle inversion. Kinesio Tape, an elastic sports tape, has not been studied for that purpose. METHODS: Fifty-one male premier-league athletes were tested for functional stability of both ankles with the Star Excursion Balance Test. Based on the results, those with the 15 highest and those with the 15 lowest stability scores were selected for further testing. Muscle activity of the fibularis longus was recorded with surface electromyography during a sudden inversion perturbation. Each participant was tested under 3 conditions: ankle taped with nonelastic white sports tape, ankle taped with Kinesio Tape, and no ankle taping. Differences in mean muscle activity were evaluated with a 3-way mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the 3 conditions, across four 500-millisecond time frames, and between the 2 groups of stable versus unstable participants. Differences in peak muscle activity and in the time to peak muscle activity were evaluated with a 2-way mixed-model ANOVA. RESULTS: Significantly greater mean muscle activity was found when ankles were taped with nonelastic tape compared to no tape, while Kinesio Tape had no significant effect on mean or maximum muscle activity compared to the no-tape condition. Neither stability level nor taping condition had a significant effect on the amount of time from perturbation to maximum activity of the fibularis longus muscle. CONCLUSION: Nonelastic sports tape may enhance dynamic muscle support of the ankle. The efficacy of Kinesio Tape in preventing ankle sprains via the same mechanism is unlikely, as it had no effect on muscle activation of the fibularis longus.",Scopus,10.2519/jospt.2011.3501,Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy

(2010),2010,Improvement of flexor tendon reconstruction with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin-modified intrasynovial allografts: Study of a primary repair failure model,"Background: Tendon grafts play an important role in flexor tendon reconstruction. This study was an investigation of the effects of surface modification of allograft intrasynovial tendons with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin in an in vivo canine model. To mimic the actual clinical situation, a novel and clinically relevant model of a failed primary flexor tendon repair was used to evaluate the flexor tendon grafts. Methods: Twenty-eight flexor digitorum profundus tendons from the second and fifth digits of fourteen dogs were lacerated and repaired in zone II in a first-surgery phase. The dogs were allowed free active motion postoperatively. In a second phase, six weeks later, the tendons were reconstructed with use of a flexor digitorum profundus allograft. In each dog, one graft was treated with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin (the CHG group) and the other was treated with saline solution, as a control. The dogs were restricted from free active motion, but daily therapy was performed beginning on postoperative day 5 and continued until six weeks after the operation, when the animals were killed. The outcomes were evaluated on the basis of digit work of flexion, gliding resistance, healing at the distal attachment, graft cell viability, histological findings, and findings on scanning electron microscopy. Results: In the first phase, all twenty-eight repaired tendons ruptured, with scar and adhesion formation in the repair site. Six weeks after allograft reconstruction, the mean work of flexion was 0.37 and 0.94 N-mm/degree in the CHG group and the saline-solution control group, respectively; these values were significantly different (p < 0.05). The gliding resistance in the CHG group was also significantly less than that in the saline-solution control group (0.18 versus 0.28 N) (p < 0.05), but no difference between groups was observed with regard to the distal tendon-bone pullout strength. Histological analysis showed that tenocytes in the host tendon proliferated and migrated toward the acellular allograft. Conclusions: This primary repair failure model was reproducible and reliable, with a uniform failure pattern, and provides an appropriate and clinically relevant animalmodel with which to study flexor tendon reconstruction. The surface modification of allografts with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin improved digital function and tendon gliding ability.

Once produced this injury, there is a high probability that symptoms during over time, thus becoming a chronic type injury. It is believed that the stabilizing musculature of the joint must be strong enough to counteract the mechanism of this injury. The aim of this study was to compare the reaction time of the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis and tibialis anterior in unstable and healthy functionally ankles. Methods: Subjects: participated in the study a total of 33 subjects divided into two groups: GI (n = 17) with instability functional in one of theirs ankles, and GC (n = 16) with healthy ankles. Variables: The variables studied were the reaction time of the three muscles, the maximum peak of EMG during inversion time, the average muscle activation of inversion time and the inversion duration. It examined the anthropometric variables (height, weight, skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, leg skeletal muscle mass under study) of the subjects. Protocol: first we made the body composition test, later to perform the of maximum voluntary contraction of the three muscles test and finally the inversion ankle test. Results: GI had a significantly longer reaction time in the peroneus longus and brevis (57 ms and 57.2 ms respectively) than the CG (46.3 ms and 47.6 ms). There were no significant differences in tibialis anterior. Conclusions: functional ankle instability causes an increase in reaction times of the muscle stabilized ankle, increasing the risk of reinjury.",Scopus,0,Archivos de Medicina del Deporte

(2010),2010,Gender-specific neuromuscular activity of the M. peroneus longus in healthy runners - A descriptive laboratory study,"Background: Gender-specific neuromuscular activity for the ankle (e.g., peroneal muscle) is currently not known. This knowledge may contribute to the understanding of overuse injury mechanisms. The purpose was therefore to analyse the neuromuscular activity of the peroneal muscle in healthy runners. Methods: Fifty-three male and 54 female competitive runners were tested on a treadmill at 3.33 m s-1. Neuromuscular activity of the M. peroneus longus was measured by electromyography and analysed in the time domain (onset of activation, time of maximum of activation, total time of activation) in % of stride time in relation to touchdown (= 1.0). Additionally, mean amplitudes for the gait cycle phases preactivation, weight acceptance and push-off were calculated and normalised to the mean activity of the entire gait cycle. Findings: Onset of activation (mean; female: 0.86/male: 0.90, p < 0.0001) and time of maximum of activation (female: 1.13/male: 1.16, p < 0.0001) occurred earlier in female compared to male and the total time of activation was longer in women (female: 0.42/male: 0.39, p = 0.0036). In preactivation, women showed higher amplitudes (+ 21%) compared to men (female: 1.16/male: 0.92, p < 0.0001). Activity during weight acceptance (female: 2.26/male: 2.41, p = 0.0039) and push-off (female: 0.93/male: 1.07, p = 0.0027) were higher in men. Interpretation: Activation strategies of the peroneal muscle appear to be gender-specific. Higher preactivation amplitudes in females indicate a different neuromuscular control in anticipation of touchdown (""pre-programmed activity""). These data may help interpret epidemiologically reported differences between genders in overuse injury frequency and localisation. ? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Plain radiographs revealed no bony abnormality around the foot or ankle, but a sessile exophytic bony growth at the proximal fibula. A positive Tinel sign in this area led us to a suspicion of compressive neuropathy of the peroneal nerve, and a subsequent electrophysiologic study confirmed the entrapment neuropathy. The peroneal nerve was decompressed by excisional biopsy. At 3 months postoperatively, normal full extension of the great toe was completely restored. The current case deserves attention in that the only clinical manifestation of peroneal nerve entrapment neuropathy by the osteochondroma at the fibular neck was extension loss of great toe. ? 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,10.1007/s00402-009-0944-3,Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery

The proposed EMG-to-moment model took into account realistic muscle properties such as the electromechanical delay, and a force-length-velocity relationship with subjectspecific muscle anthropometric data. Subjects performed isometric ankle plantar-flexion (fixed-end contraction) and dynamic tasks (heel-raise) in two positions, seated and upright. Two models were compared: the proposed EMGto-moment model calibrated on eight dynamic and isometric tasks (Model 8-tasks) and on two dynamic tasks (Model 2-tasks), and a published reference model. First, each model was calibrated at the ankle joint on 10 subjects by adjusting individual set of parameters to estimate the muscle groups contributions. Then, the model was used to predict the ankle net joint moment. The model developed in this study showed good prediction. The Model 8-tasks predicted net joint moment with an average RMS error of 6.11 ñ 4.41 N m and a mean R2 of 0.67 ñ 0.26 across dynamic and isometric tasks. The proposed EMG-to-moment model was simple and required few calibration tasks without oversimplifying muscle properties, satisfying requirements for clinical settings. ? 2010 Biomedical Engineering Society.",Scopus,10.1007/s10439-010-9987-4,Annals of Biomedical Engineering

METHODS: ACL reconstructions with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone were performed in 18 patients (18 knees)in the study from March 2007 to July 2009. Among the patients,14 patients were male and 4 patients were female, ranging in age from 21 to 47 years, with an average of 35.5 years. Twelve patients had the injuries in the right knee and 6 patients in the left knee. The CT scans were taken in a consistent manner at the 1st week and the 3rd, 6th, 12th months after surgery to measure tibial and femoral tunnel expansion. RESULTS: Tunnel enlargement didn't happen in 18 knees. The average enlargement of 18 cases of femoral tunnel was (1.10 +/- 0.42) mm; and the average enlargement of 18 cases of tibial tunnel was (1.00 +/- 0.51) mm. There was statistical significance of femoral tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); and there were no significant difference of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and the 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05). There was statistical significance of tibial tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); there were no significant differences of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone could obviously reduce the incidence of tunnel enlargement.

1586,SC-969,Howatson et al. (2010),2010,The impact of damaging exercise on electromechanical delay in biceps brachii,"Electromechanical delay (EMD) can be a useful tool in providing information on muscle function changes following a number of exercise interventions. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of damaging exercise on EMD. Twelve volunteers completed 45 maximal lengthening contractions of the elbow flexors. Indices of muscle damage (maximum voluntary isometric torque and isokinetic torque (60s-1 and 210s-1), creatine kinase (CK), muscle soreness (DOMS)) were recorded pre-exercise, 48h and 96h post-exercise; electromyography was recorded from the belly of biceps brachii and EMD was determined during each contraction condition. Significant time effects were observed for all damage indices (P<0.05). Whilst muscle function was close to full recovery at 96h, both CK and DOMS were significantly (P<0.001) elevated above baseline. EMD was significantly greater at 96h for all contraction conditions (Pó0.017), but not at 48h. Damaging exercise induces alterations in EMD beyond the apparent recovery of maximal voluntary contractions, which is likely to be a reflection of the changes in post-synaptic events.

(2010),2010,Reliability and interpretation of single leg stance and maximum voluntary isometric contraction methods of electromyography normalization,"Normalization of electromyographic (EMG) amplitudes is necessary in the study of human motion. However, there is a lack of agreement on the most reliable and appropriate normalization method. This study evaluated the reliability of single leg stance (SLS) and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) normalization methods and the relationship between these measures for the gluteus maximus (GMax), gluteus medius (GMed), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), hip adductor group (ADD), and biceps femoris (BF). Surface EMG was recorded in 20 subjects during three 5. s trials of SLS and MVIC. SLS and MVIC methods both demonstrated good-to-excellent reliability in all muscles (ICCs > 0.80). Intrasubject coefficients of variation were lower for the MVIC method (9-36%) than for the SLS method (20-59%). EMG amplitudes during MVIC and SLS were significantly correlated for all muscles (Pearson r's=0.604-0.905, p<0.005) except GMax (r=0.250, p=0.288). Use of SLS normalization for the RF, VL, and BF is not recommended due to a lack of measurement precision. However, this method is justified in the GMax, GMed, and ADD and may provide a better representation of coordinated muscle function during a functional task. ? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2009.08.003,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology

(2010),2010,"Age-related changes of elements in the tendons of the peroneus longus muscles in Thai, Japanese, and Monkeys","To elucidate compositional changes of the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle with aging, the authors investigated age-related changes of elements in the insertion of tendons of the peroneus longus muscle (peroneus longus tendons) in Thai, Japanese, and monkeys and the relationships among element contents by direct chemical analysis. After ordinary dissections at Chiang Mai University and Nara Medical University were finished, the peroneus longus tendons were resected from the subjects. The peroneus longus tendons were also resected from rhesus and Japanese monkeys bred in Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University. The wraparound regions of the insertion tendons of the peroneus longus muscle in contact with the cuboid bone were used as the peroneus longus tendon. After ashing with nitric acid and perchloric acid, element contents were determined with an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer. It was found that there were no significant correlations between age and the seven elements, such as Ca, P, S, Mg, Zn, Fe, and Na, in the peroneus longus tendons of Thai and Japanese. The Ca content higher than 10 mg/g was contained in seven cases out of 34 peroneus longus tendons of Thai (incidence=20.6%) and in one case out of 22 peroneus longus tendons of Japanese (incidence=4.5%), respectively. All of the peroneus longus tendons with the Ca content higher than 10 mg/g were found in Thai and Japanese men. In the peroneus longus tendons of monkeys, the Ca and P content increased suddenly at 2 years of age and reached to about 40 mg/g at 5 years of age. Thereafter, the Ca and P content did not increase in the peroneus longus tendons of monkeys at old age. Regarding the relationships among element contents, significant direct correlations were found among the contents of Ca, P, Mg, Zn, and Na in Thai and monkeys, whereas significant inverse correlations were found between S and element contents, such as Ca, P, Mg, Zn, and Na, in Thai and monkeys. ?Humana Press Inc. 2009.",Scopus,10.1007/s12011-009-8442-6,Biological Trace Element Research
1590,SC-973,Takahashi et al. (2010),2010,Asynchronous muscle and tendon adaptation after surgical tensioning procedures,"Background: Donor muscles are often highly stretched in tendon transfer surgery. Despite literature reports that showed adaptation of the serial sarcomere number to moderate stretch, little is known regarding adaptation to stretch outside of the physiological range (commonly seen in clinical tendon transfer). This study was performed to evaluate muscle-tendon-unit adaptation to tendon transfer surgery in an animal model. Methods: Thirty-seven male New Zealand White rabbits were used for muscle analysis, and twenty-five of those rabbits were also used for biological analysis of the tendons after the experiment. The extensor digitorum muscle of the second toe was transferred at a specific sarcomere length of 3.7 mm, chosen to be near the end of the descending limb of the rabbit sarcomere length-tension curve. Animals were killed at five time points, at which complete muscle architectural analysis as well as measurements of tendon dimension, tendon water content, and tendon cytokine transcript levels were performed. Results: As expected, a rapid increase in the serial sarcomere number (mean and standard error of the mean, 4658 ñ 154 in the transferred muscle compared with 3609 ñ 80 in the control muscle) was found one week after the surgery. From this time point until eight weeks, this increased serial sarcomere number paradoxically decreased, while the sarcomere length remained constant. Eventually, at eight weeks, it reached the same value (3749 ñ 83) as that in the control muscle (3767 ñ 61). Tendon adaptation was delayed relative to muscle adaptation, but it was no less dramatic. Tendon length increased by 1.43 ñ 0.74 mm over the eight-week time period, corresponding to a strain of 15.55% ñ 4.08%. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of biphasic adaptation of the serial sarcomere number followed by tendon adaptation, and it indicates that muscle adapts more quickly than tendon does. Taken together, these results illustrate a complex and unique interaction between muscles and tendons that occurs during adaptation to stretching during tendon transfer. Clinical Relevance: Understanding the time course of muscle-tendon-unit adaptation can provide surgeons with information to guide postoperative care following tendon transfers as well as guidelines for tensioning muscles during tendon transfer.

(2010),2010,Free hamstrings tendon transfer and interference screw fixation for less invasive reconstruction of chronic avulsions of the Achilles tendon,"Reconstruction of chronic avulsions of the Achilles tendon can be technically difficult, as the calcaneus can be totally denuded of tendon, or only a small tuft of frayed tissue may have remain attached to the calcaneus, and be inadequate to allow a direct repair. In these patients, if it is not possible to directly reattach the Achilles tendon, a tendon graft can be necessary. We developed a less invasive technique using a free semitendinosus tendon graft with interference screw fixation in the calcaneus through a Cincinnati incision. Using this approach, a wide exposure of the insertion of the Achilles tendon is possible, preserving the integrity of the skin overlying the site most prone to wound breakdown. ? 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-009-0968-9,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"

The purpose of the present study was to test the hypotheses that an intrasynovial tendon prepared with repetitive freeze-thaw cycles and lyophilization (as a means of reducing immunogenicity) has increased frictional force (gliding resistance) in comparison with fresh intrasynovial tendons and that a lyophilized intrasynovial flexor tendon that is modified with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin has decreased frictional force in comparison with untreated lyophilized tendons. Methods: Thirty-six flexor digitorum profundus tendons from the second and fifth digits of canine hind paws were randomly assigned to three groups. Twelve tendons were immediately assessed both mechanically and morphologically and served as the normal tendon group. The other twenty-four tendons were prepared with repetitive freeze-thaw cycles and lyophilization and were randomly assigned to two groups, including one group in which the tendons were treated with carbodiimide- derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin and one group in which the tendons were not treated. The frictional force was measured during 1000 cycles of simulated flexion-extension motion in all tendons, and the mean frictional forces were compared. The tendons were then observed with use of transmitted light microscopy for residual hyaluronic acid on the tendon surface, and the smoothness of the surface was evaluated with use of scanning electron microscopy. Results: The frictional force after lyophilization was significantly increased by 104.9% after the first cycle and by 99.5% after 1000 cycles in comparison with the normal tendon (p < 0.05). The frictional force of the lyophilized tendons after treatment with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin was not significantly different from that of normal tendons. The untreated lyophilized tendon surfaces were observed on scanning electron microscopy to be rough in appearance, whereas the normal surface and the surface treated with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin were smooth, with residual hyaluronic acid present on the gliding surface. Conclusions: Lyophilization alters tendon surface morphology and increases tendon frictional force. Surface modification with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin can mitigate this adverse effect. Clinical Relevance: Tendon surface modification with carbodiimide-derivatized hyaluronic acid and gelatin can improve the gliding ability of lyophilized flexor tendons and therefore may improve the utility of lyophilized tendon allografts as a tendon graft substitute.

Methods: Eighteen fascia lata specimens were harvested from 11 donors and fan folded through a proprietary process. Bonepatellar tendonbone (BPTB), tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus tendons were harvested from 4 additional donors. All soft-tissue grafts were tested to failure in an MTS machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) in a single-looped fashion. BPTB grafts were similarly clamped in freeze grips. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness were calculated for each graft type tested. Results: The mean ultimate load to failure was 3,266 N and stiffness was 414 N/mm for the single-looped fascia lata grafts (n = 18). There was no significant difference for ultimate load to failure and stiffness between the fascia lata and tibialis anterior (3,012 N and 342 N/mm, respectively), tibialis posterior (3,666 N and 392 N/mm, respectively), and peroneus longus (3,050 N and 346 N/mm, respectively) tendons. The fascia lata grafts performed significantly better (P < .001) than BPTB (1,404 N and 224 N/mm, respectively). Conclusions: A single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft has, on biomechanical testing, initial ultimate tensile strength (3,266 N) and stiffness values equivalent to or better than several other graft tissues currently used in ACL reconstruction, including BPTB (1,403 N), tibialis anterior (3,012 N), tibialis posterior (3,666 N), and peroneus longus (3,050 N). Clinical Relevance: In the face of potential allograft tissue shortages and increasing constraints on health care expenditures, the use of fascia lata has the potential to be a readily available graft for ACL reconstruction that performs as well as other grafts and at a comparable or lower cost. ? 2010 Arthroscopy Association of North America.",Scopus,10.1016/j.arthro.2010.03.019,Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery

A focused plyometric training program may decrease the muscle's reaction time. Objective: To determine the effect of a 6-wk plyometric training program on peroneus longus reaction time. Design: Repeated measures. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: 48 healthy volunteers (age 20.0 ñ 1.2 y, height 176.1 ñ 16.9 cm, weight 74.5 ñ 27.9 kg) from a large Midwestern university. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a training group or a control group. Interventions: Independent variables were group at 2 levels (training and no training) and time at 2 levels (pretest and posttest). The dependent variable was peroneal latency measured with surface electromyography. A custom-made trapdoor device capable of inverting the ankle to 30ø was also used. Latency data were obtained from the time the trapdoor dropped until the peroneus longus muscle activated. Peroneal latency was measured before and after the 6-wk training period. The no-training group was instructed to maintain current activities. The training group performed a 6-wk plyometric protocol 3 times weekly. Data were examined with a repeated-measures ANOVA with 1 within-subject factor (time at 2 levels) and 1 between-subjects factor (group at 2 levels). A priori alpha level was set at P ó .05. Main Outcome Measures: Pretest and posttest latency measurements (ms) were recorded for the peroneus longus muscle. Results: The study found no significant group-by-time interaction (F<inf>1,46</inf> = 0.03, P = .87). In addition, there was no difference between the pretest and posttest values (pretest = 61.76 ñ 14.81 ms, posttest = 59.24 ñ 12.28 ms; P = .18) and no difference between the training and no-training groups (training group = 59.10 ñ 12.18 ms, no-training group = 61.79 ñ 15.18 ms; P = .43). Conclusions: Although latency measurements were consistent with previous studies, the plyometric training program did not cause significant change in the peroneus longus reaction time. ? 2010 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.19.3.288,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation
1597,SC-980,Tan et al. (2010),2010,Novel reconstruction of a static medial ligamentous complex in a flatfoot model,"Background: Little progress has been made addressing reconstruction of the static medial ligamentous structures of the foot. The purpose of this investigation was to reconstruct a flatfoot deformity with a novel static medial ligamentous complex (MLC) and evaluate its ability to correct talar head subluxation and radiographic deformity in a cadaveric model. Materials and Methods: Eight fresh frozen cadaveric specimens underwent cyclic preconditioning and static axial loading. Loading was applied to the intact foot, the severe flatfoot, and the reconstructed MLC foot. Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs were taken at each stage. The talo-first metatarsal angle, medial cuneiform height, talocalcaneal angle, and the calcaneal pitch angle were measured on the lateral views and the talo-first metatarsal angle was measured on the anteroposterior views. Results: Compared with the intact foot, the flatfoot showed significant change in the AP talo-first metatarsal angle (p = 0.001), the lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (p = 0.002), the medial cuneiform height (p = 0.007), the talocalcaneal angle (p = 0.03), and the calcaneal pitch angle (p = 0.018). After MLC reconstruction, there was a significant change in the AP talo-first metatarsal angle (p = 0.001), the lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (p = 0.002), and the medial cuneiform height (p = 0.007) and these values were not significantly different than the intact foot. The talocalcaneal angle and the calcaneal pitch angle remained significantly undercorrected after static MLC reconstruction. Conclusion: Static MLC reconstruction was effective in correcting several key radiographic parameters in a cadaveric flatfoot model. Clinical Relevance: The surgical technique evaluated here may be useful as a new soft tissue reconstructive procedure for treating adult flatfoot.

(2010),2010,Kinematics of gait in Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy,"The goal of this study was to quantify the two-dimensional kinematics of pathologic gait during over-ground walking at a self-selected speed at the stifle (knee) and hock (ankle) joints in six Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy (GRMD) dogs and six carrier littermates (controls). We found that GRMD dogs walked significantly slower than controls (p < 0.01). At the stifle joint, both groups displayed similar ROM (range of motion), but compared to controls, GRMD dogs walked with the stifle joint relatively more extended. At the hock joint, GRMD dogs displayed less ROM (range of motion) and walked with the joint relatively less flexed compared to controls. We controlled for gait speed in all analyses, so the differences we observed in joint kinematics between groups cannot be attributed solely to the slower walking speed of the GRMD dogs. This is the first kinematic study of gait in the GRMD dog, an important step in using this model in pre-clinical trials. ? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Clinically applicable animal models have been developed to test novel treatments prior to clinical use. Initial research efforts focused on improving the biomechanics of the suture repair and reducing adhesions during healing through passive motion rehabilitation. Recent trends for flexor tendon repair include biological and biomaterial approaches to improve healing. Treatment of the tendon surface with natural and synthetic materials has led to dramatic improvements in the gliding properties of the tendons, and hence the function of the digit. Development of biofactor delivery systems has allowed investigators to test the effects of growth factors for enhanced flexor tendon healing. Application of these new biomaterials to intrasynovial flexor tendon repair has the potential to improve both tendon function (by improving the gliding properties of the tendon) and tendon strength (by enhancing extracellular matrix synthesis). ? 2009 Springer-Verlag Milan.",Scopus,10.1007/978-88-470-1195-3_8,0
1600,SC-983,Wang et al. (2009),2009,Anatomic reconstruction of neglected achilles tendon rupture with autogenous peroneal longus tendon by endoButton fixation,"Background: Neglected or chronic rupture of the Achilles tendon usually needs a reconstruction procedure. Many graft sources have been reported for this procedure, such as a proximal V-Y gastrocnemius tendon flap, flexor hallucis longus tendon, fascia lata, plantaris tendon, synthetic materials, and peroneus brevis. However, how to fix the graft at the calcaneal site remains controversial. Methods: An alternative technique to anatomically reconstruct the Achilles tendon using an autogenous peroneal longus tendon with EndoButton-CL fixation at the calcaneal site for treatment of a patient who had a chronic neglected rupture of the Achilles tendon is described. Results: The patient was allowed to begin gentle exercise, such as swimming and cycling 12 weeks after surgery, and encouraged to augment rehabilitation of hindfoot eversion and ankle plantar flexion. The ankle plantar flexion and hindfoot eversion strength was not reduced after active rehabilitation in 2.5 years of follow-up. ConclusionS: Our technique reuses two small central incisions, thus, preserving skin integrity as much as possible to reduce wound breakdown or infection. The management of chronic or neglected Achilles tendon rupture by autogenous peroneal longus tendon with EndoButton-CL fixation at the calcaneal site is an anatomic and safe, but technically demanding technique.

Improvement of stance control and muscle performance induced by focal muscle vibration in young-elderly women: a randomized controlled trial. Objective: To determine the effect of a particular protocol of mechanical vibration, applied focally and repeatedly (repeated muscle vibration [rMV]) on the quadriceps muscles, on stance and lower-extremity muscle power of young-elderly women. Design: Double-blind randomized controlled trial; 3-month follow-up after intervention. Setting: Human Physiology Laboratories, University of Perugia, Italy. Participants: Sedentary women volunteers (N=60), randomized in 3 groups (mean age ñ SD, 65.3ñ4.2y; range, 60-72). Intervention: rMV (100Hz, 300-500?m, in three 10-minute sessions a day for 3 consecutive days) was applied to voluntary contracted quadriceps (vibrated and contracted group) and relaxed quadriceps (vibrated and relaxed group). A third group received placebo stimulation (nonvibrated group). Main Outcome Measures: Area of sway of the center of pressure, vertical jump height, and leg power. Results: Twenty-four hours after the end of the complete series of applications, the area of sway of the center of pressure decreased significantly by approximately 20%, vertical jump increased by approximately 55%, and leg power increased by approximately 35%. These effects were maintained for at least 90 days after treatment. Conclusions: rMV is a short-lasting and noninvasive protocol that can significantly and persistently improve muscle performance in sedentary young-elderly women. ? 2009 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.",Scopus,10.1016/j.apmr.2009.08.139,Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
1602,SC-985,Palmieri-Smith et al. (2009),2009,Peroneal activation deficits in persons with functional ankle instability,"Background: Functional ankle instability (FAI) may be prevalent in as many as 40% of patients after acute lateral ankle sprain. Altered afference resulting from damaged mechanoreceptors after an ankle sprain may lead to reflex inhibition of surrounding joint musculature. This activation deficit, referred to as arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), may be the underlying cause of FAI. Incomplete activation could prevent adequate control of the ankle joint, leading to repeated episodes of instability. Hypothesis: Arthrogenic muscle inhibition is present in the peroneal musculature of functionally unstable ankles and is related to dynamic peroneal muscle activity. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Twenty-one (18 female, 3 male) patients with unilateral FAI and 21 (18 female, 3 male) uninjured, matched controls participated in this study. Peroneal maximum H-reflexes and M-waves were recorded bilaterally to establish the presence or absence of AMI, while electromyography (EMG) recorded as patients underwent a sudden ankle inversion perturbation during walking was used to quantify dynamic activation. The H:M ratio and average EMG amplitudes were calculated and used in data analyses. Two-way analyses of variance were used to compare limbs and groups. A regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between the H:M ratio and the EMG amplitudes. Results: The FAI patients had larger peroneal H:M ratios in their nonpathological ankle (0.399 ñ 0.185) than in their pathological ankle (0.323 ñ 0.161) ( P =.036), while no differences were noted between the ankles of the controls (0.442 ñ 0.176 and 0.425 ñ 0.180). The FAI patients also exhibited lower EMG after inversion perturbation in their pathological ankle (1.7 ñ 1.3) than in their uninjured ankle (EMG, 3.3 ñ 3.1) (P <.001), while no differences between legs were noted for controls (P >"" xbd=""1958"" xhg=""1938"" ybd=""1851"" yhg=""1826""/>.05). No significant relationship was found between the peroneal H:M ratio and peroneal EMG (P >.05). Conclusion: Arthrogenic muscle inhibition is present in the peroneal musculature of persons with FAI but is not related to dynamic muscle activation as measured by peroneal EMG amplitude. Reversing AMI may not assist in protecting the ankle from further episodes of instability; however dynamic muscle activation (as measured by peroneal EMG amplitude) should be restored to maximize ankle stabilization. Dynamic peroneal activity is impaired in functionally unstable ankles, which may contribute to recurrent joint instability and may leave the ankle vulnerable to injurious loads. ? 2009 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1177/0363546508330147,American Journal of Sports Medicine

The procedure uses a split peroneus longus tendon to recreate the calcaneofibular and anterior talofibular ligaments. The new ligaments follow a precise anatomic course that replicates the pathway of the original ligaments. The procedure also capitalizes on interference screw technology so that accurate ligament tension can be obtained. This technique is most useful for severe ligamentous insufficiency involving both the calcaneofibular and anterior talofibular ligaments.

Eleven volunteers that were unfamiliar with isokinetic dynamometry participated in this study and were asked to attend the laboratory on five consecutive days. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to exercise the elbow flexors under isometric, slow (60ø s-1) and fast (210ø s-1) isokinetic conditions; surface electromyography was recorded from the belly of biceps brachii and the signal was synchronised with the dynamometer to determine EMD. Intra-subject reliability for all measures was good (CV range, 3.1-6.5%) with no discernable difference between the dominant and non-dominant arms during isometric and isokinetic conditions. In addition, there was little difference in EMD and torque variability between the dominant and non-dominant arms which may have applications for clinicians and future research design when monitoring and investigating human muscle function. These data provide researchers and clinicians with an indication of the magnitude of change that is required to elucidate the presence of a meaningful change to muscle function in the elbow flexors. ? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

(2009),2009,Finite-element simulation of flexor digitorum longus or flexor digitorum brevis tendon transfer for the treatment of claw toe deformity,"Claw toe deformity sometimes leads to dorsiflexion of the metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) and plantar flexion of the proximal (PIPJ) and distal interphalangeal (DIPJ) joints. Flexor digitorum longus tendon transfer (FDL) is currently the gold standard for the correction of this problem. Transfer of the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) has been recently proposed as an alternative method to treat such deformity. The aim of this work is to compare the biomechanical outcome of these two methods by means of finite-element simulation. The results show that the reduction in the dorsal displacement of the proximal phalanx (PP) for the second and third toes were very similar (about 4.3 mm for each intervention), both achieving a significant reduction in MPJ dorsiflexion when compared to no intervention (displacements are reduced by approximately 51%). In the fourth and fifth toes, only a small correction in the deformity was achieved with both the techniques (10% and 7%, respectively). FDB and FDL tendon transfer reduced the stress level when compared with the non-operated pathologic foot (the reduction of stresses for the second and third PP ranged between 20% and 40%). FDB transfer resulted in a more uniform distribution of stress along the entire toe, although differences were small in all cases. These results confirm that both the tendon-transfer techniques are effective in the treatment of claw toe deformity. Therefore, the choice of technique is at the discretion of the surgeon. ? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.04.031,Journal of Biomechanics
1606,SC-989,Eechaute et al. (2009),2009,Reliability and discriminative validity of sudden ankle inversion measurements in patients with chronic ankle instability,"Background: Studies investigating peroneal muscle reaction times in chronically unstable ankle joints present conflicting results. The degree of reliability and accuracy of these measurements is unknown in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Methods: 40 patients with CAI and 30 healthy subjects were tested using a sudden ankle inversion of 50ø while standing on a trapdoor device. Sudden ankle inversion measurements were registered using electromyography, accelerometry and electrogoniometry. For reliability testing, intra-class coefficients (ICCs; model 3,1) and standard errors of measurements of the latency time, motor response time and electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle, the time and angular position of onset of decelerations, the mean and maximum inversion speed and the total inversion time were calculated in 15 patients with CAI. To assess between-group differences, t-tests for independent samples (p < .05) were used. Results: ICCs ranged from .20 (angular position of onset of the second deceleration) to .98 (electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle). Significant between-group differences were observed in only 2 of the 12 variables (for the electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle, p = .001; time of onset of the second deceleration, p = .040). Conclusions: The latency time and motor response time of the peroneus longus muscle, the total inversion time and the mean inversion speed demonstrate acceptable reliability in healthy subjects and patients. The latency time and motor response time of the peroneus longus muscle are not delayed in patients with CAI. Ankle inversion measurements are not discriminative for CAI. ? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

1607,SC-990,Razik Ibrahim et al. (2009),2009,Surgical Treatment of Chronic Achilles Tendon Rupture,"Chronic Achilles tendon ruptures are often challenging to repair because of muscle and tendon atrophy, retraction, and short distal stumps. We undertook a retrospective investigation of 14 patients who were treated with the Ligament Advanced Reinforcement System (LARS) ligament for the treatment of chronic, neglected rupture of the Achilles tendon. The patients pursued a course of early functional rehabilitation, and postoperative outcome scores were obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months, based on the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle and hindfoot scoring system, and the Tegner Activity score. The minimum duration of follow-up was 36 months. After a minimum of 28 months postoperative, and up to 41 months postoperative, there was no observed incidence of rerupture or recurrent pain. The mean time to return to full activity was 18.3 ñ 2.7 weeks, and >90% of the patients scored ò80 points on the AOFAS scoring scale. Specifically, the mean AOFAS score increased from 48.64 ñ 12.67 to 85.86 ñ 6.6 after the operation, and this difference was statistically significant (P = .001). Furthermore, the Tegner activity scale score improved from 2.58 ñ 0.31 to 1.73 ñ 0.29 after the operation, and this difference was also statistically significant (P = .001). The results of this retrospective clinical study suggest that augmentation with the LARS ligament offers a satisfactory reconstructive option for the neglected Achilles tendon rupture.

(2009),2009,Allogenic tendon transplantation for reconstruction of plantar fascia in 32 cases,"The article retrospective analyzed the cases of 32 patients with planter fascia defects from Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical College. All the patients were reconstructed plantar fascia by allogenic tendon, so as to recover the appearance and reserve the function of foot utmost. The operation was performed in two stages. 1 The wound surface of foot sole was repaired at the first stage. According to the condition of foot sole injury, the wound surface was repaired by media leg skin flap in 20 patients, and the avulsed skin flap was sutured in situ in the other 12 patients. 2 The second stage operation was performed at 1 month after the wound surface healed completely. According to the injury of planter fascia, the planter fascia that completely defect was reconstructed by 3 allogenic tendons in 26 patients, and the plantar fascia that partly defect was repaired by 2 allogenic tendons in the other 6 patients. The steel wires were used for ancillary fixation at the same time. At 6 weeks after operation, functional exercises were performed. At 6 months after operation, the steel wires were taken out. No rejection was appeared in all the patients and all wounds were healed by first intention. At 6-month follow-up after operation, 26 patients could walk by helping of crutches, and X-ray showed the foot arch maintained better. At 1-year follow-up after operation, all the patients could walk as normal, and X-ray showed the foot arch had no obvious changes. At 2-year follow-up after operation, all the patients were satisfied with the appearance and function of foot, and X-ray showed the foot arch is normal. Results suggested that reconstruction of plantar fascia by allogenic tendon can recover the structure and function of foot without sacrificing normal tissue and adhesion of tendon.

(2009),2009,Biomechanical variables associated with Achilles tendinopathy in runners,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics, kinematics and muscle activity in runners with Achilles tendinopathy. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Biomechanics laboratory. Participants: 21 runners free from injury and 21 runners with Achilles tendinopathy performed 10 running trials with standardised running shoes. Injured runners were diagnosed clinically according to established diagnostic criteria. Uninjured runners had been injury-free for at least 2 years. Main outcome measurements: During each trial, kinetic and lower limb kinematic data were measured using a strain gauge force plate and six infrared cameras respectively. Electromyographic (EMG) data from six muscles (tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PE), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF) and gluteus medius (GM)) were measured with a telemetric EMG system. Results: Knee range of motion (heel strike to midstance) was significantly lower in injured runners than in uninjured runners. Similarly, preactivation (integrated EMG (IEMG) in 100 ms before heel strike) of TA was lower for injured runners than uninjured runners. RF and GM IEMG activity 100 ms after heel strike was also lower in the injured group. However, impact forces were not different between the two groups. Conclusion: Altered knee kinematics and reduced muscle activity are associated with Achilles tendinopathy in runners. Rehabilitation exercises or other mechanisms (e.g. footwear) that affect kinematics and muscle activity may therefore be beneficial in the treatment of runners with Achilles tendinopathy.",Scopus,10.1136/bjsm.2008.053421,British Journal of Sports Medicine
1610,SC-993,Jackson et al. (2009),2009,The effect of fatigue and habituation on the stretch reflex of the ankle musculature,"Many ankle injuries are said to occur when athletes are in a fatigued state; therefore, studies investigating the role that fatigue plays in ankle injuries are warranted. Furthermore, the contributions of the stretch reflex in countering the injury mechanism are still unclear. We hypothesized that (1) fatigue would impair the reflex response, (2) there would be no differences between genders, (3) habituation would be present, and (4) fatigue would exacerbate the effect of habituation. Forty healthy subjects participated and were divided into treatment and control groups. Stretch reflex measurements were taken for the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), and peroneus brevis (PB) muscles in response to a rapid inversion perturbation. A fatigue intervention was administered to the treatment group, while the control group sat quietly. Post-test measurements were recorded within 5 min and reflex latency (RL) and amplitude (RA) were calculated. RA decreased significantly, however a significant improvement was noted in RL in the PL and PB muscles. The effect that peripheral fatigue has on RL should not be considered a cause of ankle injuries. However, the diminished RA may suggest reduced dynamic stability after fatigue. Habituation was present and was exacerbated by fatigue, indicating that reflex testing is affected by fatigue and habituation, which must be taken into consideration in future studies.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jelekin.2007.06.016,Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology

1612,SC-995,Gorgey et al. (2009),2009,Effects of electrical stimulation parameters on fatigue in skeletal muscle,"STUDY DESIGN: Experimental laboratory study, OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose was to investigate the independent effects of current amplitude, pulse duration, and current frequency on muscle fatigue during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). A second purpose was to determine if the ratio of the evoked torque to the activated area could explain muscle fatigue. BACKGROUND: Parameters of NMES have been shown to differently affect the evoked torque and the activated area. The efficacy of NMES is limited by the rapid onset of muscle fatigue. METHODS AND MEASURES: Seven healthy participants underwent 4 NMES protocols that were randomly applied to the knee extensor muscle group. The NMES protocols were as follows: standard protocol (Std), defined as 100-Hz, 450-?s pulses and amplitude set to evoke 75% of maximal voluntary isometric torque (MVIT); short pulse duration protocol (SP), defined as 100-Hz, 150-?s pulses and amplitude set to evoke 75% of MVIT; low-frequency protocol (LF), defined as 25-Hz, 450-?s pulses and amplitude set to evoke 75% of MVIT; and low-amplitude protocol (LA), defined as 100-Hz, 450-?s pulses and amplitude set to evoke 45% of MVIT The peak torque was measured at the start and at the end of the 4 protocols, and percent fatigue was calculated. The outcomes of the 4 NMES protocols on the initial peak torque and activated cross-sectional area were recalculated from a companion study to measure torque per active area. RESULTS: Decreasing frequency from 100 to 25 Hz decreased fatigue from 76% to 39%. Decreasing the amplitude and pulse duration resulted in no change of muscle fatigue. Torque per active area accounted for 57% of the variability in percent fatigue between Std and LF protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Altering the amplitude of the current and pulse duration does not appear to influence the percent fatigue in NMES. Lowering the stimulation frequency results in less fatigue, by possibly reducing the evoked torque relative to the activated muscle area.",Scopus,10.2519/jospt.2009.3045,Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy
1613,SC-996,Zinder et al.

The mechanism for this decrease is not clearly understood. Examining the effects of ankle bracing on biomechanical stability and influencing factors may provide important information regarding the neuromuscular effects of bracing. Objective: To study the effects of 2 different ankle braces on the neuromuscular factors influencing ankle stiffness. Design: Mixed-model repeated-measures design. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-eight physically active participants composing 2 groups: 14 with unilateral functional ankle instability (age = 26.19 ñ 6.46 years, height = 166.07 ñ 12.90 cm, mass = 69.90 ñ 13.46 kg) and 14 with bilaterally stable ankles (age = 23.76 ñ 5.82 years, height = 174.00 ñ 11.67 cm, mass = 68.60 ñ 13.12 kg). Intervention(s): Participants were fitted with surface electromyography electrodes over the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles. Each participant received transient motion oscillations to his or her ankle on a custom-built medial-lateral swaying cradle in each of 3 conditions: no ankle brace (NB), lace-up brace (LU), and semirigid brace (SR). Main Outcome Measure(s): Ankle stiffness as measured by the cradle and preactivation levels (percentage of maximal voluntary isometric contraction) of the 4 test muscles. Results: Stiffness levels increased across brace conditions (NB = 24.79 ñ 6.59 Nm/rad, LU = 28.29 ñ 7.05 Nm/rad, SR = 33.22 ñ 8.78 Nm/rad; F<inf>2,52</inf> = 66.185, P < .001). No differences were found between groups for rotational stiffness (stable = 27.36 ñ 6.17 Nm/rad, unstable = 30.18 ñ 8.21 Nm/rad; F<inf>1,26</inf> = 1.084, P = .307). Preactivation levels did not change for any of the tested muscles with the application of an ankle brace (F<inf>2,52</inf> = 1.326, P = .275). Conclusions: The increase in ankle rotational stiffness with the addition of an ankle brace and the lack of any demonstrable neuromuscular changes suggested ankle braces passively contributed to the stability of the system. ? by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.",Scopus,10.4085/1062-6050-44.4.363,Journal of Athletic Training
1614,SC-997,Kerimo?lu et al. (2009),2009,Magnetic resonance imagination of the peroneus longus tendon after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Several studies report that tendons can regenerate after harvesting. These studies have been performed especially in patellar and hamstring tendons. At our institution, 10 cm length of full thickness peroneus longus tendon has been harvested to reconstruct torn anterior cruciate ligament since 1997 as a different graft source. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the peroneus longus tendon used the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has a regeneration potential or not. Twelve patients, who had originally undergone harvesting of the peroneus longus tendon for the primary surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Images of both legs were acquired simultaneously with the use of the scanner's extremity coil, as we aimed to compare harvested peroneus longus tendon with the other leg's peroneus longus tendon (healthy side) for evaluation of the regeneration potential. The average age of the patients was 31 years. There were eight right and four left legs. The average time interval was 52 months between ligament surgery and MRI. In all patients, a varying amount of the regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon was seen on the MRI images. Although the extent of PLT regeneration in proximal sections seemed better than in mid- and distal sections, there was no statistical difference between sections (P = 0.130). These data show that the peroneus longus tendon has a regeneration potential after harvesting for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. ? 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-008-0626-7,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"
1615,SC-998,Kloc et al. (2009),2009,Biomechanical comparison of two alternative tibial plateau leveling osteotomy plates with the original standard in an axially loaded gap model: An in vitro study,"Objective - To compare the axial compression stiffness of osteotomized canine tibiae stabilized with Slocum, Securos, or Synthes plates after a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) procedure. Study Design - In vitro, paired comparison of cadaveric tibial constructs subjected to mechanical testing under an axial load. Sample Population Canine tibiae (n=16 pairs) from skeletally mature male and female dogs of various breeds (18-55 kg). Methods - Tibial pairs (n=16) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study cohorts (n=8 pairs/cohort): cohort 1, tibial osteotomy stabilization with a Slocum or a Securos plate, or cohort 2, tibial osteotomy stabilization with a Slocum or a Synthes plate. One tibia from each pair was stabilized with 1 of each plate design assigned to the cohort after TPLO. A 3.2 mm osteotomy gap was maintained during plate application in all constructs. Load and axial displacement were recorded while constructs were loaded to 2000 N in axial compression. Failure loads were not reported because no distinct yield point or failure point was evident within the load range for many specimens. Failure modes were recorded for each construct, and photographs of typical failures were obtained. Stiffness (N/mm) was calculated from load-displacement curves. Paired comparisons of mean stiffness were performed within study groups using a paired t-test. Significance was set at P<.05. Results - The mean construct stiffnesses for the Slocum (383ñ183 N/mm) and Securos (258ñ64.1 N/mm) constructs were not significantly different (P=.164; power=0.566). The mean construct stiffness for the Synthes constructs (486ñ91.0 N/mm) was significantly greater than that of the Slocum constructs (400ñ117 N/mm); P=.0468. Modes of failure for the Slocum (16/16) and Securos (8/8) constructs included plastic deformation of the implant with valgus deformity combined with fibular luxation (2/16 Slocum; 1/8 Securos) or fibular fracture (2/16 Slocum; 4/8 Securos). Most Synthes constructs underwent elastic deformation (7/8). One Synthes construct fractured in the saggital plane through the tibial plateau depression at the point of load application. Conclusions - The Slocum and Securos plate/tibia construct have similar stiffness, whereas the Synthes/tibia constructs are significantly stiffer than the Slocum/tibia constructs. Modes of fixation failure observed in this model were consistent with TPLO fixation failures observed clinically. Clinical Relevance - Construct stiffness in axial load varies with implant type. Implants that confer higher stiffness to the construct may result in greater fixation stability in tibial metaphyseal osteotomies. ?

1616,SC-999,Chen et al. (2009),2009,A Novel Method for Measuring Electromechanical Delay of the Vastus Medialis Obliquus and Vastus Lateralis,"Electromechanical delay (EMD) of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) and vastus lateralis (VL) is determined by measuring the interval between the time of onset of muscle activities and the time of onset of mechanical output. However, individual mechanical output of the VMO or the VL cannot be obtained with the conventional method because of the knee extension force as the mechanical output. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to develop a new method for measuring EMD of the VMO and VL individually. Twelve healthy volunteers participated in the experiment. The motor point of the target muscle was electrically stimulated to evoke a muscle twitch. Simultaneously, the electrical stimulation signal was transmitted to ultrasound apparatus via the electrocardiography input channel. The ultrasound apparatus was used to capture the patellar movement elicited by the muscle twitch. EMD was measured from the onset of the electrical stimulation to the onset of patellar movement. The results showed that the intraclass correlation coefficients for the reproducibility of the EMD measurements of the VMO and VL were greater than 0.8. The EMDs of the VMO and VL were 18.3 ñ 2.2 ms and 24.8 ñ 5.8 ms, respectively. This new method provides a more precise measurement of EMD in the VMO and VL than does the conventional method because of the use of patellar movement as the mechanical output.

,,Papadopoulos et al. (2008),2008,"The effect of different skin-ankle brace application pressures with and without shoes on single-limb balance, electromyographic activation onset and peroneal reaction time of lower limb muscles","Background: Several studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effect of ankle bracing on ankle joint function and performance. However, no study so far has examined the role of skin-brace interface pressure in neuromuscular control. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different skin-ankle brace interface pressures, with and without shoes, on quiet single-limb balance and the electromyographic (EMG) activation sequence of four lower limb muscles. Methods: Twelve male physical education students who volunteered to take part in the study were measured with and without shoes under three ankle brace conditions: (i) without brace, (ii) with brace and 30 kilopascals (kPa) application pressure and (iii) with brace and 60 kPa application pressure. Single-limb balance (anteroposterior and mediolateral parameter) was assessed on the dominant lower limb, with open and closed eyes, on a force platform, simultaneously with the EMG recording of four lower lower limb muscles' (gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, rectus femoris and biceps femoris) activation onset. Peroneus longus reaction time was also measured by provoking a sudden subtalar inversion stress test using a trap-door. Results: The results showed that the application of athletic footwear resulted in a significant difference between the condition with shoes and without shoes, with a significantly increased anteroposterior sway and sway velocity, in all three ankle brace application conditions with shoes (F = 50.9, d.f. = 1, p < 0.001 and F = 58.4, d.f. = 1, p < 0.001), but had no effect in the mediolateral stability, or the total stability parameter. Shoes had no significant effect on the EMG activation sequence of the four lower limb muscles. Lastly, ankle brace application with 30 and 60 kPa application pressures, with and without athletic footwear, led to a significant delay in the peroneus longus reaction time (F = 9.71, d.f. = 2, p < 0.001). Conclusions: These findings suggest that different ankle brace application pressures may have an effect on single-limb balance, and peroneal reaction time. The application of athletic footwear, further adversely affects these parameters significantly. Further research is needed in this area with more dynamic and functional measurements, before the safe use of ankle bracing can be widely recommended. ? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

(2008),2008,Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the peroneus longus tendon,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft. Methods: The study included 29 patients (27 males, 2 females; mean age 30 years; range 21 to 39 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft and interference nail fixation. Fourteen patients (48.3%) also had partial meniscectomy during surgery. The results were assessed according to the Lysholm scores and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale at the end of at least five years of follow-up. Results: According to the IKDC scale, 17 patients (58.6%) were rated as normal or nearly normal, and 12 patients (41.4%) were rated as abnormal or severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm score was 83.7 (range 45 to 100), with excellent or good results in 23 patients (79.3%). Radiographic examination showed mild (n=10) or moderate (n=1) degenerative changes in the knee joint. Compared with the normal side, no flexion or extension losses occurred in the affected knees. Stability of the ACL was assessed by the Lachman test, which showed normal findings in 12 patients (41.4%), while nine patients had 1+, five patients had 2+, and three patients had 3+ anteroposterior laxity. Pivot-shift test was negative in 13 patients (44.8%); ten patients had 1+ pivot glide, and six patients had 2+ pivot shift. Two patients (6.9%) complained of mild to moderate pressure pain, paresthesia and dysesthesia at the donor site of PLT. No patient experienced ankle joint dysfunction or difficulty in sports activities due to PLT graft transfer. Conclusion: Our data show that PLT can be an appropriate autograft source for ACL reconstruction, avoiding potential complications of autografts obtained from the knee region. ?2008 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.",Scopus,10.3944/AOTT.2008.42.1.038,Acta Orthopaedica et Traumatologica Turcica

Achilles tendon fibroblasts from 2-month-old New Zealand white rabbits were cultured to confluence, after which the cells were transfected by an adenovirus carrying either the ?-galactosidase reporter gene or the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 50, 100, or 500. Two days later, the cells were transplanted onto the surfaces of rabbit Achilles, peroneus brevis, flexor profundus, and extensor longus tendons. The tendons were assessed by X-gal staining after 9 days, and by GFP fluorescence at 7, 14, and 21 days. Twenty percent to 50% of the treated cells stained for ?-galactosidase at an MOI of 500. The GFP-labeled cells showed nearly 100% fluorescence at an MOI of 50. No positive cells were visible in the control group. The ?-galactosidase and GFP-expressing cells remained viable for as long as 3 weeks.

,,Birznieks et al. (2008),2008,The effects of experimental muscle and skin pain on the static stretch sensitivity of human muscle spindles in relaxed leg muscles,"Animal studies have shown that noxious inputs onto ?-motoneurons can cause an increase in the activity of muscle spindles, and it has been proposed that this causes a fusimotor-driven increase in muscle stiffness that is believed to underlie many chronic pain syndromes. To test whether experimental pain also acts on the fusimotor system in humans, unitary recordings were made from 19 spindle afferents (12 Ia, 7 II) located in the ankle and toe extensors or peronei muscles of awake human subjects. Muscle pain was induced by bolus intramuscular injection of 0.5 ml 5% hypertonic saline into tibialis anterior (TA); skin pain was induced by 0.2 ml injection into the overlying skin. Changes in fusimotor drive to the muscle spindles were inferred from changes in the mean discharge frequency and discharge variability of spindle endings in relaxed muscle. During muscle pain no afferents increased their discharge activity: seven afferents (5 Ia, 2 II) showed a decrease and six (4 Ia, 2 II) afferents were not affected. During skin pain of 13 afferents discharge rate increased in one (Ia) and decreased in two (1 Ia, 1 II). On average, the overall discharge rate decreased during muscle pain by 6.1% (P < 0.05; Wilcoxon), but remained essentially the same during skin pain. There was no detectable correlation between subjective pain level and the small change in discharge rate of muscle spindles. Irrespective of the type of pain, discharge variability parameters were not influenced (P > 0.05; Wilcoxon). We conclude that, contrary to the 'vicious cycle' hypothesis, acute activation of muscle or skin nociceptors does not cause a reflex increase in fusimotor drive in humans. Rather, our results are more aligned with the pain adaptation model, based on clinical studies predicting pain-induced reductions of agonist muscle activity. ? 2008 The Authors.

,,Barei et al. (2008),2008,Frequency and fracture morphology of the posteromedial fragment in bicondylar tibial plateau fracture patterns,"OBJECTIVES: Bicondylar tibial plateau fracture management remains therapeutically challenging, partly because of multiplanar articular comminution. This study was performed to evaluate the frequency and morphologic characteristics of the posteromedial fragment in this injury pattern. DESIGN: Retrospective chart and radiographic review. SETTING: Urban Level 1 university trauma center. PATIENTS: Fifty-seven patients sustaining 57 Orthopedic Trauma Association (OTA) C-Type bicondylar tibial plateau fractures formed the study group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Between May 2000 and March 2003, 170 OTA C-Type bicondylar tibial plateau fractures were identified using an orthopaedic database. One hundred and forty-six fractures had computed tomographic (CT) scans performed prior to definitive fixation and were reviewed using the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Sixty-six (45.2%) injuries had fractures that involved the medial articular surface. Nine with suboptimal CTs were excluded, leaving 57 injuries for review. Forty-two patients demonstrated coronal plane posteromedial fragments. Morphologic evaluation of the posteromedial fragment included articular surface area, maximum posterior cortical height (PCH), and sagittal fracture angle (SFA). RESULTS: Forty-two of 57 injuries (74%) demonstrated a posteromedial fragment that comprised a mean of 58% of the articular surface of the medial tibial plateau (range, 19%-98%) and a mean of 23% of the entire tibial plateau articular surface (range, 8%-47%). Mean posteromedial fragment height was 42 mm (range, 16-59 mm), and mean sagittal fracture angle was 81 degrees (range, 33 degrees to 112 degrees). Six patients demonstrated fracture patterns not accurately identified by the AO/OTA (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fr Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association) fracture classification system. CONCLUSIONS: A posteromedial fragment was observed in nearly one third of the bicondylar plateau fractures evaluated. The morphologic features of this fragment may have clinical implications when using currently available laterally applied fixed-angle screw/plate implants to stabilize these injuries. Alternate or supplementary fixation methods may be required when managing this injury pattern. ? 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Scopus,10.1097/BOT.0b013e318169ef08,Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma

Between January 2000 and November 2004, nine patients with an early neglected Achilles tendon rupture (ò 4 and ó 12 weeks from injury), underwent surgical reconstruction. Eight patients were male and one female, their age was average 41 years and the median follow-up period was 3.66 years. The average clinical defect of the Achilles tendon was 4.33 cm. All patients were examined by the clinical ankle scoring system of Leppilahti et al. (Clin Orthop 346:152-161, 1998). Six patients presented excellent results and three patients had good results. All patients had equal plantarflexion and dorsiflexion with the healthy side and all of the study's patients returned to work 3 months postoperatively. An average muscle atrophy of 0.83 cm was documented compared with the uninjured side. Only four of nine patients (44.44%) had a normal one-legged jump. There were no complications postoperatively and no re-ruptures of the Achilles tendons. This combined method appears to be safe and effective, with a low risk for complications, allowing us to obtain excellent results for the majority of our patients. ? 2007 Urban & Vogel Mnchen.",Scopus,10.1007/s00068-007-7038-0,European Journal of Trauma and Emergency Surgery

,,Gorgey et al. (2008),2008,The role of pulse duration and stimulation duration in maximizing the normalized torque during neuromuscular electrical stimulation,"fisheye STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. fisheye OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of pulse duration and stimulation duration on the evoked torque after controlling for the activated area by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). fisheye BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is commonly used in the clinic without considering the physiological implications of its parameters. fisheye METHODS AND MEASURES: Seven able-bodied, college students (mean ñ SD age, 28 ñ 4 years) participated in this study. Two NMES protocols were applied to the knee extensor muscle group in a random order. Protocol A applied 100-Hz, 450-microsecond pulses for 5 minutes in a 3-seconds-on 3-seconds-off duty cycle. Protocol B applied 60-Hz, 250-microsecond pulses for 5 minutes in a 10-seconds-on 20-seconds-off duty cycle. The amplitude of the current was similar in both protocols. Torque, torque time integral, and normalized torque for the knee extensors were measured for both protocols. MRI scans were taken prior to, and immediately after, each protocol to measure the cross-sectional area of the stimulated muscle. fisheye RESULTS: The skeletal muscle cross-sectional areas activated after both protocols were similar. The longer pulse duration in protocol A elicited 22% greater torque output than that of protocol B (P<.05). After considering the activated area in both protocols, the normalized torque with protocol A was 38% greater than that with protocol B (P<.05). Torque time integral was 21% greater with protocol A (P = .029). Protocol B failed to maintain torque at the start and the end of the 10-second activation. fisheye CONCLUSIONS: Longer pulse duration, but not stimulation duration, resulted in a greater evoked and normalized torque compared to the shorter pulse duration, even after controlling for the activated muscular CSA with both protocols. fisheye LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapy, level 5.",Scopus,10.2519/jospt.2008.2734,Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy
,,Shaw et al. (2008),2008,"Ankle bracing, fatigue, and time to stabilization in collegiate volleyball athletes","Context: Fatigue has been shown to disrupt dynamic stability in healthy volunteers. It is not known if wearing prophylactic ankle supports can improve dynamic stability in fatigued athletes. Objective: To determine the type of ankle brace that may be more effective at providing dynamic stability after a jump-landing task during normal and fatigued conditions. Design: Two separate repeated-measures analyses of variance with 2 within-subjects factors (condition and time) were performed for each dependent variable. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Ten healthy female collegiate volleyball athletes participated (age = 19.5 ñ 1.27 years, height = 179.07 ñ 7.6 cm, mass = 69.86 ñ 5.42 kg). Intervention(s): Athletes participated in 3 separate testing sessions, applying a different bracing condition at each session: no brace (NB), Swede-O Universal lace-up ankle brace (AB), and Active Ankle brace (AA). Three trials of a jump-landing task were performed under each condition before and after induced functional fatigue. The jump-landing task consisted of a single-leg landing onto a force plate from a height equivalent to 50% of each participant's maximal jump height and from a starting position 70 cm from the center of the force plate. Main Outcome Measure(s): Time to stabilization in the anterior-posterior (APTTS) and medial-lateral (MLTTS) directions. Results: For APTTS, a condition-by-time interaction existed (F<inf>2,18</inf> = 5.55, P = .013). For the AA condition, Tukey post hoc testing revealed faster pretest (2.734 ñ 0.331 seconds) APTTS than posttest (3.817 ñ 0.263 seconds). Post hoc testing also revealed that the AB condition provided faster APTTS (2.492 ñ 0.271 seconds) than AA (3.817 ñ 0.263 seconds) and NB (3.341 ñ 0.339 seconds) conditions during posttesting. No statistically significant findings were associated with MLTTS. Conclusions: Fatigue increased APTTS for the AA condition. Because the AB condition was more effective than the other 2 conditions during the posttesting, the AB appears to be the best option for providing dynamic stability in the anteriorposterior direction during a landing task. ? by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.",Scopus,10.4085/1062-6050-43.2.164,Journal of Athletic Training
,,Delahunt et al. (2007),2007,Ankle function during hopping in subjects with functional instability of the ankle joint,"A common mechanism of inversion injury involves a lateral movement producing a hypersupination of the ankle joint. To date, no study has investigated patterns of muscle activity, three-dimensional (3D) joint kinematics and kinetics simultaneously in a group of subjects with functional instability (FI) compared with a non-injured control group during a lateral hopping test. Twenty-six subjects with the subjective complaint of FI of the ankle joint and 24 non-injured healthy control subjects volunteered to participate in the study. We measured 3D lower limb kinematics, kinetics and surface electromyography (EMG) of the rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and soleus muscle in all subjects during a lateral hop task for the period 200 ms pre- and post-initial contact (IC). FI subjects were observed to have a less-everted position of the ankle joint during the time period from 45 ms pre-IC to 95 ms post-IC (P<0.05). FI subjects were also found to have an increase in pre- and post-IC rectus femoris, tibialis anterior and solues EMG activity. The results suggest that subjects with FI exhibit changes in ankle joint movement and neuromuscular control that could predispose to further injury. ? 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.",Scopus,10.1111/j.1600-0838.2006.00612.x,Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports
,,Yucesoy et al. (2007),2007,Substantial effects of epimuscular myofascial force transmission on muscular mechanics have major implications on spastic muscle and remedial surgery,"The specific aim of this paper is to review the effects of epimuscular myofascial force transmission on muscular mechanics and present some new results on finite element modeling of non-isolated aponeurotomized muscle in order to discuss the dependency of mechanics of spastic muscle, as well as surgery for restoration of function on such force transmission. The etiology of the effects of spasticity on muscular mechanics is not fully understood. Clinically, such effects feature typically a limited joint range of motion, which at the muscle level must originate from altered muscle length-force characteristics, in particular a limited muscle length range of force exertion. In studies performed to understand what is different in spastic muscle and what the effects of remedial surgery are, muscle is considered as being independent of its surroundings. Conceivably, this is because the classical approach in muscle mechanics is built on experimenting with dissected muscles. Certainly, such approach allowed improving our understanding of fundamental muscle physiology yet it yielded implicitly a narrow point of view of considering muscle length-force characteristics as a fixed property of the muscle itself. However, within its context of its intact connective tissue surroundings (the in vivo condition) muscle is not an isolated and independent entity. Instead, collagenous linkages between epimysia of adjacent muscles provide direct intermuscular connections, and structures such as the neurovascular tracts provide indirect intermuscular connections. Moreover, compartmental boundaries (e.g., intermuscular septa, interosseal membranes, periost and compartmental fascia) are continuous with neurovascular tracts and connect muscular and non-muscular tissues at several locations additional to the tendon origins and insertions. Epimuscular myofascial force transmission occurring via this integral system of connections has major effects on muscular mechanics including substantial proximo-distal force differences, sizable changes in the determinants of muscle length-force characteristics (e.g. a condition dependent shift in muscle optimum length to a different length or variable muscle optimal force) explained by major serial and parallel distributions of sarcomere lengths. Therefore, due to epimuscular myofascial force transmission, muscle length-force characteristics are variable and muscle length range of force exertion cannot be considered as a fixed property of the muscle. The findings reviewed presently show that acutely, the mechanical mechanisms manipulated in remedial surgery are dominated by epimuscular myofascial force transmission. Conceivably, this is also true for the mechanism of adaptation during and after recovery from surgery. Moreover, stiffened epimuscular connections and therefore a stiffened integral system of intra- and epimuscular myofascial force transmission are indicated to affect the properties of spastic muscle. We suggest that important advancements in our present understanding of such properties, variability in the outcome of surgery and considerable recurrence of the impeded function after recovery cannot be made without taking into account the effects of epimuscular myofascial force transmission. ? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,,BussiŠres et al. (2007),2007,Diagnostic Imaging Practice Guidelines for Musculoskeletal Complaints in Adults-An Evidence-Based Approach. Part 1: Lower Extremity Disorders,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop evidence-based diagnostic imaging practice guidelines to assist chiropractors and other primary care providers in decision making for the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging of lower extremity disorders. Methods: A comprehensive search of the English and French language literature was conducted using a combination of subject headings and keywords. The quality of the citations was assessed using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS), the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE), and the Stroke Prevention and Educational Awareness Diffusion (SPREAD) evaluation tools. The Referral Guidelines for Imaging (Radiation Protection 118) coordinated by the European Commission served as the initial template. The first draft was sent for external review. A Delphi panel composed of international experts on the topic of musculoskeletal disorders in chiropractic radiology, clinical sciences, and research were invited to review and propose recommendations on the indications for diagnostic imaging. The guidelines were pilot tested and peer reviewed by field chiropractors, and by chiropractic and medical specialists. Recommendations were graded according to the strength of the evidence. Results: Recommendations for diagnostic imaging guidelines of adult lower extremity disorders are provided, supported by more than 174 primary and secondary citations. Except for trauma, the overall quality of available literature is low. On average, 57 Delphi panelists completed 1 of 2 rounds, reaching more than 83% agreement on all 56 recommendations. Peer review by specialists reflected high levels of agreement, perceived ease of use of guidelines, and implementation feasibility. Conclusions: The guidelines are intended to be used in conjunction with sound clinical judgment and experience and should be updated regularly. Dissemination and implementation strategies are discussed. Future research is needed to validate their content. ? 2007 National University of Health Sciences.",Scopus,10.1016/j.jmpt.2007.10.004,Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics

Design: Experimental, pretest-posttest. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Ten female and 9 male college-aged subjects. Intervention: Fatigue was induced via continuous concentric and eccentric muscle actions of the ankle: inversion (INV), eversion (EV), plantar flexion (PF), and dorsiflexion (DF). Main Outcome Measures: Peak torque (PT), peak EMG, and median frequency (MF) were calculated prefatigue and postfatigue in the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PER), and lateral gastrocnemius (GAS) muscles. Results: Main effects were noted for test (P < 0.0125) in all statistical tests performed indicating changes in PT, peak EMG, and MF after fatigue. Conclusions: A significant decrease in MF of the PER muscle after PF fatigue and corresponding with a decreased firing rate, may be of importance, especially with regard to the role in countering the violent moment seen with inversion ankle sprains. ? 2007 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Scopus,10.1123/jsr.16.4.295,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation

Before interpreting test results of latency times in patients with chronic ankle instability and healthy subjects, the reliability of these measures must be first demonstrated. Objective: To investigate the test-retest reliability of variables measured during a sudden ankle inversion movement in standing subjects with healthy ankle joints. Design: Validation study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: 15 subjects with healthy ankle joints (30 ankles). Intervention(s): Subjects stood on an ankle inversion platform with both feet tightly fixed to independently moveable trapdoors. An unexpected sudden ankle inversion of 50ø was imposed. Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured latency and motor response times and electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle, along with the time and angular position of the first and second decelerating moments, the mean and maximum inversion speed, and the total inversion time. Correlation coefficients and standard error of measurements were calculated. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.17 for the electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle (standard error of measurement = 2.7 milliseconds) to 0.89 for the maximum inversion speed (standard error of measurement = 34.8 milliseconds). Conclusions: The reliability of the latency and motor response times of the peroneus longus muscle, the time of the first and second decelerating moments, and the mean and maximum inversion speed was acceptable in subjects with healthy ankle joints and supports the investigation of the reliability of these measures in subjects with chronic ankle instability. The lower reliability of the electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle and the angular positions of both decelerating moments calls the use of these variables into question. ? by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.",Scopus,0,Journal of Athletic Training

(2006),2006,Immunological rejection and biomechnical adaptability following xenogenic tendon defect repaired with rolled porcine small intestinal submucosa,"Background: Re-injury of organism and sufficient of materials exist in the autologous transplantation of tendon to treat defected tendon following trauma. Carbon fiber artifical tendon, human hair tendon and other artifical tendons are also proved to be transplantable. But immunological rejection and biomechanical inadaptability exist following artifical tendons are transplanted. Therefore, the development of new human tendon substitute is the major problem to be solved at present. Objective: To observe the porcine small intestinal submucosa as artificial tendon to repair 2 cm tendon defect of the 3rd toe of the left and right feet of chicken, and the immunological rejection and biomechanical adaptability following repair. Design: A randomized and controlled animal experiment. Setting: Department of Orthopaedics, Sixth Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University. Materials: Totally 45 Leghorn chickens, aged 12 weeks, of either gender, with body mass of 4.0 to 4.4 kg, were chosen. Methods: This experiment was conducted at the Department of Orthopaedics, Sixth Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University from September 2002 to June 2003. (1) Totally 45 Leghorn chicken, aged 12 weeks, were randomly divided into 3 groups. The third toe of the left and right feet was chosen from 20 chicken respectively of autologous transplantation group and porcine small intestinal submucosa group, flexor digitorum profundus muscle tendon was cut off at middle phalanx, and 2 cm tendon defect model was created. The defected tendon in the autologous transplantation group was performed in situ suture; the defected tendon in the porcine small intestinal submucosa transplantation group was repaired with porcine small intestinal submucosa; There was not any treatment on the 5 Leghorn chicken in the blank control group. (2) Histomorphologyl, transplantation immunology, biomechanics and functional recovery were measured at 3,6 and 9 weeks following tendon transplantation. Main Outcome Measures: (1) Gross observation of operated toes of chicken and optical observation of grafts in each group. (2) White blood cell (WBC) differential count at 3 days preoperation, 3 days postoperation, and 1 week and 2 weeks postoperation. (3) Biomechanical test and functional recovery test of chicken in each group. Results: Totally 45 chicken entered the stage of result analysis. (1) At 9 weeks after operation, morphology of porcine small intestinal submucosa was basically the same as that of normal tendon by naked eyes; Under optical microscope, fibroblasts on the porcine small intestinal submucosa arranged in order along long-axis and collagen extracellular matrix appeared. (2) Within 2 weeks after operation, there was no significant difference of WBC measurement between porcine small intestinal submucosa transplantation group and autogolous transplantation group (P > 0.05), suggesting that porcine small intestinal submucosa, as xenogenic material, has no obvious immunological rejection. (3) In the biomechanical test, biomechanical adaptability at postoperative 12 weeks was superior in the porcine small intestinal submucosa group to in the autologous transplantation group [(22.22ñ0.90), (20.78ñ0.94), P<0.05]. (4) In the test of functional recovery, there was no obvious difference of activity of metecarpophalangeal joint (P > 0.05), the activity of proximal interphalangeal joint was superior in the blank control group to in the porcine small intestinal submucosa group and autologous transplantation group [(21.0ñ1.6)ø, (15.1ñ1.7)ø,(16.0ñ2.1)ø, P < 0.05].

,,Delahunt et al. (2006),2006,Altered neuromuscular control and ankle joint kinematics during walking in subjects with functional instability of the ankle joint,"Background: The ankle joint requires very precise neuromuscular control during the transition from terminal swing to the early stance phase of the gait cycle. Altered ankle joint arthrokinematics and muscular activity have been cited as potential factors that may lead to an inversion sprain during the aforementioned time periods. However, to date, no study has investigated patterns of muscle activity and 3D joint kinematics simultaneously in a group of subjects with functional instability compared with a noninjured control group during these phases of the gait cycle. Purpose: To compare the patterns of lower limb 3D joint kinematics and electromyographic activity during treadmill walking in a group of subjects with functional instability with those observed in a control group. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Three-dimensional angular velocities and displacements of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, as well as surface electromyography of the rectus femoris, peroneus longus, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles, were recorded simultaneously while subjects walked on a treadmill at a velocity of 4 km/h. Results: Before heel strike, subjects with functional instability exhibited a decrease in vertical foot-floor clearance (12.62 vs 22.84 mm; P < .05), as well as exhibiting a more inverted position of the ankle joint before, at, and immediately after heel strike (1.69ø, 2.10ø, and -0.09ø vs -1.43ø, -1.43ø, and -2.78ø, respectively [minus value = eversion]; P < .05) compared with controls. Subjects with functional instability were also observed to have an increase in peroneus longus integral electromyography during the post-heel strike time period (107.91%úmillisecond vs 64.53%úmillisecond; P < .01). Conclusion: The altered kinematics observed in this study could explain the reason subjects with functional instability experience repeated episodes of ankle inversion injury in situations with only slight or no external provocation. It is hypothesized that the observed increase in peroneus longus activity may be the result of a change in preprogrammed feed-forward motor control. ? 2006 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1177/0363546506290989,American Journal of Sports Medicine
,,Brunetti et al. (2006),2006,Improvement of posture stability by vibratory stimulation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) may reduce, but it does not always eliminate, knee and body instability because of a persisting proprioceptive deficit. In order to enhance body stability, a new protocol of treatment has been proposed consisting of mechanical vibration (100 Hz frequency and < 20 ?m amplitude) of the quadriceps muscle in the leg that has undergone ACL reconstruction. In our trials, stimulation was performed when the quadriceps muscle was kept isometrically contracted. Treatment was started one month after surgery. Vibration was applied for short periods over three consecutive days. Nine months after treatment, postural stability was re-evaluated with the subjects standing on one leg with open and with closed eyes. The postural stability of the subjects having undergone vibration treatment, standing on the operated leg was significantly improved one day after treatment when evaluated as mean of speed and elliptic area of the center of pressure. The improvement persisted and increased during the following weeks. Peak torques of the operated leg extensor muscles also increased and reached values close to that of the leg, which had not been operated. Conversely, the balance of the untreated subjects standing on the operated leg did not improve and the restoration of the extensor muscle peak torque was poor. It is concluded that short lasting proprioceptive activation by vibration may lead to a faster and more complete equilibrium recovery probably by permanently changing the network controlling knee posture. ? 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-006-0101-2,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"

,,Fattorini et al. (2006),2006,Motor performance changes induced by muscle vibration,"The possibility that mechanical stimulation of selected muscles can act directly on the nervous system inducing persistent changes of motor performances was explored. On the basis of literature, stimulating parameters were chosen to stimulate the central nervous system and to avoid muscle fibre injuries. A sinusoidal mechanical vibration was applied, for three consecutive days, on the quadriceps muscle in seven subjects that performed a muscular contraction (VC). The same stimulation paradigm was applied on seven subjects in relaxed muscle condition (VR) and seven subjects were not treated at all (NV). Two sessions (PRE and POST) of isometric and isotonic tests were performed separated for 21 days, in all studied groups 7 days before and 15 days after stimulation, whilst an isokinetic test was performed on VC only. In the isometric test, the time of force development showed a significant decrease only in VC (POST vs PRE mean 27.8%, P < 0.05). In the isotonic test, the subjects' had to perform a fatiguing leg extension against a load. In this condition, the fatigue resistance increased greatly in VC (mean 40.3%, P < 0.001), increased slightly in VR and there was no difference in NV. In Isokinetic test, at several angular velocities, significantly less time was required to reach the force peak (mean 20.2% P < 0.05). The findings could be ascribed to plastic changes in proprioceptive processing, leading to an improvement in knee joint control. Such action delineates a new tool in sports training and in motor rehabilitation. ? Springer-Verlag 2006.",Scopus,10.1007/s00421-006-0250-5,European Journal of Applied Physiology

,,Walther et al. (2006),2006,The bone marrow edema of the foot; Das Knochen”dem am Fuá,"Bone marrow edema (BME) of the foot and ankle is a common finding. Based on the causative factors, this condition can be classified into four different groups: mechanical, reactive, ischemic and metabolic BME. Mechanical BME: ""Bone bruises"", trabecular fractures, micro fractures and stress fractures. Ischemic BME: osteochondritis dissecans, osteonecrosis. Reactive BME: degenerative or inflammatory arthritis, tendonitis, tumorous lesions, postoperative conditions. Metabolic BME: Transient osteoporosis (syn. bone marrow edema syndrome). The understanding of the causative factors is mandatory to develop a strategy for treatment. Mechanical BME caused by overuse or acute trauma are the most frequent findings in sports. Subtle injuries of the trabecular bone are often not visible on MRI, but can become apparent on high resolution CT. Close cooperation with the radiologist is mandatory to make a precise diagnosis. Nonweight bearing in addition to analgesics and physiotherapy are the major principles in the treatment. However, if possible, local overload or a hind foot malalignment should be reduced by insoles. The off-label use of ilomedin or bisphosphonates can be helpful, although there is still a lack of scientific evidence. ?

,,Kocabey et al. (2006),2006,Reconstruction of neglected Achilles' tendon defect with peroneus brevis tendon allograft: A case report,"This case report describes the use of a peroneus brevis allograft to reconstruct a neglected Achilles' tendon injury in a 75-year-old woman. She had difficulty walking, had stiffness, and was unable to perform a heel raise from a single-leg standing position. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a 6.8-cm wide defect 13 months after the initial injury. Surgical repair of the neglected rupture was performed using 4 strands of peroneus brevis allograft to bridge the defect. Early weight bearing and rehabilitation was allowed. At follow-up clinical examination 14 months postoperation, the patient could perform 15 full-range standing heel raises on the involved side versus 22 on the noninvolved side. Maximum calf circumference was 30.7 cm in the operated leg versus 33 cm at the noninvolved side. At 24 months postoperation the patient could perform 16 full-range standing heel raises on the injured leg versus 24 on the normal leg (33% deficit). The maximum calf circumference improved to 31 cm on the injured side compared with 34 cm on the noninvolved side (9% deficit). The AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Clinical Rating System score improved from 55 just before operation to 96 at 14 months postoperatively. The score further improved to 100 at the 2-year follow-up examination. The patient was playing recreational doubles tennis 1 to 2 times per week without symptoms.

,,Bianchi et al. (2005),2005,Musculoskeletal sonography,"The use of musculoskeletal ultrasound continues to expand, mainly because of technical improvements (highfrequency broadband transducers, refined focusing, and sensitive color and power Doppler technology) and growing interest on the part of musculoskeletal radiologists. Its low cost, non-invasiveness and portability, which, for example, allows examination athletes to be examined directly on the sport field, are additional qualities appreciated by patients. In addition, up to-date, high-level equipment allow detection of normal anatomic details and identification of a variety of pathologic conditions [1]. The possibility to perform a dynamic examination is a specific advantage of US over magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). The main disadvantages of US are limited assessment capability of internal structures of the joints, bone and bone marrow. However, introduction of the extended-field-of-view technology has allowed imaging of larger segments and has made their interpretation by the referring physician easier. The objective of this article is to present the basic US aspect sof normal and pathologic muscles, tendons, and peripheral nerves followed by a review of the more commonly encountered abnormalities in different joints. ? 2005 Springer-Verlag Italia.",Scopus,10.1007/88-470-0339-3_23,0

,,Delgado-Alves et al. (2005),2005,"Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with enhanced oxidative stress, decreased plasma nitric oxide and paraoxonase activity in an experimental mouse model","Objective. Oxidative stress contributes to atherosclerosis, and evidence of enhanced oxidative stress exists in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In a non-lupus murine model, we evaluated whether anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies could affect the oxidant/antioxidant balance as an early biochemical step of APS. Methods. Hybridomas producing human and murine aCL and anti-?<inf>2</inf>-glycoprotein I (a?2-GPI) monoclonal antibodies were injected into three groups of five female BALB/c severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Corresponding hybridomas secreting non-antiphospholipid antibodies of the same isotype were employed as controls. Sera and organs were collected after 30 days. Paraoxonase (PON) activity, peroxynitrite, superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrotyrosine were measured in plasma. Expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results. PON activity and NO (sum of nitrate and nitrite) levels were reduced in the human aCL IgG group (P <0.002 and P<0.04, respectively), whilst peroxynitrite and superoxide and expression of total antioxidant capacity of plasma were increased (Plt;0.01). PON and NO were decreased in the murine a?2-GPI IgG and IgM aCL groups (P<0.03 and P<0.05, respectively). Nitrotyrosine was elevated in the human aCL IgG group (P<0.03). Western blotting showed reduced iNOS expression in the hearts of the IgG aCL group, confirmed by immunostaining. PON inversely correlated with IgG aCL titres (P<0.001), superoxide (P <0.008) and peroxynitrite levels (P<0.0009). Peroxynitrite and total IgG aCL were independent predictors of PON (P<0.0009 and P <0.02, respectively). Superoxide was the only independent predictor of NO (P<0.008) and of nitrotyrosine (P<0.002). Conclusion. aCL antibodies are associated with the decreased PON activity and reduced NO that may occur in the preclinical phase of APS. ? The Author 2005.

,,Bernhardt et al. (2005),2005,Influence of moderate prophylactic compression on sport performance,"This study examined the impact of using elasticized compression shorts on performance measures and proprioception at the hip. Thirteen healthy subjects completed 2 randomized testing sessions - one while wearing the Coreshorts compression shorts and one while not wearing the shorts. During each trial, active range of motion at the hip; joint angle replication during hip flexion, abduction, and hyperextension; leg power; agility; speed; and aerobic endurance were measured, and subjective information pertaining to the fit of the shorts was collected. The use of the prophylactic brace did not limit performance on any measure except active range of motion during hip flexion (p < 0.05). Subjective data revealed 93.3% of subjects felt the shorts were supportive, although proper fit was an issue. The present results support the use of moderate compression at and around the hip for the purpose of injury prevention. Continued research is necessary to determine the efficacy of hip bracing within an injured population and their potential prophylactic benefit for active individuals. ? 2005 National Strength & Conditioning Association.",Scopus,10.1519/1533-4287(2005)19[292:IOMPCO]2.0.CO;2,Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research
,,Maffulli et al. (2005),2005,Free gracilis tendon graft in neglected tears of the achilles tendon,"Objective: To report the results of a longitudinal study on reconstruction of neglected Achilles tendon rupture using a free autologous gracilis tendon graft. Design: Cohort study. Participants: Twenty-one patients underwent surgery for a neglected rupture of the Achilles tendon occurring between 65 days and 9 months before the operation. Methods: All participants were prospectively followed up for 2 years, and final review was performed at 28.4 ñ 3.5 months from the operation. Functional (anthropometric measurements, isometric strength, return to activities) and clinical assessment was performed. Results: No patients experienced any problems in the wound used to harvest the tendon of gracilis. Five patients were managed conservatively following a superficial infection of the Achilles tendon surgical wound. No patients developed a deep vein thrombosis or sustained a rerupture. All patients were able to walk on tiptoes, and no patient used a heel lift or walked with a visible limp. The maximum calf circumference remained significantly decreased in the operated leg at final review. The operated limb was significantly less strong than the nonoperated one. Conclusions: The management of neglected tears of the Achilles tendon by free gracilis tendon grafting is safe but technically demanding. It affords good recovery, even in patients with a neglected rupture of a duration of 9 months. These patients should be warned that they are at risk for postoperative complications, and that their ankle plantar flexion strength can remain reduced.

If cryotherapy affects dynamic stability, clinicians might alter their decisions regarding returning athletes to play immediately after treatment. Objective: To assess the effects of lower leg cold immersion on muscle activity and dynamic stability of the lower extremity. Design: Within-subject time-series design with 1 pretest and 2 posttests. Setting: A climate-controlled biomechanics laboratory. Participants: 17 healthy women. Interventions: 20-minute cold-water immersion. Main Outcome Measures: Preparatory and reactive electromyographic activity of the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus and time to stabilization after a jump landing. Results: Preparatory activity of the tibialis anterior increased after treatment, whereas preparatory and reactive peroneus longus activity decreased. Both returned to baseline after a 5-minute recovery. Time to stabilization did not change. Conclusions: Lower leg cold-immersion therapy does not impair dynamic stability in healthy women during a jump-landing task.

,,McLoda et al. (2005),2005,Effects of a task failure exercise on the peroneus longus and brevis during perturbed gait,"Ankle inversion injuries represent the most common trauma sustained by athletes. Muscle fatigue from activity may contribute to a delay in the response of the ankle proprioceptors and dynamic restraints during unexpected inversion. The purpose of this investigation was to determine changes in peroneal average EMG, peak EMG, and time to peak EMG following a task failure exercise. Thirty-two subjects (age 20 ñ 1.43 yrs; 21 male, 11 female) with no lower extremity injuries reported for data collection. Data were collected from each subject's dominant leg using surface electromyography (EMG). EMG electrodes were applied over the peroneus longus (PL) and brevis (PB) using a standard protocol. Subjects walked at a fixed pace on a 6.1 m runway with one section that could be unexpectedly dropped into 30ø of inversion upon foot contact. Trials with perturbed and unperturbed gait were randomized to reduce prediction of the unexpected inversion. Once 3 trials of perturbed gait were recorded, subjects completed an isotonic activity that isolated the peroneals. The task was completed to failure. Immediately following the task failure exercise, subjects walked on the perturbation runway once again until 3 trials of perturbed gait were recorded. Analysis revealed no significant differences with regard to average muscle activity between pre- and post-task failure exercise for the PL (F<inf>1,31</inf> = 0.133; p = 0.718) or for the PB (F<inf>1,31</inf> = 0.795; p = 0.380). There was also no significant difference in peak muscle activity pre- to post-task failure for the PL (F<inf>1,31</inf> = 0.032; p = 0.859) or the PB (F<inf>1,31</inf> = 0.156; p = 0.695). Finally, there was no significant difference in time-to-peak muscle activity pre- to post-task failure for the PL (F<inf>1,31</inf> =0.830; p = 0.369) or the PB (F<inf>1,31</inf> = 1.037; p = 0.316). We concluded that the task failure exercise did not contribute to changes in peroneal activity during perturbed gait. These results indicate that peroneal fatigue does not play a significant role in the incidence of inversion ankle sprains.",Scopus,0,Electromyography and Clinical Neurophysiology

,,Mayr et al. (2004),2004,Arthrofibrosis following ACL reconstruction - Reasons and outcome,"Introduction: Arthrofibrosis is a complication that severely influences the clinical outcome after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This retrospective clinical study analyses risk factors and outcome after arthrolysis in a large population. Material and methods: Two hundred twenty-three patients who had undergone arthrolysis after ACL reconstruction were examined. Range of motion (ROM) was reduced due to arthrofibrosis of the joint in 70% (n=156). Other reasons, such as cyclops syndrome or osteoarthritis were found in 30% (n=67). The mean time interval between arthrolysis and follow-up was 4.29 years. We recorded timing of surgery, additional injuries, state of the knee before reconstruction, range of motion, pain during rehabilitation, beginning, duration and type of rehabilitation, severity and etiology of joint stiffness and the time between ACL reconstruction and revision. The present state of the knee was documented using the IKDC form. Results: A significant correla tion of arthrofibrosis and preoperative irritation (plt;0.001), preoperative limited ROM (p=0.001), perioperative pain (p=0.046) and early beginning of muscle training (p=0.064) was found. Combination of a remaining loss of extension and development of degenerative joint disease was also significant (p=0.001). The decrease of sports activity compared with the level before ACL injury was highly significant (plt;0,001). The criteria to minimize the risk of arthrofibrosis and the optimal timing of arthrolysis are pointed out. ?

However, such problems actually occur more frequently in the antigravity muscles of the lower extremities, such as the triceps surae muscle. An analysis of microneurographically recorded Ia discharges from the tibial nerve innervating the triceps surae muscle during dynamic movement of the ankle joint indicated that they mainly transmitted information on the angular velocity of the joint. However, the information on the position sense of the joint was not as well transmitted through Ia discharges. There was no correlation between the joint angle and the static response. However, the dynamic response of a Ia afferent was well correlated to the angular velocity. It is concluded that the human proprioception of the triceps surae muscle was not dependent on the position of the ankle joint, but largely on its movement by the stretching of the muscle.",Scopus,10.2170/jjphysiol.54.385,Japanese Journal of Physiology

,,Palmieri-Smith et al. (2004),2004,Arthrogenic muscle response to a simulated ankle joint effusion,"Background: Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) is a continuing reflex reaction of the musculature surrounding a joint after distension or damage to the structures of that joint. This phenomenon has been well documented after knee joint injury and has been generalised to occur at other joints of the human body, yet minimal research has been conducted in this regard. The response of the muscles crossing the ankle/foot complex after ankle injury and effusion is not well understood. AMI may occur after an ankle sprain contributing to residual dysfunction. Objective: To determine if AMI is present in the soleus, peroneus longus, and tibialis anterior musculature after a simulated ankle joint effusion. Methods: Eight neurologically sound volunteers (mean (SD) age 23 (4) years, height 171 (6) cm, mass 73 (10) kg) participated. Maximum H-reflex and maximum M-wave measurements were collected using surface electromyography after delivery of a percutaneous stimulus to the sciatic nerve before its bifurcation into the common peroneal and posterior tibial nerves. Results: The H-reflex and M-wave measurements in all muscles increased (p ó 0.05) after the simulated ankle joint effusion. Conclusions: Simulated ankle joint effusion results in facilitation of the soleus, peroneus longus, and tibialis anterior motoneurone pools.

Static first ray mobility of 15 subjects was measured by a load cell device and ranged from stiff (3.1 mm) to lax (8.0 mm). Using three-dimensional motion analysis, mean first ray dorsiflexion/eversion and mid-/hindfoot eversion peak motion, time-to-peak, and eversion excursion were evaluated. Subjects with greater static dorsal mobility of the first ray demonstrated significantly greater time-to-peak hindfoot eversion and eversion excursion (p < .01), and midfoot peak eversion and eversion excursion (p < .01). No significant association was found between static first ray mobility and first ray motion during gait. This research provides evidence that the dynamic response of the foot may modulate the consequences of first ray mobility and that compensory strategies are most effective when static measures of dorsal mobility are most extreme.",Scopus,10.1177/107110070402500605,Foot and Ankle International

,,Hopkins et al. (2004),2004,Effects of Ankle Joint Effusion on Lower Leg Function,"Background: Inversion ankle sprains are among the most frequently encountered injuries in and outside of sport. Altered feedback from joint damage and/or edema may negatively affect dynamic stabilization, thereby increasing the patients' susceptibility to further injury. In order to understand better how the sensorimotor system responds to the presence of ankle edema during a functional task, further examination is warranted. Objective: To quantify muscle activation in the peroneal, tibialis anterior, and soleus musculature as well as to determine ankle joint peak torque, peak power, and root mean square (RMS) power during a closed kinetic chain activity following artificial ankle effusion. Design: Dependent variables were compared within subjects across time intervals and between groups. Setting: All data were collected in the biomechanics laboratory. Participants: Subjects were 20 healthy, neurologically sound volunteers (age 21.9 ñ 2.1 y, height 174.5 ñ 9.3 cm, mass 79.3 ñ 15.9 kg) with no lower extremity injuries. Interventions: Subjects were prepared for surface electrodes on the peroneus longus (PL), tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (Sol), and medial malleolus (ground). Anthropometric measures for the lower extremity were recorded for use by the Omnikinetic closed chain dynamometer. Measurements were taken prior to ankle effusion (baseline), immediately following effusion (post), and again at 30 minutes. Main Outcome Measurements: Testing consisted of 6 repetitions at 35% of 1-repetition max and a constant speed of 1.5 Hz. Separate two-way MANOVAs with repeated measures on time intervals were used to detect differences between groups (effusion and control) over time for torque, power, and RMS power and for peak and average EMG. Results: An overall time x group interaction was detected for EMG (F<inf>4.72</inf> = 3.878; P = 0.007) and kinetic variables (F<inf>6.70</inf> = 5.55; P = 0.0001). Average and peak PL EMG decreased immediately following effusion (Sidak's; P = 0.048), and average EMG remained depressed 30 minutes following effusion (Sidak's; P = 0.02). Immediately posteffusion, a decrease in ankle torque was detected (Sidak's; P = 0.007). No differences in TA or Sol EMG, power, or RMS power were detected (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Decreases in ankle plantarflexion torque and PL EMG indicate that a neuromuscular deficit exists in the presence of edema that could increase the susceptibility for further ankle injury.",Scopus,10.1097/00042752-200401000-00001,Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine
,,Blackburn et al. (2003),2003,Exercise Sandals Increase Lower Extremity Electromyographic Activity during Functional Activities,"Objective: Anecdotal evidence suggests that use of Exercise Sandals results in a number of positive clinical outcomes. However, little research has been conducted to determine their efficacy objectively. Our purposes were to determine the effect of Exercise Sandals on lower leg electromyography (EMG) during activities in the Exercise Sandals and to compare EMG associated with Exercise Sandals with traditional lower extremity rehabilitation exercises. Design and Setting: Two within-subjects, repeated-measures designs were used to identify differences in lower extremity EMG: (1) between activities with and without Exercise Sandals and (2) between Exercise Sandals activities and traditional rehabilitation activities. All data were collected in the Sports Medicine Research Laboratory. Subjects: Eighteen subjects involved in rehabilitation using Exercise Sandals for at least 2 weeks within the year before data collection. Measurements: Mean EMG amplitudes from the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, soleus, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were measured during single-leg stance, side stepping, and ""high knees,"" all performed with and without the Exercise Sandals, as well as single-leg stance on a foam surface and T-band kicks in the sagittal and frontal planes. Results: Exercise Sandals increased lower leg EMG activity, particularly in the ankle invertors and evertors. Also, activities involving the Exercise Sandals resulted in EMG activity similar to or exceeding that associated with traditional ankle-rehabilitation exercises. Conclusions: These results, coupled with the fact that Exercise Sandals are used in a functional closed kinetic chain manner, suggest that they are an effective means of increasing lower extremity muscle activity.",Scopus,0,Journal of Athletic Training

(2003),2003,Two-year outcomes following ACL reconstruction with allograft tibialis anterior tendons: A retrospective study,"The outcomes of 18 patients (11 females, 7 males; age, 40.4ñ11 years) at 2 years after ACL reconstruction with cryopreserved tibialis anterior allografts using a double bundle technique are presented. Most subjects (72%) described themselves as being moderately active before surgery. After providing written informed consent, subjects completed the 2000 IKDC Knee Form, underwent arthrometric knee measurements, and performed one-leg hop and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring torque tests (60ø/s). Ninety-four percent (17/18) of the subjects had normal or near-normal grades for manual knee ligament tests. Knee arthrometry measurements revealed a mean 1.1-mm involved side increase at 134 N (8.9ñ2mm vs 7.8ñ3 mm) and a 2-mm involved side increase during manual maximum testing (11.3ñ2 mm vs 9.3ñ3 mm). Group means revealed active knee flexion (136ñ8ø vs 139ñ6ø) and knee hyper-extension (3ñ2ø vs 5ñ2ø), which were slightly reduced at the involved knee. One-leg hop testing revealed a 15% mean deficit at the involved side (0.81ñ 0.3 m vs 0.95ñ0.3 m). Isokinetic testing revealed an 11% mean deficit at the involved side (143.4ñ60 Nm vs 161.8ñ54 Nm) for the quadriceps and 7% greater strength at the involved side (105.9ñ35 Nm vs 98.8ñ35 Nm) for the hamstrings. Side-to-side comparisons revealed that many patients displayed less than normal quadriceps femoris torque (72%, 13/18), hamstring torque (28%, 5/18) and hop test (28%, 5/18) performance. Moderate positive correlations existed between involved side quadriceps (r=0.80) and hamstring (r=0.83) torque/bodyweight and hop test performance. Scores were 77.6ñ21 (range 28.7-100) and 78.1ñ16 (range 41.7-100) for the 2000 IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation and Health Assessment forms. Most subjects (83%, 15/18) rated their current function at ò91% of pre-injury levels and all subjects continued to participate at their pre-injury perceived activity level. At 2 years after ACL reconstruction with tibialis anterior allografts, this subject group displayed satisfactory functional outcomes. Tibialis anterior allograft use provides an effective ACL reconstruction alternative, particularly for older individuals who want to continue recreational sports.",Scopus,10.1007/s00167-003-0371-x,"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy"
,,Pearsall Iv et al. (2003),2003,A Biomechanical Comparison of Three Lower Extremity Tendons for Ligamentous Reconstruction about the Knee,"Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate 3 previously unreported allograft tendons for use in knee surgery. These are the doubled tibialis anterior (TA), doubled tibialis posterior (TP), and doubled peroneus longus (PL) tendons. Type of Study. A biomechanical evaluation of the properties of the TA, TP, and PL. Methods: Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were used for testing. All specimens had the TA, TP, and PL tendons harvested. All specimens were tested in a custom-designed hydraulic testing machine using dry ice clamps. Each tendon was elongated at a rate of 1 mm/s. Load and displacement were recorded with an analog to digital interface board. Stiffness, modulus of elasticity, and stress and strain at failure were calculated. Results: The average tested lengths of the TA, TP, and PL were 37 cm (range, 13-68 cm), 33 cm (range, 7-74 cm), and 42 cm (range, 17-69 cm), respectively. The average cross-sectional areas of the doubled TA, TP, and PL were 38 mm2, 48 mm2, and 37 mm2, respectively. The average failure loads for the doubled TA, TP, and PL tendons were 3,412 N, 3,391 N, and 2,483 N, respectively. The maximum stresses of the 3 tendons did not differ significantly (85-108 Mpa). The TA had the greatest stiffness (344 N/mm), followed by the TP (302 N/mm) and the PL (244 N/mm). Previous authors have documented the biomechanical strength of grafts for ACL reconstruction between 1,700 and 2,900 Newtons. The ultimate tensile strength and stiffness reported for the TA and TP grafts exceeded that for all previously reported grafts, including the doubled semitendinosus-gracilis. Conclusions: The TA, TP, and PL tendons showed excellent biomechanical properties when compared with historical data evaluating other graft sources. The biomechanical properties observed for the TA, TP, and PL were noted in specimens despite an average age of 78.3 years.",Scopus,10.1016/j.arthro.2003.10.015,Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery
,,Myers et al. (2003),2003,Effect of peripheral afferent alteration of the lateral ankle ligaments on dynamic stability,"Background: The sensorimotor influence of the lateral ankle ligaments in muscle activation is unclear. Hypothesis: The lateral ankle ligaments have significant sensorimotor influence on muscle activation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Muscle-firing characteristics in response to a high-speed inversion perturbation and during gait were assessed in 13 normal subjects. Solutions (1.5% lidocaine or a placebo of saline) were injected bilaterally into the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments (1.5 ml per ligament) to alter peripheral afferent influence. Subjects were again tested with the same protocol. Results: The protective response of the anterior tibialis and peroneal muscles during inversion perturbation and mean muscle activation amplitude decreased during running after both injections. After injection, no significant differences were seen for muscle reflex latencies, maximum amplitude, time to maximum amplitude during inversion perturbation, or mean amplitude during walking. Conclusion: The lateral ankle ligaments have a sensorimotor influence on muscle activation. Clinical Relevance: Induced edema from the injected solutions may have altered the sensorimotor influence of the lateral ankle ligaments, thereby inhibiting the dynamic ankle stabilizers. This finding suggests that dynamic stability may be compromised because of swelling after joint injury. ? 2003 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1177/03635465030310040401,American Journal of Sports Medicine
,,Hoffman et al. (2003),2003,Simultaneous Hoffmann reflex measurements in multiple muscles around the ankle,"Measurement of the Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) provides an estimate of alpha motoneuron activity in the target motoneuron (MN) pool. The H-reflex has been assessed for a wide variety of reasons in neuroscience research. However, the majority of protocols have focused on the assessment of only one muscle and its corresponding motoneuron pool at any instant. Previously established protocols do not simultaneously assess reflex activity in multiple muscles elicited from a single stimulation. This new protocol allows for assessment of alpha motoneuron activity in three muscles around the ankle joint from a single stimulus to the sciatic nerve. To elicit the responses, the sciatic nerve was stimulated just prior to its bifurcation into the tibial and common peroneal nerves in the popliteal fossa. Electromyographic recording electrodes were placed on the tibialis anterior, peroneal longus, and soleus muscles. The 1-ms square wave pulse was delivered every 15 s during the recruitment curve mapping. The maximum H reflex and M waves were measured in each muscle and their ratios calculated. The measurement of these ratios simultaneously allows for assessment of the cumulative alpha motoneuron activity about the ankle at a given point in time.",Scopus,10.1080/00207450390161912,International Journal of Neuroscience
,,Kocher et al. (2002),2002,Operative versus nonoperative management of acute achilles tendon rupture: Expected-value decision analysis,"Background: The optimal management strategy for acute Achilles tendon rupture is controversial. Purpose: To determine the optimal management by using expected-value decision analysis. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Outcome probabilities were determined from a systematic literature review, and patient-derived utility values were obtained from a visual analog scale questionnaire. A decision tree was constructed, and fold-back analysis was used to determine optimal treatment. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the effect of varying outcome probabilities and utilities on decision-making. Results: Outcome probabilities (expressed as operative; nonoperative) were as follows: well (0.762; 0.846), rerupture (0.022; 0.121), major complication (0.030; 0.025), moderate complication (0.075; 0.003), and mild complication (0.111; 0.005). Outcome utility values were well operative (7.9), well nonoperative (7.0), rerupture (2.6), major complication (1.0), moderate complication (3.5), and mild complication (4.7). Fold-back analysis revealed operative treatment as the optimal management strategy (6.89 versus 6.30). Threshold values were determined for the probability of a moderate complication from operative treatment (0.21) and the utility of rerupture (6.8). Conclusions: Operative management was the optimal strategy, given the outcome probabilities and patient utilities we studied. Nonoperative management was favored by increasing rates of operative complications; operative, by decreasing utility of rerupture. We advocate a model of doctor-patient shared decision-making in which both outcome probabilities and patient preferences are considered. ? 2002 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",Scopus,10.1177/03635465020300060501,American Journal of Sports Medicine
,,Zanetti et al. (2002),2002,Clinical outcome of edema-like bone marrow abnormalities of the foot,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical outcome of edema-like bane marrow abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance (MR) images of the foot when their cause is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical outcome of 31 patients (15 female patients, 16 male patients; mean age, 51; range, 10-79 years) with edema-like bone marrow abnormalities on MR images of the foot was determined. The relevance of three different edema patterns was compared: (a) exclusively ill-defined edema-like zones, (b) edema-like zones plus well-defined necrosis-like zones, and (c) edema-like zones plus linear structures indicating possible fractures. The different edema patterns were compared with persistence of pain. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of all patients had pain persisting after 1 year, as calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The duration of pain in the various subgroups varied significantly (P = .049, log-rank test). The subgroup of patients with a well-defined necrosis-like zone had substantially longer-lasting pain than those with edema-like abnormalities only (n = 16) (P = .065). Only one of seven patients with a well-defined necrosis-like zone (n = 7) was pain free after 1 year. Conversely, patients with possible stress fracture (n = 8) had shorter pain compared with those with edema-like abnormalities only (P = .036); six of eight patients were pain free after 1 year. CONCLUSlON: Edema-like bone marrow abnormalities of the foot predict longlasting pain. Analysis of the image patterns of such abnormalities allows prediction of the clinical outcome to a certain degree.",Scopus,10.1148/radiol.2221010316,Radiology
,,Sugimoto et al. (2002),2002,Reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligaments with bone-patellar tendon graft in patients with chronic ankle instability. A preliminary report,"Background: Unsatisfactory long-term results have been reported after use of a Brostr”m repair for patients with chronic ankle ligament insufficiency. Hypothesis: Repair or reconstruction of both the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments is essential for normal kinematics of the ankle-hindfoot. Study Design: Case series. Methods: Thirteen patients with chronic instability of the ankle were found at operation to have injuries of both the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments, with a lack of healthy ligament margins suitable for suturing. Reconstruction of the ligaments was performed with bone-patellar tendon graft. The score devised by Good et al. was used to assess the patients' clinical condition before the operation and at final follow-up. Results: Before the operation, six patients had a grade 3 clinical condition and seven had a grade 4 condition. At a mean follow-up of 26.5 months, all patients had a grade 1 condition. The average talar tilt of the patients was improved from 18.4ø ñ 5.5ø to 4.9ø ñ 2.6ø, and the average anterior drawer sign was improved from 9.1 ñ 2.6 mm to 5.8 ñ 1.6 mm. Conclusion: In cases of combined injuries, short-term results of reconstruction of the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments using bone-split patellar tendon graft were good, with a low frequency of complications.",Scopus,10.1177/03635465020300030701,American Journal of Sports Medicine
,,Sitler et al. (2000),2000,MR imaging of the foot and ankle: The orthopedic surgeon?s perspective,"The complex anatomy, biomechanics, and associated diagnoses affecting the foot and ankle can be intimidating to the clinician. A systematic and logical approach is necessary to use the diagnostic tools available efficiently to investigate and treat these problems. In most instances, the symptomatic foot can be evaluated with a good history, physical exam, and routine imaging studies. Radiographic examination, including computed tomography (CT), remains the preferred and basic method of evaluating bony anatomy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, as discussed in previous chapters, offers the best imaging of soft-tissue, joint, and bone marrow pathology. In addition, it is a multiplanar technique, which facilitates the evaluation and depicts the relationship of complex anatomic structures in various oblique planes. Using thin-slices, oblique angles, and dedicated surface coils, many authors have illustrated the utility of MR imaging in a foot and ankle orthopedic practice.1-4. ? 2001 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Scopus,0,0
,,Fernandes et al. (2000),2000,Peroneal latency in normal and injured ankles at varying angles of perturbation,"The aim of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in latency of the peroneus longus muscle at varying amplitudes of ankle inversion perturbation and between individuals with and without a history of ankle injury. Thirty-four male athletes from different football codes (soccer, rugby) received four random tilts to their left ankles at 5ø, 10ø, and 15øin the frontal plane on a dual platform trap door. Peroneal latency was defined as the time difference between onset of the trap door movement, as detected by an accelerometer, and the onset of muscle activation above a resting baseline, as recorded using surface electromyography. Latency was determined using an algorithm. A series of repeated measures analyses of variance indicated that the latency was reliable between trials. There was no statistical evidence that history of injury or subjective ankle instability influenced the latency; however, there was a systematic difference between dominant and nondominant legs (dominant, 6.3 ms faster), and there was a small systematic effect (3 ms) for the angle of inversion perturbation. Muscle latency responses in male football players are thought to be influenced more by dominance than by history of injury or amplitude of perturbation.",Scopus,10.1097/00003086-200006000-00023,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research
,,Petersen et al. (2000),2000,Blood supply of the peroneal tendons: Injection and immunohistochemical studies of cadaver tendons,"We studied the vascular pattern of human peroneal tendons with injection techniques and immunohistochemically by using antibodies against laminin. The main blood supply arises from the peroneal artery. The distal part of the peroneus longus tendon is supplied by branches of the medial tarsal artery. Blood vessels enter the peritenon of both tendons via a mesotenon from the posterior aspect. From the peritenon, the blood vessels penetrate the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus tendons and anastomose with a longitudinally-oriented intratendinous network. The amount of vessels in the tendon substance is consistently less than in the surrounding peritenon. The distribution of blood vessels in the peroneal tendons is not homogeneous. In the region where the peroneus brevis tendon passes through the fibular groove, the longitudinally-oriented intratendinous vascular network is interrupted and the tendon is almost avascular. In this region, the tendon is squeezed between the peroneus longus tendon and the bony slide bearing of the lateral malleolus. The peroneus longus tendon has two avascular zones. In the region where the peroneus longus tendon curves around the lateral malleolus and the peroneal trochlea of the calcaneus, the anterior part of the tendon which is directed towards the pulley is avascular. A second avascular zone is located more distally in the region where the tendon changes direction and wraps around the cuboid.",Scopus,10.1080/000164700317413148,Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica
,,Tsuruike et al. (1999),1999,Conditioned patellar tendon-tap reflexes in patients with ACL reconstruction,"The patellar tendon-tap stretch reflexes were examined in six neurologically healthy young subjects (mean age = 27.1 yrs) who had developed persistent quadriceps strength deficit due to ACL reconstruction. Each subject was tested on two separate days. A specially designed apparatus was used to examine the unilateral and conditioned patellar tendon-tap reflex response utilizing three different conditioning intervals: 25 ms, 75 ms, 150 ms, and a unilateral reflex (control). Peak isometric force and contraction time were measured by using a strain gauge. Also, peak-to-peak EMG was measured by using bipolar surface electrodes which were placed over the middle of the rectus femoris. All data were collected with a microcomputer (sample rate = 1 kHz). Due to the small sample, the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance was performed. All subjects demonstrated quadriceps strength deficits in the ACL leg when compared with the contralateral leg. This analysis determined that for both the ACL leg and the Non ACL leg the size of stretch reflex was facilitated at the long-latency conditioning intervals (75 and 150 ms), whereas it was inhibited at the short-latency conditioning interval (25 ms). However, the ANOVA model failed to reveal any differences in the conditioned stretch reflex between the ACL leg and the Non ACL leg. Also, no differences were observed at the unilateral condition. Taken together, these results indicate that ACL reconstruction results in significant strength deficits, but does not alter unilateral or conditioned reflex profiles.",Scopus,10.1055/s-2007-971128,International Journal of Sports Medicine
,,Fiori et al. (1996),1996,"Muscle fiber splitting, capillary internalization, and target-like fiber formation in familiar amyloidotic polyneuropathy","A case of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is reported in which peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from the right leg to assess the severity of the relatively late-onset but rapid-evolving neuropathy. The present paper deals with some remarkable features found in the muscular biopsy, taken from peroneus brevis and extensor digitorum longus muscles. Several fibers contained amyloid masses characterized by Congo red positivity and birefringence on polarized light microscopy: histoenzymologic staining revealed that these fibers were always type 2B and appeared grossly hypertrophied. The presence of amyloid inside the muscle fibers was possibly dependent on the internalization of capillaries leading to direct deposition of amyloid fibrils into the sarcoplasm. Fiber vascularization occurred independently of fiber splitting, which appeared to be frequent in both muscles and was characterized by unusual segmental changes in the histochemical properties of the daughter fibers with respect to those of the parent fiber. Target/targetoid and degenerating areas were also observed in a large number of type 2 fibers, usually in close relationship with segmental splitting phenomena. These findings were interpreted as possible secondary myopathic changes accompanying chronic denervation-reinnervation episodes in the course of FAP.",Scopus,0,Clinical Neuropathology

,,Klein et al. (1996),1996,Moment arm length variations of selected muscles acting on talocrural and subtalar joints during movement: An in vitro study,"The tendon excursion method was applied to estimate the moment arm length of triceps surae, flexor hallucis longus, tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, peroneus brevis and peroneus longus at talocrural and subtalar joints of 10 anatomical preparations. Orthogonal polynomials were fitted to the tendon excursion data and by derivation with respect to the joint angle, the instantaneous moment arm length for any joint position was evaluated. Both joints were investigated separately. Individual data, the mean moment arm together with the significant moment arm coefficients of the polynomials are presented. Considering their moment arm, the most important plantar flexor were triceps surae, flexor hallucis longus and to a much lesser extent peroneus longus, peroneus brevis and tibialis posterior. Results suggest a partially new insight into the muscle action at the subtalar joint. Although displaying a mean inversion moment arm of about -5.3 mm over the whole range of motion, triceps surae had an inversion moment arm in eversion and an eversion one in inversion. Tibialis posterior exhibited the most important inversion moment arm (-19.1 mm), whereas tibialis anterior had a very low one (-3.8 mm). For some specimens this muscle was found to have an eversion moment arm. Peronei longus and brevis had a nearly identical moment arm at the subtalar joint (21.8 and 20.5 mm).",Scopus,10.1016/0021-9290(95)00025-9,Journal of Biomechanics

We sub jected 15 ankles in 13 patients with symptoms of chronic lateral instability to sudden angular displacement. The reaction times in the peroneus longus and the tibialis anterior muscles were recorded and compared with those from 15 control ankles. Significantly longer ipsi lateral reaction time was recorded in the patients (65 ms) compared with the controls (49 ms).

The specimens were procured at the time of second-look arthroscopy from the superficial region of the midzone of the anterior cruciate ligament grafts after synovial clearage. The grafts used for the anterior cruciate ligament recon structions were from fresh-frozen allogenic Achilles, tibialis anterior or posterior, or peroneus longus or bre vis tendons and had been implanted 3 to 96 months previously. By 12 months after surgery, the anterior cru ciate ligament allografts consisted predominantly of small-diameter collagen fibrils (30 to 80 nm), which re sulted in a unimodal pattern in the collagen fibril profile. The number of large-diameter fibrils (90 to 140 nm) within the allogenic tendon grafts had decreased. This predominance of small-diameter collagen fibrils per sisted in almost all specimens older than 12 months. The anterior cruciate ligament allografts had collagen fibril profiles that did not resemble normal tendon grafts or normal anterior cruciate ligaments, even several years after surgery. ? 1995, SAGE Publications.

After the dogs had been killed, short?term culture and labeling in vitro were utilized to determine rates of DNA, proteoglycan, collagen, and noncollagen protein synthesis. Schiff base covalent collagen crosslink concentrations and total collagen and protein content also were evaluated at intervals through 6 weeks. Tendon grafts of extrasynovial origin showed greater rates of DNA synthesis and significantly elevated levels of proteoglycan, collagen, and noncollagen protein synthesis and Schiff base covalent collagen crosslink concentrations (dihydroxylysinonorleucine) compared with intrasynovial tendon grafts. It was not clear to what extent the increased activity in the extrasynovial graft was due to actual differences between the intrasynovial and extrasynovial tendons or to the responses of the connective tissue surrounding the extrasynovial tendon graft. Since both types of grafts demonstrated similar unaltered levels of collagen and protein content over time, these data suggest greater rates of matrix turnover in tendon grafts of extrasynovial origin than in those of intrasynovial origin. Coupled with previous findings showing increased cellular proliferation in extrasynovial tendon grafts, these data indicate that the process of translation to an intrasynovial environment necessitates a more active process of soft?tissue repair and remodeling when extrasynovial donor tendons are used.

Rabbits were injected intramuscularly with prednisolone for 2 weeks. Specimens from lumbal skin and from tendons of peroneus tertius and longus were tested in a materialstesting machine. The prednisolone treatment resulted in increased maximum ""stress"" value for skin and for the tendon of peroneus tertius increased maximum ""stress"" value and relative failure energy. The tendon of peroneus longus was used for analysis of rheological properties using a testing program, which is presented. No influence was found on the viscous properties, while the elastic stiffness measured after exhaustion of the viscous properties was increased by the prednisolone treatment. From this can be concluded that 2 weeks of prednisolone treatment increased the strength of skin and muscle tendon. When the viscous properties, which seemed unchanged by prednisolone, were exhausted the stiffness of muscle tendon was found to be increased. It is suggested that these changes induced by prednisolone are caused by an increased stabilization of the fibrillar aggregates of collagen molecules. ? 1981.",Scopus,10.1016/0021-9290(81)90018-X,Journal of Biomechanics

Specimens from the peroneal tendons, the posterior cruciate ligament with bone attachments, and strips of skin from the dorsum, were tested in a materials testing machine. the local treatment resulted in increased tensile strength of the peroneus brevis tendon and increased maximum load and stiffness of the peroneus longus tendon with no change in the collagen content in any of the samples. the posterior cruciate ligament always broke at one of the two sites of attachment to the bone and the maximum load value at these points was decreased after local Cortisol treatment. the systemic effects of this local Cortisol treatment on the skin were decreased thickness and fat content, increased collagen concentration and higher tensile strength and failure energy. from this study it is concluded that local Cortisol injections for 24 days increase the strength and stiffness of muscle tendons, but decrease the strength of the bone attachments of ligaments. This treatment also results in a systemic effect which shows itself as increased strength of the skin remote from the site of the injections. ? 1980 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",Scopus,10.3109/17453678008990791,Acta Orthopaedica
,,Arnold et al. (1974),1974,Biomechanical and rheological properties of human tendons; Biomechanische und rheologische Eigenschaften menschlicher Sehnen,"1. Methods of Investigation. We have examined the biomechanical properties of about 300 tendons of the human foot (tendon of the M. extensor digitorum longus, M. extensor hallucis longus, M. peroneus tertius, M. tibialis anterior). The tendons had been taken from autopsies. With a technical tensile testing machine force-elongation, tensile strength, and rheological diagrams have been recorded. 2. Force-Length Relations. Tendons have considerable elastic, some viscous and little plastic properties. In force-elongation diagrams we can see with great regularity a lower non-linear, after that a nearly proportional, and then a short upper nonlinear part. The lower nonlinear part depends on the preloads. When a tendon is stored under relieved tension for some hours until weeks the lower nonlinear parts of the first three or four loading cycles are different from each other. 3. Relaxation. The relaxation depends on the previous rate of strain. The higher the rate of strain is, the deeper is the relaxation under unchanged other experimental conditions (initial force, length between grips). Long tendons show weeker relaxations than short ones under equal loads. The larger the initial stress is, the steeper is the tangent of the relaxation curve in the beginning and the more time passes until an asymptotic approximation occurs. The relaxation curve is a composed e-function with negative exponents. The relaxation behaviour is only under special conditions independent from previous stepwise relaxation phases. We have called diagramms of the corresponding experimental device cascade relaxation. The larger the intervalls of time between the load phases, the deeper are the relaxations. In dehydrated tendons the relaxation phenomenon is more pronounced than in wet ones. 4. Recovery Curves. When we stretch and then immediately release a tendon partly, the stress or force increases under constant strain or length initially fastly and then slowly approximating a boundary value. Secondary relaxations can occur. We call the force-time or stress-time curve of the recovery phenomenon, recovery force, force or stress regain, recovery curve, mechanical recovery curve, force regain curve. Generally the recovery curve is a composed e-function and the solution function of a rheological constitutive equation of the tendon. The recovery depends on the velocity of the deloading. The higher the deloading velocity is, the more distinct is the recovery diagram within certain limits. When a relaxation is interposed the recovery is more distinct than after a direct loading-deloading transition. The maximal recovery force can be gained in the lower third of the previous maximum load. The recovery curve approximates a straight line (isorheological line), when it begins close to the previous maximum load or near the zero force line. The recovery curves are under certain conditions independent from previous interponed cascade recovery diagrams. After long interponed relaxation phases the mechanical recovery depends almost not on the strain rate but on the strain release rate. 5. Damping. The viscous properties of tendons cause damping phenomena. The damping can be demonstrated by hysteresis. The area of the hysteresis loop corresponds to the loss energy. This draw back of tendons is balanced by certain advantages of damping: vibrations are prevented, the mechanical moments are reduced in dependence on the strain rate. The hysteresis loops are velocity dependent. ? 1974 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,10.1007/BF00519870,Zeitschrift fur Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte
