Methods: 66 patients undergoing arthroscopic ACL reconstruction were randomized into 2 groups: 34 allografts and 32 xenografts treated to attenuate the host immune response. Follow-up was 24-month minimum. Anterior knee stability was measured as KT − 1000 side-to-side laxity difference (respect to the contralateral healthy knee). Functional performance was assessed by one-legged hop test. Objective manual pivot-shift test and subjective (IKDC, Tegner and SF-36) outcomes were collected. MRI and standard X-Ray were performed. Results: 61 subjects (32 allograft, 29 xenograft) were evaluated at 12 and 24 months. Six of the subjects in xenograft group (20.6%) got an infection attributed to a water-based pathogen graft contamination in processing. Intention-to-treat analysis (using the last observation carried forward imputation method) revealed higher KT − 1000 laxity in xenograft group at 24-month follow-up (P =.042). Also pivot-shift was higher in xenograft group at 12-month (P =.015) and 24-month follow-up (P =.038). Per-protocol analysis (missing/contaminated subjects excluded) did not revealed clinical differences between groups. Tibial tunnel widening in the allograft group was low, whereas xenograft tunnel widening was within the expected range of 20–35% as reported in the literature. No immunological reactivity was associated to xenograft group. Conclusions: High infection rate (20.6%) was reported in xenograft group. Both groups of patients achieved comparable clinical outcomes if missing/contaminated subjects are excluded. Improved harvesting/processing treatments in future studies using xenografts for ACL reconstruction are needed to reduce infection rate, otherwise xenograft should not be used in ACL reconstruction.

Our hypothesis was that use of an autogenous bone plug, instead of a bioabsorbable interference screw, for secondary fixation of tendon allograft to the proximal part of the tibia would reduce the complication rate and tibial tunnel widening. Methods: We prospectively reviewed the cases of eighty-one patients (average age, 32.0 years) who had undergone ACL reconstruction with Achilles tendon allograft between 2000 and 2006. A bioabsorbable interference screw was used for the tibial tunnel in forty-one patients (group I). These patients were compared with forty patients in whom autogenous bone from the tibia had been used (group II). The two groups were assessed with use of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, and Tegner activity scores and with KT2000 arthrometer testing. The cross-sectional area perpendicular to the long axis of the tibial tunnel was calculated digitally with use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: No significant differences were seen between the two groups with respect to IKDC, Lysholm, or Tegner activity scores or the results of laxity testing with arthrometry. A total of fourteen complications (34%) occurred in group I. In contrast, six complications (15%) were seen in group II (p = 0.046). The mean cross-sectional area enlargement was 38% in group I and 15% in group II (p = 0.017). Conclusions: The clinical results associated with bioabsorbable screws and bone plugs were not significantly different. Laxity evaluation demonstrated no significant differences between bioabsorbable screws and bone plugs. Compared with bioabsorbable interference screws, autogenous bone plugs reduced the complication rate and tibial tunnel widening without inducing instability. We believe that an autogenous bone plug for the tibial tunnel is a reasonable option in selected patients. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level II.

A Prospective and Consecutive Clinical Evaluation of Soft Tissue Regeneration's L-C Ligament® in Primary ACL Reconstruction,,,,,,5/27/2025,5/27/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2012). Date of Publication: 22 Jun 2012,clinicaltrials.gov,2012,,,,,22-Jun-12,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a resorbable polymer implant (Soft Tissue Regeneration's L-C Ligament) for replacement and regeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Approximately 15 patients at 2-3 different hospitals in Europe will participate in this study. The hypothesis of this study is that the L-C Ligament will successfully regenerate the ACL with clinical outcomes similar to or better than surgical intervention with auto graft tissue.Detailed DescriptionReconstruction of the ACL is currently recommended as the standard of care following an ACL tear or rupture. The ACL has poor healing potential and repair of the damaged tissue is rarely successful. The gold standard for reconstruction of the ACL is autograft tissue, with the patellar and hamstring tendons the most common. The limitations of autograft are donor site morbidity and pain, and potential damage of the remaining tissue at the harvest site. Other problems include a limited amount of tendon available for harvesting, unpredictable resorption characteristics, and increased recovery time. Allografts are tissues such as patellar, hamstring, and Achilles tendons obtained from cadavers. The advantages of surgery with allograft are less pain and scarring, decreased surgical time, and faster rehabilitation. However, allografts can transmit disease, may elicit an unfavorable immunogenic response, and incorporate slower than autograft. Also, allografts cannot be sterilized without damaging the tissue, leading to a choice between a risk of bacterial infection and decreased tensile strength and healing potential. The proposed study is a prospective, consecutive, non-randomized, multicentre clinical trial conducted at up to five European sites, wherein 15 study subjects will undergo primary ACL reconstruction with the L-C Ligament. After screening procedures are completed, eligible study subjects who provide written informed consent will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will undergo preoperative clinical, MRI, and radiographic evaluations and undergo primary ACL reconstruction. Follow-up clinical evaluations will be performed post-op (range 1-8 weeks), 3 months (± 3 weeks), 6 months (± 3 weeks), 12 months (± 1 month), and 24 months (± 2 months) after surgery. Assessment of safety (i.e., assessment of adverse events and complications), pain, and clinical function as well as imaging will occur. In accordance with a separate radiographic protocol, analysis and scoring of MRI images (pre-op, 1 and 2 years), radiographs (pre- and post- op), and a CT scan post-op and at 1-year will be undertaken by an independent radiologist who will be masked to the identities of the subjects and clinical investigators. Outcome measures for imaging include position of the bone tunnels and interference screws, indirect evidence of ligament tissue remodeling, and evidence of tunnel-widening. Evidence of OA will also be monitored. The Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators will ensure that complications observed on radiographs, MRI, and CT images are reported to their ethics committee and the sponsor. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the L-C Ligament in primary ACL reconstruction. Safety will be evaluated by the occurrence, frequency, and severity of intra- and post- operative complications; the primary end point is one year and follow-up wil be performed for a minimum of two years. Clinical function will be assessed with the IKDC-2000 Scale and functionality of the device at two years follow-up. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine efficacy by objectively and subjectively measuring pain, function, and the results of image analyses of the L-C Ligament in primary ACL reconstruction. Objective measures include the Lachman test, the anterior drawer test, the KT-1000 Arthrometer, the pivot-shift test, and the single-leg hop test. Pre- and post- operative objective and subjective measures include the Tegner and Lysholm scales. Pre- and post- op radiographs, MRI images pre-op, and at 1 and 2 years, and post-op and 1-year CT scans will be analyzed for position of the bone tunnels and screws, indirect evidence of ligament tissue remodeling, and evidence of widening of the bone tunnels.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT01634711,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01634711,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT01634711&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Bone Tunnel Widening Following ACL Reconstruction,,,,,,5/14/2025,5/14/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2005). Date of Publication: 13 Sep 2005,clinicaltrials.gov,2005,,,,,13-Sep-05,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryHypothesis 1: There is less tunnel-widening with bone-patella tendon-bone graft compared with the hamstring graft when the same fixation method is used. Tunnel widening is greater with achilles tendon allografts versus autograft bone-patella tendon-bone and hamstring autografts. Hypothesis 2: Tunnel widening occurs in the early post-operative period (\< 8 weeks) when the tendon remodels within the bone tunnels. Hypothesis 3: Low pre-operative bone mineral density is associated with tunnel widening.Detailed DescriptionThis will be a prospective study for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction using bone-patella tendon-bone graft, hamstring graft or achilles allograft. Each group will have ACL reconstruction with fixation using bioabsorbable interference screws on the femoral and tibial side. Patients will be evaluated on the day of surgery, 6, 12, 24, 52 and 104 weeks post-operatively. Evaluations will include pre-operative regional and standard bone mineral density measurements, post-operative MRI evaluation of tunnel dimensions and bone-tendon interface, radiographic evaluation of tunnel dimensions and routine clinical follow-up. Interventions or Observations - outline specific procedures, treatments and/or interventions, as well as sources of research material to be utilized, which will involve human subjects or human materials that will be part of this research project. This study will require a pre-operative bone mineral density measurement in the Nuclear Medicine Division of the Department of Radiology at HSS. Standard measurements of the femoral neck, spine as well as regional studies of the distal femur and proximal tibia of the injured knee will be performed. On the day of surgery, the patient will undergo ACL reconstruction using bioabsorbable interference screw fixation of the hamstring, bone-patella tendon-bone graft, or achilles allograft. This is a standard procedure. The choice of graft type (hamstring, bone-patella tendon-bone graft, or achilles allograft) will be discussed with the patients and the patient will decide graft type pre-operatively. In this study, we will standardize the fixation method by using bioabsorbable interference screws. Post-operatively, the patient will undergo a limited MRI scan to evaluate the tunnel dimensions as well as graft placement prior to discharge from the hospital. During the patients' 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks clinical follow-up, they will be evaluated by their orthopaedic surgeon for clinical progress. Standard radiographs will be obtained of the patient's knee at the 6 weeks and 24 weeks follow-up visit. These are standard radiographic evaluations and are of no additional charge to the patients. We will utilize these images for radiographic measurements of tunnel expansion. During these visits, the patients will also undergo limited MRI scan of the femoral tunnel and tibia tunnel. With the serial MRI images, we will be able to make accurate measurements of the femoral and tibial tunnels. In addition, we will be able to evaluate the bone-tendon interface as well as the maturation of the intra-articular portion of the ACL graft. At 24, 52 and 104 weeks the patients will also be given standard IKDC and Lysholm clinical knee outcome questionnaires and will have objective stability measurements of both the operative and non-operative knees using a KT-1000 instrument. Overall Study Protocol: Pre-operative work-up 1. Bone mineral density measurement by D.E.X.A. Day of Surgery: 1. ACL reconstruction using bioabsorbable interference screws 2. Limited CT scans to quantitate tunnel dimensions 6 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up 2. Regular plain radiographs to quantitate tunnel dimensions 3. Limited MRI scans to quantitate tunnel dimensions 12 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up 2. Limited MRI scans to quantitate tunnel dimensions 24 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up and KT-1000 measurements 2. Regular plain radiographs to quantitate tunnel dimensions 3. MRI study to evaluate tendon-bone interface, graft maturation, tunnel dimensions and trabecular remodeling 4. Patients will answer IKDC and Lysholm knee questionnaires 52 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up and KT-1000 measurements 2. Patients will answer IKDC and Lysholm knee questionnaires 3. Limited MRI 104 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up and KT-1000 measurements 2. Patients will answer IKDC and Lysholm knee questionnaires 3. Limited MRI Number of Subjects (power justification for numbers) A power analysis was performed to determine the number of subjects needed to determine significance between the hamstring and bone-patella tendon-bone group. Data from previous studies demonstrate tunnel widening up to 77 ± 28% following ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendons. We estimate that a 30% decrease in this amount of tunnel widening would be clinically significant. This extrapolates to a 54% increase in tunnel dimensions. Using these estimations, a power of 0.80 with α = 0.5 is achieved using 20 subjects per group (BPTB versus hamstring).",,,,English,English,,,LNCT00198042,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00198042,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT00198042&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.
