Although ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is standard, graft failure rates remain high in young active patients. This study investigated whether combining ACLR with anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction (ALLR) reduces grafts failure compared with ACLR. Methods: In this prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled trial conducted at the Santy Orthopedic Center in Lyon, France, patients aged 18–35 years with symptomatic ACL rupture were randomly allocated (1:1) to ACL + ALL reconstruction using hamstring tendon autograft (ACLR + ALLR) or ACLR with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (ACLR). Randomisation was performed with a block size of four using telematic software by an independent study coordinator, with concealed allocation. Surgeons were informed of the assigned procedure on the morning of surgery. Outcome assessors were not blinded. The primary outcome was graft failure at 5 years, assessed clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by an independent sports medicine physicians not involved in the index surgery. Efficacy analyses were performed on the Full Analysis Set in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle, while safety analyses were conducted on the Safety Set. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID NCT03740022. The trial has been completed. Findings: Between November 11, 2016, and January 20, 2020, 593 patients were randomized (297 assigned to ACLR + ALLR and 296 to ACLR). The mean age was 25.0 years (SD 4.5); 447 (75%) participants were male and 146 (25%) female. Of these 593 patients, 556 (94%) completed a mean 5-year follow-up. Graft failure occurred in 12/283 (4.2%) with ACLR + ALLR versus 28/273 (10.3%) with ACLR (p = 0.006; adjusted odds ratio 2.54 [95% CI 1.27; 5.36]—p = 0.008). The number needed to treat was 17 overall, and 9 in patients younger than 25 years. Interpretation: In our study of young, active adults with ACL rupture, who are considered high-risk for graft failure, combining ACL reconstruction with anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ACLR + ALLR) significantly decreased graft failure compared with ACLR. These results suggest that ACLR + ALLR might be beneficial for young or highly active individuals and provide a basis for future research to refine patient selection, evaluate long-term outcomes beyond five years, and explore benefits in other subgroups of patients with ACL injuries.

METHODS: While 153 patients were prospectively recruited and randomized to an ST or STG autograft, 131 (62 ST and 69 STG) were retained following ACLR and followed post-surgery. Standardized surgical techniques were employed, varying only in graft selection and fixation. The primary study outcomes were early hamstring pain, donor site morbidity and strength recovery. However, several outcomes were assessed pre-surgery and at 3 and 6 months, encompassing the Donor-site-related Functional Problems following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (DFPACLR) score, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for hamstring pain and other commonly employed PROMs, anteroposterior laxity (KT-1000), isokinetic hamstring and quadriceps strength, hop testing, complications and re-operations. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using linear mixed models for continuous data and Mann-Whitney U tests where appropriate. RESULTS: At 6 months, ST patients reported significantly lower hamstring pain (p < 0.001) and DFPACLR (p < 0.001) scores. A significantly higher (p < 0.001) peak knee flexor strength limb symmetry index (LSI) was observed for the ST group, though no other group differences in side-to-side laxity, hop tests or other normalized strength measures or LSIs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: ACLR using an ST autograft resulted in less donor site pain and morbidity, and improved knee flexor strength symmetry at 6 months, while demonstrating comparable functional outcomes to the STG autograft.

Patients and methods: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 ± 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 ± 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 ± 3.9 (range = 85–100). Conclusion: Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.

Patients and methods: This study enrolled 50 sports-active patients with anteromedial bundle injuries for primary standalone ACL reconstruction. In group I (20 patients with a BMI of 24.36 ± 2.32, and a mean age of 40.65 ± 11.43) the Jewel ACL synthetic graft was implemented, while in group II (30 patients with a BMI of 24.82 ± 3.25, and a mean age of 35.57 ± 7.18) the ST autograft was used, both with the same surgical technique. Pre- and postoperative assessments included ROM, Lachman, Pivot Shift, KT 1000, IKDC 2000, Cincinnati, Lysholm, Tegner scores, and time to return to sport. Results: There was no statistical difference between the JewelACL and ST groups in ROM or scores. The JewelACL group returned earlier to participation at 2.6 months and to sports at 4.65 months, compared to 5.2 and 10.87 months for the ST group. On the day of surgery, 25 % of the JewelACL group and 37 % of the ST group had positive Pivot Shift tests. At 24 months, all JewelACL patients had negative results, while 10 % of the ST group remained positive. Three cases of hematoma at the donor site were noted in the ST group but none in the JewelACL group. Conclusions: ACL reconstruction with both the ST autograft and JewelACL synthetic ligament provided similarly positive outcomes across nearly all measured scores. The JewelACL technique allows for a faster return to training and sports activities.

In ACL reconstruction (ACL-R), multiple autograft options are available, each with distinct advantages and limitations. The quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft has gained increasing attention due to its favorable biomechanical properties and lower donor site morbidity, yet studies comparing only athletic populations remains limited. This study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to compare QT autograft with bone-block (QT-B) with semitendinosus tendon (ST) autograft in athletes undergoing primary ACL-R. Methods: This is a single center RCT. Two Hundred ACL-R patients aged 16–40 years with a Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) of ≥ 7 prior to the ACL injury will be randomized to receive either a ST graft or a QT-B graft at the time of ACL-R. All participants will receive standard postoperative care and rehabilitation, followed by comprehensive follow-up. The primary outcome was the side-to-side (STS) difference in anterior tibial translation (ATT) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), isokinetic strength testing, imaging-based graft evaluation, surgical and clinical events, and 10-year radiographic evidence of joint degeneration. Detailed definitions and timepoints are provided in the full manuscript (Table 1). Discussion: This protocol is the first RCT comparing the ST autograft to the QT-B autograft exclusively in athletes with TAS ≥ 7 undergoing ACL-R. In addition, this trial has the ambition of including 200 patients, thereby making it the largest trial to compare these two grafts to date. The successful completion of the trial has the potential to change current practice and contribute to the existing knowledge regarding graft choice in athletes undergoing ACL-R.

Methods: This was a randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from April 2022 to October 2023 at a tertiary care center. One hundred patients with isolated, unilateral, chronic ACL tears were randomised 1:1 to receive either an intra-articular injection containing TXA (1 g), morphine sulphate, ketorolac, lidocaine and normal saline (intervention group) or an identical injection without TXA (control group). All surgeries were performed using hamstring autografts and standardised surgical and postoperative protocols. All patients received 15 mg/kg intravenous TXA in addition to intra-articular TXA. The primary outcomes were pain scores (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS) at predefined time points up to 3 months. The secondary outcomes were Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm scores, range of motion, swelling and morphine consumption. Results: Postoperative pain scores did not differ significantly between groups at any time point (p > 0.05). Both groups demonstrated significant within-group improvements over time in KOOS subscores (p < 0.001) and Lysholm scores (p < 0.001). Postoperative morphine consumption was similar in both groups (p > 0.05). The TXA group had better Lysholm scores at 1 month (85.8 ± 9.1 vs. 79.6 ± 13.9; p < 0.01). The TXA group had significantly better KOOS subscores and Lysholm scores at 3 months with moderate effect size (p < 0.01). No serious complications were observed in either group.

Thirty adolescent athletes (ages 14-18) who underwent ACLR were randomly allocated to either the control group receiving traditional postoperative rehabilitation (n = 15) or the intervention group combining BOSU ball training with resistance exercises (n = 15). Joint stability, proprioception, strength, and functional outcomes were assessed before the procedure, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the operation using the KT-1000 arthrometer, Y-balance test, isokinetic dynamometry, and the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale. The intervention group demonstrated notably better anterior-posterior knee joint stability (P < .05) than the control group at the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups after the surgery, greater reach distances in the Star Excursion Balance Test (P < .05), higher quadriceps and hamstring strength ratios (P < .05), and superior ACL-RSI scores (P < .01).

This study evaluates the potential impact of combined modified LET with ACLR versus ACLR alone on the rate of return to high-impact military activities, which we call return to sports (RTSs), and the subsequent rate of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft failure. Materials and Methods: A total of 198 soldiers with primary ACL tears with a high-grade pivot test (grade 3) were included and randomized using the simple randomized method and divided into two groups. A consecutive cohort of military personnel with an isolated ACL tear undergoing ACLR with modified LET (group A, n = 116) and ACLR alone (group B, n = 82) were analyzed between 2016 and 2021. Both groups were followed up for a minimum of 2 years. Soldiers underwent a survey evaluating knee function (knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score [KOOS]), RTS criteria (RTS type), symptoms (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] subjective), activity level (Tegner score), and fear of movement (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-11) to assess psychological readiness for sport participation. Results: Among these, a mean age of 32 ± 2.93 years underwent primary ACLR with modified LET (n = 116) or without LET (n = 82) procedure. A total of 31 soldiers (15.6%) experienced ACL graft failure, including 26 (31.7%) reconstructions without LET and 5 (4.3%) with LET. Combined with LET during primary ACLR, it lowered the risk of graft failure by 2.8 times. Multivariable analysis revealed a significant reduction in graft rupture risk (relative risk = 0.325, P = 0.029) associated with LET compared to ACLR alone after adjusting for age, anthropometric factors, and tibial slopes. 105 out of 113 (90.5%) soldiers were able to return to military duty in group A (combined ACLR with modified LET), whereas 51 of 81 (62.9%) of the soldiers who underwent ACLR alone (group B) returned to military duty (P = 0.05). Conclusion: At 24 months postoperatively, combined ACLR plus LET showed a significantly higher RTS rate than ACLR alone. The combined ACLR with the modified LET group also showed a lower failure rate than the ACLR alone group.

Rehabilitation timing, particularly early versus delayed initiation, can influence postoperative muscle strength outcomes, especially in hamstring tendon autograft cases. While early rehabilitation may promote faster recovery, concerns about graft protection and joint stability have limited its universal adoption. This study aimed to compare the effects of early and delayed rehabilitation protocols on quadriceps and hamstring strength symmetry after ACLR using hamstring tendon autografts. Materials and Methods:A prospective comparative study was conducted on 60 patients (mean age: 26.4 ± 4.8 years) undergoing primary ACLR with semitendinosus-gracilisautograft. Patients were randomized into two groups: Early Rehabilitation Group (ERG) (n = 30), commencing structured physiotherapy within 2 weeks post-surgery, and Delayed Rehabilitation Group (DRG) (n = 30), starting at 6 weeks post-surgery. Isokinetic dynamometry assessed quadriceps and hamstring peak torque at 60°/s and 180°/s at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Strength symmetry index (SSI) was calculated as the ratio of the operated to non-operated limb strength × 100. Statistical analysis included repeated measures ANOVA with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: At 3 months, ERG demonstrated significantly higher quadriceps SSI (81.6 ± 5.3%) compared to DRG (72.4 ± 6.1%, p < 0.001) and hamstring SSI (86.9 ± 4.7% vs 78.2 ± 5.6%, p < 0.001). At 6 months, the differences persisted (quadriceps SSI: 91.2 ± 3.8% vs 85.4 ± 4.1%, p = 0.002; hamstring SSI: 93.1 ± 3.5% vs 88.0 ± 3.9%, p = 0.004). By 12 months, both groups achieved near-symmetrical strength, with no significant difference (quadriceps SSI: 97.3 ± 2.4% vs 96.1 ± 2.8%, p = 0.18). No graft failures or significant complications were reported in either group. Conclusion: Early initiation of rehabilitation following hamstring tendon autograft ACLR resulted in faster recovery of lower limb strength symmetry during the first 6 months post-surgery without increasing complication risk. However, by one year, both early and delayed protocols achieved comparable strength outcomes, suggesting early rehabilitation primarily benefits short- to mid-term recovery.",,,,English,English,,,L2040075838,10.69605/ijlbpr_14.7.2025.278,http://dx.doi.org/10.69605/ijlbpr_14.7.2025.278,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2040075838&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=22503137&id=doi:10.69605%2Fijlbpr_14.7.2025.278&atitle=Impact+of+early+versus+delayed+rehabilitation+protocols+on+lower+limb+strength+symmetry+after+hamstring+tendon+autograft+ACL+reconstruction&stitle=Int.+J.+Life+Sci.+Biotechnol.+Pharma+Res.&title=International+Journal+of+Life+Sciences+Biotechnology+and+Pharma+Research&volume=14&issue=7&spage=1656&epage=1660&aulast=Kadivar&aufirst=Yash&auinit=Y.&aufull=Kadivar+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1656-1660&date=2025&auinit1=Y&auinitm=,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

METHODS: After recruitment and randomisation, 112 patients (HT = 55; QT = 57) underwent ACLR. Patients were assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months using the Kneeling Tolerance Test, which evaluates patient-reported pain in a position of both 90 (KT90) and 110 (KT110) degrees of knee flexion. PROMs collected included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire and the ACL Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) questionnaire. RESULTS: Kneeling tolerance at KT90 and KT110 improved (p < 0.05) for both graft types across all time points. There was no difference in KT90 scores between groups at 6 or 12 months. At 24 months, kneeling tolerance was superior in the QT group (mean HT 93 ± 9 vs. QT 98 ± 5; p = 0.003). For KT110 scores, a statistically significant difference was noted at 6 (mean HT 80 ± 25 vs. QT 89 ± 12; p = 0.027), 12 (mean HT 90 ± 13 vs. QT 95 ± 10; p = 0.040) and 24 months (mean HT 92 ± 10 vs. QT 97 ± 5; p = 0.003).

To mitigate this, a tendon-sparing ST-only graft has been explored. However, less is known of the mid- to long-term outcomes comparing these configurations. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose was to investigate differences between the quadrupled ST tendon graft and the doubled ST/G graft configuration. The primary hypothesis was that there would be no difference in the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SF) outcomes between groups. The secondary hypothesis was that there would be no differences in knee flexion strength, KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side measurements, or need for secondary surgery (including revision) between the 2 techniques. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: At baseline, 98 patients were randomized to receive either the quadrupled ST tendon graft or the doubled ST/G graft configuration. Preoperatively and after 2 and median 8 years (range, 5-10 years) postoperatively, the investigators collected results for the IKDC-SF, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Tegner Activity Scale, a sports and activity participation questionnaire, knee laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer) side-to-side measurements, Lachman test, and flexion rotation drawer test. Need for secondary knee surgery was evaluated 5 to 10 years postoperatively. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients completed median 8-year follow-up (range, 5-10 years): 38 patients in the ST group and 39 patients in the ST/G group. No statistically significant differences were observed between the ST and ST/G groups in IKDC-SF scores (81.7 vs 82.1; P = .93), knee stability, or revision rates. Both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in self-reported function (P < .001) until final follow-up. The overall anterior cruciate ligament revision rate was 10.4%, and no increased risk of graft failure or excessive residual laxity was associated with the ST-only graft. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences were found between the ST group and the ST/G group in terms self-reported function, knee laxity, or need for secondary surgery at median 8 years (range, 5-10 years) after surgery.

Saunders,"Purpose: To compare various medial collateral ligament (MCL) management strategies (repair vs isolated suture-tape bracing vs no repair) combined with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and analyze the results of MCL subtypes (femoral-sided, mid-substance, and tibial-sided tears) that occur at distinct levels. Methods: This study was a double-blind, prospective 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Ninety-six consecutive patients with combined ACL and grade III MCL acute & subacute injuries between 2020 and 2022 with minimum 24-month follow-up were included in the study. Chronic MCL injuries and other ligament injuries were excluded, and computer-generated randomization was performed for allotment into 3 MCL management groups. ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft was performed and the MCL underwent repair in group 1 (n = 33), isolated suture-tape-bracing in group 2 (n = 32), and no repair in group 3 (n = 31). At follow-up, stress radiographs were used to analyze anterior and medial laxity. The International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, duration of surgery, and cost of surgery were compared. In addition, subgroup analysis was performed to assess outcomes based on location of MCL injury. Results: Demographic data, duration of injury, mode of injury, and distinct level of MCL injury were similar across groups. Overall, the incidence rates of MCL tears on the femoral side, at the midsubstance, and on the tibial side were 58.3%, 18.7%, and 23.0%, respectively. Postoperatively, significant improvements in range of motion (ROM) and functional scores were observed in all 3 groups (P ≤ .05); however, there were no statistically significant differences among the 3 groups at final follow-up in anterior tibial translation (P = .94), medial opening at 0° of flexion (P = .8) and 30° of flexion (P = .64), ROM (P = .39), International Knee Documentation Committee score (P = .17), Lysholm score (P = .14), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (P = .68). Three patients in group 2 had stiffness at 3 months: 2 were treated with continuous passive motion and physiotherapy, and 1 needed arthrolysis. Medial opening (at 0° and at 30°) was greater in group 3 patients with mid-substance MCL tears (P = .042 and P = .043, respectively). On minimal clinically important difference analysis, more than 80% of patients had improvement in ROM and functional scores, as well as medial opening of less than 5 mm, suggestive of successful outcomes in all 3 groups. The duration of surgery was longer in the repair group (P = .001), whereas cost was higher in the suture-tape bracing group (P = .003). Conclusions: MCL treatment with repair, isolated suture-tape-bracing, and no repair results in good radiologic outcomes (medial stress laxity) and functional outcomes when combined with ACL reconstruction. MCL repair or isolated suture-tape-bracing more effectively restores medial-sided stability. Mid-substance MCL tears may need an additional procedure (repair or bracing) to restore medial stability.

However, their effects on return-to-sport (RTS) testing are not well understood in the setting of quadriceps (Quad) or bone-tendon-bone (BTB) autograft ACLR. The purpose was to evaluate the effects of adding LEAP to Quad or BTB autograft ACLR in young athletes, with respect to formal RTS testing outcomes. We hypothesized that the addition of LEAP to Quad or BTB ACLR would result in non-inferior outcomes as compared to isolated ACLR. METHODS: A retrospective case-control analysis was performed of prospectively collected data from 93 patients under the age of 25 undergoing Quad or BTB ACLR from a single surgeon between 2021 and 2023. A control group of isolated ACLR was compared to the study group of ACLR/LEAP (either anterolateral ligament reconstruction [ALLR] or lateral extra-articular tenodesis [LET]). All patients underwent standardized RTS testing at 6 and 9 months post-surgery. The study was powered based on a priori power analysis to assess non-inferiority of the ACL/LEAP group. RESULTS: There were 51 patients (54.8%) in the isolated ACLR group and 42 (45.2%) in the ACLR/LEAP group. The ACL/LEAP group was non-inferior to the isolated ACLR group for the limb symmetry index (LSI) and passing rates for each of the 6- and 9-month RTS tests, as well as psychological readiness, as measured by Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury. There was no significant difference in overall pass rate between the control and ACL/LEAP groups (33% vs. 45.2%, respectively, p = 0.273) at 9 months. Subgroup analysis showed no differences in any outcome variables at 6 or 9 months between ACL/ALLR and ACL/LET.

The study population will consist of patients with primary ACL rupture, and high-risk individuals will be identified based on the presence of EIRTS on preoperative knee MRI. The exposure group will undergo ACLR combined with ALC augmentation, while the control group will receive standard ACLR. Observational indicators will include all baseline patient characteristics and postoperative clinical outcomes.Detailed DescriptionAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most common sports injuries in the field of sports medicine and significantly impairs athletic function. Autologous hamstring tendon single-bundle ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is the standard surgical technique for treating ACL rupture. Although most patients can return to sports postoperatively, a subset still experiences graft re-rupture, residual rotational instability of the knee, and other cases of reconstruction failure. Recent studies suggest that concomitant injury to the anterolateral complex (ALC) of the knee may be an important contributing factor. However, there is currently a lack of clinical evidence regarding the diagnosis of ALC injuries and the surgical indications for their treatment. Therefore, whether ALC should be augmented (diagnostic and surgical indications) in addition to routine ACLR, and how it should be augmented (surgical techniques), has become a key focus of current research. This project aims to establish a high-quality, large-scale, single-center bidirectional cohort study to evaluate the postoperative clinical efficacy of ACLR combined with ALC augmentation in a specific high-risk population-patients with ACL rupture exhibiting excessive internal tibial rotation subluxation (EIRTS) on preoperative MRI. The study population will consist of patients with primary ACL rupture, and high-risk individuals will be identified based on the presence of EIRTS on preoperative knee MRI. The exposure group will undergo ACLR combined with ALC augmentation, while the control group will receive standard ACLR.

Follow-up will be conducted via outpatient visits and telephone interviews. Based on the follow-up outcomes, multivariate regression models will be used to analyze the association between exposure and clinical outcomes. This cohort study aims to address treatment strategies for high-risk ACL rupture patients with preoperative EIRTS, thereby improving perioperative management and clinical decision-making in ACL injuries. It will provide important clinical evidence for establishing surgical indications for ALC augmentation and contribute to the development of long-term clinical prediction models for graft failure after ACLR. The findings will support innovation in ACL reconstruction techniques, optimization of perioperative strategies, reduction in postoperative graft failure rates, and improvement in return-to-sport rates.

METHODS: This prospective study involved 90 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendons. The patients were randomly assigned to either perform weight-bearing exercises at three weeks postoperatively (group A) or at one week postoperatively (group B). Evaluation of the patients was conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, focusing on knee range of motion, thigh circumference, and knee function assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form and Lysholm knee score. Graft evaluation was performed based on tension, tear, and synovial coverage via second-look arthroscopy at least one year after reconstruction. RESULTS: Group B exhibited significantly greater knee extension and flexion angles at 3 and 6 months compared to group A. IKDC and Lysholm scores were significantly higher in group B at 3 and 6 months. Additionally, the difference in thigh circumference between groups A and B was smaller at all evaluation periods, indicating less muscle atrophy in group B. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in synovial coverage, graft tear, or tension between the two groups based on second-look arthroscopy findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an early weight-bearing protocol leads to faster recovery of knee joint function and muscle strength, facilitating a quicker return to sports activities.

Comparison of Two Different Rehabilitation Approaches Applied After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,,,,,,6/9/2025,6/9/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2025). Date of Publication: 9 Jan 2025,clinicaltrials.gov,2025,,,,,9-Jan-25,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe anterior cruciate ligament is incumbent upon the stabilization of the knee joint in our body. Consequently, it is also of great importance for athletes since it is seen that injuries in clinics are predominantly monitored in young individuals, who do active sports. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries commonly occur in football players when a secondary task (motor or cognitive) is involved while they are busy with a motor activity. In these processes, a circumstance, in which there becomes a quick landing after a jump or a difficult pass whilst dribbling the ball, can be monitored. In such cases, the subject of preventing these injuries, which may occur in athletes, and making them ready for second tasks after the treatment of the injury, has become a current issue. It is important for individuals who have suffered the injury- to be able to bring the knee joint to its former function at the highest level after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. As a result, the development of novel rehabilitation strategies has been an ongoing focus of research. A prime exemplar of this phenomenon is the implementation of dual-task exercises. Dual-task exercises appear in athletes as motor-cognitive or motor-motor. Athletes' exercising motor-cognitive functions has attracted the attention of researchers in the past period to prevent injuries in sports and has brought a new breath to the academic world. Studies suggest a decrease in cognitive and motor functions in the acute period after injuries. However, observing its long-term effects, they also suggest an increase in the attention parameter, crucial for athletes. In a study examining postural stability in individuals, who underwent an operation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by giving motor-motor or motor-cognitive exercises, it is seen that worse results are obtained in postural stability in individuals, who underwent only anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, in cases -in which eyes were closed and dual motor tasks were given-, more negative results are obtained compared to the open-eyed group. It is associated with a significant decrease in proprioceptive performance in individuals after anterior cruciate ligament injury. Owing to this decrease, postural control decreases, and negative situations arise due to the pathology of the individual. The star balance test is a sensitive test to determine and emerges as an exercise that will correct this negative situation. Post-ACL injury, individuals exhibit significantly lower physical component scores in quality-of-life assessments compared to healthy controls, as reported in books and articles. Moreover, after the ACL reconstruction, a decrease in the mental scores of the individual is seen owing to reasons such as long-term absenteeism from work, rehabilitation, the high costs of the operation, and traumatic occasions. Foam roller, one of the current treatment modalities, is a myofascial release technique. The purpose of the foam roller application is to activate myofascial release by using the athlete's body weight and back-and-forth movement cycle. It has been observed that the usage of foam roller delays the emergence of delayed muscle soreness with myofascial release in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, while also increasing joint range of motion. Despite the widespread utilization of foam rollers in clinical practice, empirical evidence elucidating the underlying mechanisms and clinical efficacy of this modality remains relatively limited. Nevertheless, the factors -which are consequential in the return to pre-injury performance of the athletes- have not been thoroughly scrutinized. For instance, there is no encounter in the literature examining the effects of dual-task exercises on kinesiophobia, ACL-specific quality of life, star balance test evaluation, normal range of motion evaluation, Tegner-Lysholm knee scoring scale. The purpose of the study is to compare two different rehabilitation groups in terms of pain, range of motion, functionality, balance, quality of life, and kinesiophobia in individuals who underwent ACL reconstruction. The first group is the one with a dual-task approach given during walking and balance exercises together with the conventional physiotherapy program.

However, there is a lack of studies investigating the incidence of complications and lateral osteoarthritis (OA) after this procedure, and only a few studies have reported long-term results after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to compare the failure rate, clinical outcomes, and OA incidence of 3 different ACL reconstruction techniques: single-bundle quadrupled hamstring tendon (HT), bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB), and over-the-top HT plus LET (HT + LET). The authors hypothesized that the 3 techniques would have comparable clinical and radiographic outcomes at long-term follow-up. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 75 patients were included in this prospective study and randomized to undergo 1 of 3 ACL reconstruction techniques. At the last follow-up (minimum of 20 years), patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) scores, complications, and reoperations were collected, and an objective clinical evaluation was performed, including the measurement of anteroposterior (AP) laxity using an arthrometer and the quantification of the pivot shift (PS) using a triaxial accelerometer. Clinical failure was considered in patients with evidence of a graft rupture or those with a side-to-side difference in AP laxity >5 mm or with a side-to-side difference in the PS >1.5 mm/s(2). At the last follow-up, patients also underwent a radiographic evaluation to assess the incidence of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral OA. Results: PROM scores were collected from 61 patients (81%) at a mean follow-up of 23.0 ± 1.1 years. Of the 75 patients, 37 (49%) completed the clinical evaluation, and 35 (47%) had radiographs obtained. Regarding the PROMs, the HT + LET group showed a slightly higher Tegner score than the BPTB group (P =.023). All other PROM scores were not significantly different between groups. The revision and clinical failure rates were 16% and 37%, respectively, for the BPTB group, 10% and 25%, respectively, for the HT group, and 5% and 19%, respectively, for the HT + LET group, with no statistical difference between the groups. The side-to-side difference in AP laxity was lower in the BPTB group than in the HT group (P =.049). The BPTB group showed a higher patellofemoral OA rate than the HT + LET group (P =.029). There was no difference in the incidence of lateral OA between the 3 techniques. Conclusion: The 3 different surgical techniques achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes after ACL reconstruction at long-term follow-up. However, the BPTB group was associated with an increased incidence of patellofemoral OA. Also, the HT + LET group was associated with a slightly increased Tegner score at long-term follow-up, but there was no evidence of an increased risk of lateral OA for the HT + LET group.",,,,English,English,,,L2033011534,10.1177/23259671241302348,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23259671241302348,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2033011534&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=23259671&id=doi:10.1177%2F23259671241302348&atitle=Long-term+Outcomes+After+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction+With+3+Different+Surgical+Techniques%3A+A+Prospective+Randomized+Clinical+and+Radiographic+Evaluation+at+a+Minimum+of+20+Years%E2%80%99+Follow-up&stitle=Orthop.+J.+Sports+Med.&title=Orthopaedic+Journal+of+Sports+Medicine&volume=13&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Lucidi&aufirst=Gian+Andrea&auinit=G.A.&aufull=Lucidi+G.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2025&auinit1=G&auinitm=A,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

"The Effect of Cognitive-Based Neuromuscular Exercises on Reaction Time, Joint Position Sense, Proprioceptive Force Sense and Balance in Individuals Who Had Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery",,,,,,6/9/2025,6/9/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2024). Date of Publication: 18 Dec 2024,clinicaltrials.gov,2024,,,,,18-Dec-24,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe aim of this study is to investigate the effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises on increased reaction time, decreased joint position sense, reduced proprioceptive force sense, and balance problems in individuals who have undergone surgery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. With the results obtained from the study, the investigators aim to provide a different perspective on rehabilitation methods applied after ACL reconstruction and contribute to the literature with objective and evidence-based information regarding the effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises on sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and proprioceptive senses.Detailed DescriptionAnterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common knee injuries, occurring due to both contact and non-contact mechanisms, such as sudden deceleration, changes in direction, or landing after jumping, and leading to disruptions in knee stability and biomechanics. In the United States, it is estimated that there are between 100,000 and 200,000 cases annually, while the global incidence of ACL ruptures approaches 2 million cases per year. Treatment for ACL injuries can be either conservative or surgical. Conservative treatment is considered a viable option for specific populations, such as athletes who do not engage in activities requiring direction changes, individuals with no significant knee instability, and those with lower activity levels. ACL injuries result in quadriceps and hamstring weakness, reduced knee joint proprioception, and impaired balance. To restore the anatomy and biomechanics of the knee, arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is performed to stabilize the knee and prevent secondary injuries, with approximately 30,000 procedures conducted annually in the United Kingdom. Although comprehensive rehabilitation is a critical component of ACL injury management, whether treated conservatively or surgically, there is currently no gold standard rehabilitation approach for such a widespread injury. The type of rehabilitation protocol applied is one of the most significant factors influencing the outcomes of ACL reconstruction. Rehabilitation protocols have evolved substantially over the past few decades, with traditional rehabilitation, accelerated rehabilitation, and criterion-based rehabilitation protocols being the most commonly employed. These protocols aim to enhance muscle strength, improve proprioception, and ensure knee stabilization, with the timing and types of exercises determined by the biological healing and remodeling periods of the graft. Criterion-based rehabilitation protocols, a relatively new approach, aim to provide patient-specific rehabilitation and maximize progress. Developed in 2016 by the Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy (KNGF), this protocol is divided into three phases: early, mid, and late stages. To progress to the next stage, patients must meet specific goals for each phase, which are verified through objective and subjective testing. The effectiveness and quality of early and mid-stage rehabilitation significantly influence long-term outcomes. The goals of early-stage rehabilitation, lasting approximately two months, include reducing effusion, restoring joint range of motion, and minimizing muscle atrophy. During the mid-stage, which extends from the second to the sixth month, the focus shifts to achieving full control of knee extension, restoring 80% of the muscle strength in the operated limb compared to the uninjured side, and regaining jumping ability. This phase includes exercises such as knee flexor and extensor strengthening, closed kinetic chain exercises, functional exercises, balance training, plyometric exercises, and neuromuscular exercises. Neuromuscular control is essential for initiating movement and requires the integration of sensory information from proprioceptive, kinesthetic, visual, and vestibular sources, as well as cortical and spinal motor commands. This control is critical for the effective execution of movement. Recent studies indicate that ACL injuries are not isolated joint damages that merely affect stability and biomechanics but also directly influence neuromuscular control of the knee via mechanoreceptors located within the ACL. These injuries lead to neurophysiological effects on sensorimotor control. Following ACL injuries, these somatosensory changes may result in deficits in postural and motor control, leading to slower lower extremity reaction times. Additionally, nociceptive activity related to pain and swelling, combined with reduced joint position sense and kinesthesia, impairs movement quality. Neuromuscular control impairments, proprioceptive deficits, and disruptions in somatosensory inputs due to damaged mechanoreceptors may persist for 9-12 months, highlighting the need for targeted exercises during the mid-stage rehabilitation. The complex integration of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory inputs, necessary for situational awareness, enhanced alertness, and the ability to select between attentional resources, can promote the development of neurocognitive functions. Cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises aim to improve patients' reaction times, joint position sense, proprioceptive strength, and neurocognitive functions such as balance, while enhancing motor control and knee stability. An example of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises is the Life Kinetik (LK) method, developed by Lutz in Germany in 2007. This method is used to promote neural learning, support neuroplasticity, and reduce neurological symptoms. During these exercises, visual or cognitive tasks are combined with physical activity to train the brain, aiming to enhance concentration, problem-solving skills, reflexes, balance, and coordination. These exercises involve performing multiple complex tasks that require active and continuous thinking during movements. The investigators hypothesize that the complex tasks involved in these exercises may positively influence reaction time, joint position sense, proprioceptive strength, and balance, which are impaired following ACL reconstruction. A review of the literature reveals that studies examining joint position sense, neurocognitive control, and reaction time in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction are limited. Furthermore, research investigating lower extremity reaction or detection time, resulting from disrupted somatosensory inputs after ACL injuries, is also scarce. While studies have been conducted on neuromuscular exercises in ACL rehabilitation programs, no research has been identified focusing on cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises. The lack of a gold standard rehabilitation method for ACL reconstruction in the literature has driven ongoing research into new treatment modalities and their effects. Recently, cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises have emerged as a promising method to enhance cognitive abilities, joint position sense, perceptual strength, and balance. This study is designed to investigate the effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises on reaction time, joint position sense, proprioceptive force sense, and balance disorders observed in patients following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. With the results obtained from this study, the investigators aim to provide a new perspective on rehabilitation approaches in ACL reconstruction, where no gold standard treatment exists, and contribute to the literature with objective and evidence-based data regarding the effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises on sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and proprioceptive senses. Study Population and Sample The study will include individuals of both genders aged 20-40 years. Post-surgical patients will initially undergo an 8-week home-based rehabilitation program, as described by McNeil et al., with weekly monitoring to assess their progress. At the end of the 8th week, patients who meet the criteria for the early phase of a criterion-based rehabilitation approach will be included in the study. These participants will then follow an 8-week rehabilitation program, twice per week, adhering to the mid-phase criterion-based rehabilitation protocol. All rehabilitation sessions will be conducted in-person under the supervision of an experienced physiotherapist. Measurements will be performed before the rehabilitation and at the end of the 8-week program. The sample size was calculated using G\*Power 3.1, and a total of 27 participants were determined with 80% power. Data Collection Tools Demographic data, including age, gender, body weight, height, BMI, alcohol and smoking habits, injured limb, time between injury and surgery, and occupation, will be collected. Pain Measurement: Pain intensity will be assessed using the Numeric Pain Scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain). Lower Extremity Reaction Time Measurement: FITLIGHT Corp, a wireless light-sensor system, will be used to measure reaction time. Participants will deactivate randomly lit sensors using the affected and unaffected lower extremities. Task variations will include cognitive dual tasks (e.g., counting backward by fives) and motor dual tasks (e.g., tossing and catching a ball) to assess dual-task performance. Joint Position Sense: Passive joint position sense will be evaluated using a joint repositioning task at 15° and 45° knee flexion, with measurements taken using the ""Clinometer"" smartphone application. Cognitive and motor tasks will also be incorporated. Proprioceptive Force Sense: Proprioceptive force sense will be assessed using the StabilizerTM biofeedback device. Participants will perform isometric contractions, and differences between targeted and actual force values will be recorded. Cognitive and motor dual tasks will also be included. Static Balance Test: Single-leg stance tests will evaluate static balance under open-eye conditions. Dual-task conditions will include verbal tasks (e.g., naming words starting with specific letters) and motor tasks (e.g., holding a tray with a cup of water). Activity Level: Pre-injury activity levels will be measured using the Tegner Activity Scale, which scores activity from 0 (no activity) to 10 (elite-level competition). IKDC Subjective Knee Form: Knee symptoms, function, and activity levels will be evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function. Treatment Protocol Participants meeting progression criteria will undergo an 8-week mid-phase rehabilitation program (twice weekly). Patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1: Exercises performed without secondary tasks. Group 2: Exercises performed with cognitive or motor dual tasks (e.g., rhythmic counting, reverse spelling, ball manipulation). Example Exercises (Weeks 8-16): Quadriceps and hamstring strengthening exercises, Hip, lumbo-pelvic, and gastrocnemius-soleus strengthening, Closed kinetic chain exercises, Functional exercises (e.g., squats, lunges, leg press), Balance training (e.g., tandem walking, single-leg stance with open and closed eyes). Exercises will include 8-12 repetitions across 3 sets, ensuring optimal loading without over-stressing healing tissues. Pain and swelling will be closely monitored, with exercise intensity adjusted as necessary. Resistance will start at 40-50% of the unaffected limb's capacity and progress to 70-80%, depending on the patient's functional status.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06755398,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06755398,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06755398&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

"Comparison of Conservative Treatment With Blood Flow Restriction With Standard Management in Total ACL Rupture. ""Randomized Clinical Trial""",,,,,,6/9/2025,6/9/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2024). Date of Publication: 30 Nov 2024,clinicaltrials.gov,2024,,,,,30-Nov-24,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe goal of this randomised clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR) in patients with a complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. The main questions it aims to answer are: 1. Does blood flow restriction adds any additional benefits to conservative treatment of the ACL? 2. Does bracing promotes spontaneous healing to the ACL Researchers will compare bracing and BFR to bracing and sham BFR to see if the intervention provides any additional benefits to the conservative management of this injury. Participants will: 1. Use a knee brace for 6 weeks with adjustments according to protocol 2. Follow and identical exercise plan with either BFR (intervention group) or BFR sham (control group) 3. Follow a home based exercise program.Detailed DescriptionMethodological design: For the purposes of the present study, a double-blind, two-arm randomised clinical trial will be conducted. Participants in the intervention group will undergo and exercise protocol with the use of blood flow restriction (BFR). Participants in control group will follow the same exercise protocol but with sham BFR instead. Both groups will follow the same brace protocol. Intervention group: The intervention group will consist of people with a recent ACL tear who meet the eligibility criteria. Participants in this group will follow a splint use protocol. In particular, during the first 3 weeks (phase 1) a splint will be used with the knee immobilised at 90°, non-weight bearing walking with the use of walking aids according to age and mobility. During the 4th and 5th week (phase 2) the range of motion of the splint will be set to 60° to 90° and from 30° to 90° respectively. Walking will remain non-weight bearing. During the 6th week (phase 3) the degree of freedom of the splint will be placed at 0° allowing full flexion but preventing hyperextension of the joint. During this phase, partial bearing is allowed with the use of a walking aid. From the 7th week (phase 4) onwards the splint is removed and walking is done with no loading restrictions. Regarding the exercise program, participants in this group, during phase 1, will perform isometric quadriceps and hamstring contractions guided by a visual stimulus from an electronic hand dynamometer. The exercise parameters will be 75 repetitions divided into 4 sets (30,15,15,15) at 30% of the 1st maximum of the opposite leg. During phase 2, the exercise protocol is maintained as phase 1 with the only differences that the exercises will be performed at 60 degrees too. Additionally, the ""sliding"" exercise will be added where the heel is dragged on the bed causing knee flexion as well as the skateboard sliding exercise from a seated position in the allowed range of motion. Exercise parameters remain the same for all exercises as previous phase. In the 3rd phase, single leg squats up to 45° are added. Exercise parameters remain the same. In the 4th phase, the exercise protocol changes. Subjects start at a stationary bike for 5 minutes (without BFR) and the quadriceps and hamstrings isometrics are replaced with resistance exercises for extension and knee flexion. Sliding and single-leg squats are performed at an increased range of flexion (up to 90°) and climbing a 30cm step is added. All exercise parameters remain the same as in the previous phases. During the last phase (5th) gait retraining on a treadmill for 5 minutes and Y balance exercise is added. Both of these exercises will be performed without BFR. The break between sets will be 30 seconds and between exercises 1 minute. The exercise program of the intervention group will be performed under lower extremity blood flow restriction. Cuff pressure will be reduced during the breaks. The execution speed of the exercises will be 2 seconds of contraction followed by 2 seconds of return. Hold in all isometric exercises will be 3 seconds. Initial measurements will be taken upon enrollment of participants and will include MRI, Lachman test, arthrometer, strength, swelling, Lysholm scale, Tegner scale, pain (Vas), exercise pain (Vas). By the end of 2nd and 4th week, strength, swelling and pain (Vas) will be reassessed. The final measurements will be taken at the end of the intervention period and will include all the measurements taken initially. The participants will be given a home-base exercise program through an electronic platform which will provide the possibility of monitoring their compliance. At the same time, through the platform, the correct execution of the exercises will be ensured as all the exercises will be presented with videos and specific exercise parameters. Control Group: The control group will perform an identical program of splinting, exercises, home exercises and measurements as the intervention group. The blood flow restriction protocol will be performed in an identical manner to the intervention group, with only difference being that variables setting will be set at a control program (sham).",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06727344,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06727344,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06727344&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Short-term and midterm studies show little or no differences between the 2 grafts; however, there are only a few long-term studies to compare results between the 2 grafts. PURPOSE: To compare the results after using either BPTB grafts or hamstring tendon grafts 18 years after ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence 2. METHODS: A total of 114 patients with ACL rupture between 2001 and 2004 were randomized to reconstruction with either a BPTB graft or a hamstring tendon graft. Patients were operated on at 4 major hospitals. The 18-year follow-up evaluation included anterior knee laxity measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer, defined as the primary outcome, while clinical examination (Lachman and pivot-shift tests), isokinetic testing of muscle strength, patient-reported outcome measures, and an assessment of radiographic osteoarthritis using the Kellgren-Lawrence classification were defined as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 96 patients (84%, 47 BPTB and 49 hamstring grafts) were available for follow-up, 71 of these for clinical examination. Seven of 96 patients were excluded for ACL revision (n = 5) or knee replacement (n = 2) surgery. In total, 25 patients (10 BPTB and 15 hamstring grafts) had undergone additional surgery other than ACL revision or total knee arthroplasty. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of anterior laxity test with KT-1000 arthrometer (primary outcome). In secondary outcomes, no significant differences between groups were reported regarding clinical examination, patient-reported outcome scores, or radiographic osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2-4 for patellofemoral joint [18 hamstring and 14 BPTB] or tibiofemoral joint [20 hamstring and 19 BPTB]), while isokinetic testing revealed that the hamstring group had a 10.7% reduction in mean peak flexion torque compared with the BPTB group at 60 deg/s (df = 59; P = .011). At 60 deg/s the mean total flexion work in the hamstring group was reduced by 17.2% compared with the BPTB group (df = 59; P = .002). CONCLUSION: The flexion strength in the hamstring group was significantly reduced in the operated knee after 18 years. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding subjective outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, range of motion, clinical and instrumented knee laxity, and the development of osteoarthritis.

In the tendon-sparing all-inside technique, a quadrupled semitendinosus graft and adjustable-loop cortical fixation are suggested to give less postoperative flexion deficits while displaying overall similar clinical results to the traditional hamstring technique. However, there are a limited number of high-quality studies comparing these techniques with inconsistent results. PURPOSE: To investigate differences between the all-inside (quadrupled semitendinosus) and traditional hamstring (double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis) technique regarding (1) self-reported function, (2) hamstring strength, and (3) knee laxity. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A total of 98 patients were randomized to either the all-inside or the traditional hamstring technique. Perioperatively, duration of surgery and graft size were obtained. The International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjective Knee Form score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Tegner Activity Scale score, knee laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference and pivot shift), range of motion, isokinetic knee strength, and hop test score were collected preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. Return-to-sport readiness was evaluated 9 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients completed 2-year follow-up, 45 patients with the all-inside technique and 44 patients with the traditional hamstring technique. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the outcome measures 2 years after surgery, but there was a tendency in the all-inside group toward having increased anterior translation (mean, 3.6 mm vs 2.7 mm), a higher number of revision surgeries (5 patients vs 2 patients), and more patients having +1 and +2 pivot-shift values (29 vs 18 patients) when compared with the traditional group. CONCLUSION: The all-inside technique yields equivalent results to the traditional hamstring technique 2 years after surgery and should be considered a reliable technique to use for ACL reconstruction. Sparing the gracilis tendon does not lead to less persistent hamstring weakness. Long-term follow-up is needed to further determine whether the tendency of increased anterior translation seen at 2 years postoperatively will lead to a higher risk of graft failure.",,,,English,English,,38845474,L644457447,10.1177/03635465241254048,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03635465241254048,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L644457447&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F03635465241254048&atitle=ACL+Reconstruction+Using+Quadrupled+Semitendinosus+Versus+Double-Stranded+Semitendinosus+and+Gracilis+Autograft%3A+2-Year+Results+From+a+Prospective+Randomized+Controlled+Study&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=52&issue=8&spage=1927&epage=1936&aulast=Mo&aufirst=Ingunn+Fleten&auinit=I.F.&aufull=Mo+I.F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1927-1936&date=2024&auinit1=I&auinitm=F,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"
Combined Intra- and Extra-articular ACL Reconstruction Versus Isolated Intra-articular ACL Reconstruction: Prospective Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial With Hamstring Autograft,,,,,,5/19/2025,5/19/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2024). Date of Publication: 3 Jun 2024,clinicaltrials.gov,2024,,,,,3-Jun-24,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAbstract Introduction: Autologous hamstring tendons are the most commonly used grafts in ACL reconstruction worldwide. There are several ways to prepare the graft using these tendons. One can prioritize increasing the diameter of an isolated intra-articular graft or alternatively, using one graft limb as an extra-articular reinforcement via the anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction, with both options aiming to reduce the re-rupture rate relative to traditional quadrupled hamstring grafts. Objective: To compare, through a prospective and randomized clinical trial, intra and extra-articular ACL reconstruction with ALL using hamstring autograft versus isolated anatomical ACL reconstruction using quintuple or sextuple hamstring autograft. Methods: 146 patients will be randomized into two groups of 73 patients. Patients included in the study will be evaluated preoperatively and after surgery at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The primary outcomes will be clinical failure rate and graft rerupture rate. Secondary outcomes will include functional capacity assessed through IKDC, Lysholm KOOS, and Tegner scores, pain using the VAS, as well as stability assessed by digital rolimeter and objective IKDC. Kinesiophobia and anxiety will be measured using the Tampa scale and Anxiety and Depression scale. Keywords: Rupture, Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Anterior Cruciate Ligament ReconstructionDetailed Description1. Introduction Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a well-established procedure known for its superiority over non-surgical treatment of this injury. However, failure rates following ACL reconstruction can vary from 3-6% in some patient cohorts up to 40% in patients at increased risk of re-injury Hamstring autograft are the most commonly used for ACL reconstruction. Considering that the final graft diameter inferior to 8mm is associated to increased failure rate, and that increased intra-articular diameter is considered a protective factor, the preparation of hamstring autografts influences the final outcome. Historically used quadrupled hamstring grafts have been progressively replaced in recent years by quintupled or sextupled graft configurations in order to increase final graft diameter. However, instead of using configurations that prioritize increasing the final diameter of hamstring autografts, ACL reconstruction associated with extra-articular reconstruction of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be performed using a portion of the gracilis, prioritizing the reconstruction of the ALL rather than increasing the intra-articular graft diameter. The association of the ALL serves two main functions: to decrease rotational instability, which can reach up to 40% in high-risk patients, and to mechanically protect the graft. In a comparative analysis pairing patients with similar characteristics, ACL + ALL reconstruction showed significantly lower rerupture rate compared to isolated ACL reconstruction: 3.5% versus 17.4%. In another comparative analysis also pairing patients for similarity, isolated ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autograft showed a 3x higher risk of rerupture compared to ACL + ALL reconstruction with hamstring autografts. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that extra-articular reinforcement with ALL reconstruction associated with anatomical ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft may improve knee stability and help reduce the re-injury rate compared to isolated anatomical reconstruction with quintuple or sextuple hamstrings that prioritize graft diameter, following a well-defined criterion of indication for patients at increased risk of re-injury. In this way, the investigators intend to compare two methods through a randomized clinical trial: intra- and extra-articular reconstruction of the ACL with ALL with hamstring autograft versus isolated anatomical reconstruction of the ACL with quintuple or sextuple hamstring autograft. 2. Hypothesis Anatomical ACL reconstruction associated with extra-articular ALL reconstruction with hamstring autograft will present better functional results, better stability, lower clinical failure rate, and lower graft rupture rate when compared to isolated intra-articular anatomical ACL reconstruction with quintuple or sextuple hamstring autograft. 3. Objectives To compare the functional results, stability, clinical failure rate, and graft rupture rate of individuals undergoing anatomical ACL reconstruction associated with extra-articular ALL reconstruction with hamstring autograft compared to isolated intra-articular anatomical ACL reconstruction with quintuple or sextuple hamstring autograft. 4. Group Formation and Intervention Description After randomization, two groups will be formed: Group A: Anatomic ACL Reconstruction combined with Extra-Articular Reconstruction with Anterolateral Ligament. The single gracilis strand ALL graft will be passed deep to the iliotibial tract (and superficial to the lateral collateral ligament), entering the tibial tunnel from proximal to distal with its Ethibond terminal portion tied to the tibial terminal portion of the ACL Ethibond with the knee in extension and neutral rotation - without added fixation devices. Wound closure in a layered fashion concludes the procedure. Group B: Isolated Intra-Articular Anatomic ACL Reconstruction 5. Patient Evaluation Patients included in the study will be evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months. 6. Return to Sport Criteria All patients will be advised to return to sport only after meeting the following criteria: full range of motion, absence of moderate or severe pain, absence of clinical failure criteria, a minimum of 9 months post-operative period, and completion of FIFA 11+ training for prevention for at least 3 months. 7. Strategies to Improve Adherence and Monitoring Utilization of the Maia Health Tech platform (São Paulo, SP, Brazil), a mobile data collection system with cloud storage and LGPD protection with data anonymization, also using WhatsApp for messaging. Pre-scheduled messages according to the evaluation timeline will assist in patient adherence and monitoring. 8. Circumstances Allowing the Termination of Blinding with Group Revelation Since blinding will occur only for the statistician and partially for data recorders, it will exceptionally be necessary to terminate the blinding. 9. Data Collection Part of the data will be collected in person by people who will have access to knowledge of which group each patient is in. Data will be recorded on the RedCap platform (Vanderbilt, Tennessee). Part of the data will be collected remotely, with blinding, using the Maia Health Tech Platform (São Paulo, SP, Brazil), a mobile data collection system with cloud storage and HIPAA-compliant protection with data anonymization, also using WhatsApp for messaging, which will send the following questionnaires to patients: IKDC, Lysholm, KOOS, Tegner, and VAS. One of the investigators will send the patients' phone numbers to the platform so that it can send the data to be collected via WhatsApp through the patient's number. This data will be sent by the Maia Health Tech platform to the RedCap platform autonomously and pre-programmed, without anyone involved in the study intermediating. To reduce patient loss during follow-up, the current phone number of the patient, and the phone numbers of two additional close contacts will be collected in case the patient changes their number. The patient will also be instructed to inform the investigator responsible for registering the phone numbers of patients, as well as the Maia Health Tech platform, of any number changes. The collected data will be submitted to the RedCap platform. Only the investigators Marcos Vinicius Credidio, Enzo Salviato Mameri, and Thiago Bueno Sanchez will have access to this platform. On the RedCap platform, the name, ID, and date of birth of each patient will be included to avoid duplication of records. 10. Statistics A priori Power Analysis - Sample Calculation For the sample size calculation, the G\*Power 3.1.9.7 program (http://www.gpower.hhu.de/) was used. To compare if there is a difference in the frequencies of variables related to ACL graft rupture rate and clinical failure rate (dichotomous categorical variables) between the two groups of interest, the Chi-Square test was used. For this contingency table, the statistical power calculation considered the following criteria: significance level α of 5%, effect size of 25%, and degree of freedom (df) equal to 1. In a contingency table, the df is calculated as follows: (number of rows - 1) x (number of columns - 1). Considering that the study has two groups and that the variables related to the ACL graft rupture rate and clinical failure rate are dichotomous categorical variables, the calculated degree of freedom was 1. Thus, the sample size calculated for these analyses was 126 individuals. Anticipating a 15% loss of patients during follow-up, 145 patients will be needed to evaluate the graft rupture rate and clinical failure rate as primary outcomes. To compare if there is a functional difference through the scores obtained from the IKDC, Lysholm, and KOOS questionnaires (numerical variables) between the two study groups using the t-Student test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric), using a significance level α of 5%, type β error probability of 20%, an observed power of 80% (1-β), and an effect size of 25%, the total calculated sample size was 506 patients. Anticipating a 15% loss of patients during follow-up, 581 patients will be needed to evaluate functional differences, initially considered secondary outcomes. 11. Statistical Analysis The analysis of quantitative variables will be performed with the calculation of mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval for each estimated point. Secondary variables (categories) will be analyzed through absolute and relative frequency with a 95% confidence interval calculation. Data will be presented in bar graphs and tables for sample characteristics. 12. Interim Analysis and Guidelines for Study Termination A partial analysis will be performed halfway through recruitment with a minimum follow-up of 12 months, and the study will be interrupted if a 30% difference in the primary outcome is observed. The partial analysis will be conducted by a statistician not directly involved in the study, and the decision to terminate the study based on the above criteria will be made by the lead researcher. 13. General, Local Risks, and Adverse Effects The main risks, regardless of the surgical technique used, are as follows: anesthetic risk (e.g., inadvertent punctures, bleeding in venous or spinal anesthesia access, post-spinal anesthesia headache, urinary retention), surgical site infection, swelling and bruising in the knee joint, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, neurovascular injuries, unsatisfactory results, and even death (a very rare occurrence but possible in any surgical or anesthetic procedure). The postoperative period presents situations of discomfort inherent to the recovery and rehabilitation of the research participant. Adverse effects will be considered any undesirable medical events that the study participant experiences. Range of motion will be evaluated with a goniometer to analyze its loss, and any other signs of clinical problems such as persistent effusion, surgical wound complications, and thrombosis will be documented. Serious adverse effects will be considered: unexpected surgical or medication effects resulting in death, life-threatening conditions, requiring hospitalization, resulting in permanent disability, or necessitating surgical intervention for resolution. 14. Benefits for the Patient The benefits to the participant, regardless of the surgical technique used, which are well-established in the literature and routinely performed by the interventionists, include the potential for improved function and reduced pain in the affected limb. Additionally, patients will undergo physical therapy rehabilitation and receive the necessary analgesic support for comfort and well-being. There will be no financial benefit for the patient. 15. Study Justification The study aims to elucidate the best method for preparing hamstring autograft grafts for ACL reconstruction using the same amount of implants in both studied techniques. As these tendons are the most commonly used grafts for ACL reconstruction worldwide, the study's results are expected to have a significant impact on the scientific community, aiding in the better treatment choice for patients. 16. Funding The study will be self-funded.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06505525,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06505525,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06505525&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

PURPOSE: To investigate patient outcomes in patients undergoing HT versus QT ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: After recruitment and randomization, 112 patients (HT = 55; QT = 57) underwent ACLR. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively (6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months), with a range of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), graft laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer; primary outcome variable), active knee flexion and extension range of motion (ROM), peak isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength, and a 6-hop performance battery. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated for strength and hop measures. Secondary procedures, ACL retears, and contralateral ACL tears were reported. RESULTS: All PROMs and knee ROM measures significantly improved (P < .0001), and no other group differences (P > .05) were observed-apart from the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) score, which was significantly better in the HT group at 3 (P = .008), 6 (P = .010), and 12 (P = .014) months. No significant changes were observed in side-to-side laxity from 6 to 24 months (P = .105), and no group differences were observed (P = .487) at 6 (HT mean, 1.2; QT mean, 1.3), 12 (HT mean, 1.1; QT mean, 1.3), and 24 (HT mean, 1.1; QT mean, 1.2) months. While the HT group demonstrated significantly greater (P < .05) quadriceps strength LSIs at 6 and 12 months, the QT group showed significantly greater (P < .05) hamstring strength LSIs at 6, 12, and 24 months. The HT group showed significantly greater (P < .05) LSIs for the single horizontal (6 months), lateral (6 and 12 months), and medial (6 months) hop tests for distance.

Secondary procedures included 5 in the HT group (manipulation under anesthesia, notch debridement, meniscal repair, and knee arthroscopy for scar tissue) and 6 in the QT group (notch debridement, meniscal repair, knee arthroscopy for scar tissue, tibial tubercle transfer, and osteochondral autologous transplantation). CONCLUSION: Apart from the ACL-RSI, the 2 autograft groups compared well for PROMs, knee ROM, and laxity. However, greater hamstring strength LSIs were observed for the QT cohort, with greater quadriceps strength (and hop test) LSIs in the HT cohort. The longer-term review will continue to evaluate return to sports and later-stage reinjury between the 2 graft constructs.

The Efficacy of Intra-articular Tranexamic Acid Injection With Different Drainage Clamping Time in Postoperative Bleeding and Pain After Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,,,,,,6/5/2025,6/5/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2024). Date of Publication: 20 Feb 2024,clinicaltrials.gov,2024,,,,,20-Feb-24,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryPost-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) hemarthrosis may result in increased pain thus delaying postoperative rehabilitation, which may eventually lead to arthrofibrosis and a functional deficit. Many antifibrinolytic agents, including tranexamic acid (TXA), have been used in orthopedic surgeries to reduce postoperative bleeding. Moreover, TXA was proved effective to reduced the events of hemarthrosis and increased the post-operative functional outcomes of the patients in several studies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intra-articular injection of TXA with different drainage clamping time in patients receiving arthroscopic ACLRs. Patients were randomized into four groups. An intra-articular suction drain was placed recorded 24 h postoperatively. Group 1 patients(TXA 4hr group) received the index procedures with a 10 mL intra-articular injection of TXA and following drainage clamped 4 hours. Group 2 patients(TXA 8hr group) received the index procedures with a 10 mL intra-articular injection of TXA and following drainage clamped 8 hours. Clinical evaluations using an IKDC functional score and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score were performed during admission, at postoperative day 3 and week 4.Detailed DescriptionSurgical technique All patients participating in this study received surgery by the same surgeon (H.L.M.) with spinal anesthesia. Pneumatic tourniquet was routinely utilized during the procedure. A 3-cm incision was made over the medial proximal tibia to harvest the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons from the distal insertion. The tendons were quadrupled and whipstitched with No. 2 and No. 5 Ethibond sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) as previously described.12 The folded tendons' diameters were measured using sizing cylinders with 0.5 mm incremental changes in size. The femoral sockets were created by drilling from the insertion site at the lateral femoral condyle through the anteromedial portal. The tibial tunnel was drilled with an Acufex guide (Smith \& Nephew, Andover, MA). The diameters of the sockets were matched to the size of the folded graft. The grafts were fixed with bioscrews (BioRCI-HA; Smith \& Nephew) at the femoral site and at the tibial site with the knee flexed at 30°. The screw and tunnel sizes were identical. Following the procedure, a Hemovac suction drain (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) was placed at the superior-lateral aspect of the joint. Additionally, in the TXA group, 10 mL of TXA solution (100 mg/mL; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the joint, and all closed suction drains were clamped for 4, or 8 hours based on the grouping results. Clinical evaluation Postoperative drainage output is the primary outcome of this study. The drain tubes were routinely removed postoperatively once the volume of drainage decreased, of which the total volume was recorded. The secondary outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) functional score. The former was documented immediately after patients were transferred back to the ward from the post-anesthesia recovery room, on day 3 and at week 4 after surgery. Besides, the maximum of postoperative VAS score during admission was also documented. IKDC functional score was a subjective questionnaire including three categories with symptoms, athletic activity, and knee function. Higher score indicated better function with highest score of 10 and lowest of 0. All the objective measurements followed at postoperative 4 week were evaluated by an independent observer who was blinded to this study at the outpatient clinic. Statical analysis The power calculation was calculated using the G\*Power software (version 3.1; Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany). The volume of drainage between groups from our previous study was used as the primary variable. With a power of 0.8 and a significance level of .05, a total of 49 patients were required for each group. Oversampling of patients in each group was performed due to potential withdrawals and losses to follow-up. All data are expressed as mean and 95% confidence interval or standard deviation. The amounts of drainage and the functional scores were compared among four groups with Analysis of Variance(ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 22.0, IBM, Armonk, NY). Differences were considered significant at P \< 0.05.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06280456,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06280456,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06280456&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Saunders,"Purpose: To determine whether the addition of lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) to anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) would improve return-to-sport (RTS) rates in young, active patients who play high-risk sports. Methods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial compared standard hamstring tendon ACLR with combined ACLR and LET using a strip of the iliotibial band (modified Lemaire technique). Patients aged 25 years or younger with an anterior cruciate ligament–deficient knee were included. Patients also had to meet 2 of the following criteria: (1) pivot-shift grade 2 or greater, (2) participation in a high-risk or pivoting sport, and (3) generalized ligamentous laxity. Time to return and level of RTS were determined via administration of a questionnaire at 24 months postoperatively. Results: We randomized 618 patients in this study, 553 of whom played high-risk sports preoperatively. The proportion of patients who did not RTS was similar between the ACLR (11%) and ACLR-LET (14%) groups; however, the graft rupture rate was significantly different (11.2% in ACLR group vs 4.1% in ACLR-LET group, P =.004). The most cited reason for no RTS was lack of confidence and/or fear of reinjury. A stable knee was associated with nearly 2 times greater odds of returning to a high-level high-risk sport postoperatively (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-3.35; P =.02). There were no significant differences in patient-reported functional outcomes or hop test results between groups (P >.05). Patients who returned to high-risk sports had better hamstring symmetry than those who did not RTS (P =.001). Conclusions: At 24 months postoperatively, patients who underwent ACLR plus LET had a similar RTS rate to those who underwent ACLR alone. Although the subgroup analysis did not show a statistically significant increase in RTS with the addition of LET, on returning, the addition of LET kept subjects playing longer by reducing graft failure rates.

However, the ideal graft source is still debatable. This study compared hamstring (HT) and bone-free quadriceps (QT) tendon autografts in terms of muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes. Methods: Between June 2018 and December 2019, 46 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of two groups for the ACL reconstruction surgery—the HT autograft group or the QT autograft group. An experienced examiner performed preoperative and postoperative examinations. The HUMAC NORM isokinetic machine (Computer Sports Medicine International-CSMI, 2004) was used to assess flexor and extensor thigh muscle strength. Both groups received the same surgical technique and fixation method. All patients were examined after three, six, nine, and 12 months. The final evaluations were performed at the 24-month follow-up. Patients’ scores on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form and the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale were used to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. The two groups were also compared in terms of postoperative complications and activity levels. Results: The difference between preoperative and postoperative knee flexor peak torques (FPT) was lower in the QT group than in the HT group. The average difference between preoperative and postoperative knee extensor peak torque (EPT) was higher in the QT group than in the HT group. As a result, the HT group had a lower postoperative H/Q ratio (flexor strength normalized to body mass divided by extensor strength normalized to body mass) than the QT group (p < 0.001). The mean IKDC scores for the HT and QT groups were 90.13 ± 6.99 and 87.12 ± 6.61, respectively. The scores of the two groups postoperatively were close, and both groups showed significant improvement. The average graft size in the QT group was significantly greater than that in the HT group. Saphenous nerve palsy was the most common complication in the HT group (22%). Thigh hematomas were observed in two patients in the QT group and required urgent intervention (12%). Conclusion: After ACL reconstruction, we found a significant decrease in strength at the donor sites in both techniques, with similar patient-reported measures and stability outcomes. The H/Q strength ratio was higher in the QT group postoperatively, which may have a protective effect on the reconstructed ligament.

Recent interest has focused on the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) as a potential alternative to hamstring tendons (HT) due to its biomechanical properties and potential advantages. However, comparative studies assessing functional outcomes between PLT and HT in ACLR are lacking. We conducted a cross‐sectional study involving 60 ACL injury cases treated with ACL reconstruction using either hamstring or peroneus longus tendon grafts. Patient selection was randomized, and assessments included preoperative planning, surgery under spinal or combined spinal‐epidural anesthesia, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols. Functional scores were assessed using the Lysholm Knee Score and IKDC Score at various follow‐up intervals. Both groups showed favorable outcomes in terms of knee stability and functional scores. There were no statistically significant differences in Lysholm and IKDC scores between the two groups at any time point during the follow‐up period. Additionally, postoperative complications did not significantly differ between the groups. The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autografts yields comparable outcomes to hamstring tendon autografts in terms of knee stability and functional scores. The use of peroneus longus tendon grafts may offer advantages such as larger size, satisfactory ankle function preservation and avoidance of potential complications associated with hamstring graft harvesting. Thus, peroneus longus tendon autografts could be considered a safe and viable option for ACL reconstruction, particularly in specific patient populations showing a preference for this approach.",,,,English,English,,,L2035509225,10.59218/makrjms.2024.3.254.259,http://dx.doi.org/10.59218/makrjms.2024.3.254.259,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2035509225&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=19936095&id=doi:10.59218%2Fmakrjms.2024.3.254.259&atitle=Comparative+Study+Between+Functional+Outcome+of+Knee+with+ACL+Recontruction+Using+Hamstring+Graft+vs+Peroneus+longus+Graft&stitle=Res.+J.+Med.+Sci.&title=Research+Journal+of+Medical+Sciences&volume=18&issue=3&spage=254&epage=259&aulast=Siddique&aufirst=Mohammed+Sohail&auinit=M.S.&aufull=Siddique+M.S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=254-259&date=2024&auinit1=M&auinitm=S,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Psychological factors related to kinesiophobia, confidence, and psychological readiness are associated with second ACL injury; however, the evidence is conflicting. HYPOTHESIS: Athletes who sustain a second ACL injury (ie, graft rupture or contralateral ACL rupture) within 2 years of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) would have greater kinesiophobia, less confidence, and lower psychological readiness prior to return to sport (RTS) compared with athletes who do not sustain a second ACL injury. STUDY DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective randomized trial.Level 3. METHODS: A total of 39 female Level I/II athletes completed the following measures after postoperative rehabilitation and a 10-session RTS and second ACL injury prevention program: ACL Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale, the 11-item Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-11), and question 3 on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) quality of life (QoL) subscale. Athletes were dichotomized based on whether they sustained a second ACL injury within 2 years of ACLR or not. Independent t tests determined group differences in TSK-11, KOOS-QoL, ACL-RSI, and the 3 individual components of the ACL-RSI (ie, emotions, confidence, risk appraisal). RESULTS: Nine athletes sustained a second ACL injury (4 graft ruptures and 5 contralateral ACL ruptures). The group that sustained a second ACL injury had higher scores on the ACL-RSI (P = 0.03), higher on the risk appraisal questions of the ACL-RSI (P < 0.01), and met RTS criteria sooner than athletes who did not (P = 0.04). All second ACL injuries occurred in athletes who underwent primary ACLR with hamstring tendon autografts. CONCLUSION: Athletes who sustained a second ACL within 2 years of ACLR had a more positive psychological outlook, higher scores on the specific questions related to the risk appraisal construct of the ACL-RSI, and met RTS criteria sooner than athletes who did not sustain a second ACL injury.

METHODS: A total of 70 patients (10 IIIM, 17 IIIL, and 43 IV) with knee dislocation were randomly divided into the remnant-preserved group and the simple reconstruction group. Patients underwent two-stage reconstruction, including the reconstruction of collateral ligament in phase I and the reconstruction of ACL/PCL in phase II (12 weeks after phase I). Grafts were harvested from the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons from both lower limbs. After the surgery, the joint flexion and extension, bone tunnel and ligament healing, and joint stability were evaluated. RESULTS: After the surgery, the lateral stability recovered in all patients, and X-ray revealed a good position of bone tunnel. Follow-up was performed at 12 months postoperatively and ranged from 24 to 91 months. At the final follow-up, knee flexion angle, IKDC, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were all higher in both groups compared to the preoperative period.

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied.Methods:Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared.Results:The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up.Conclusions:PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level II.

ARAVET : Antero-lateral Ligament Reconstruction Versus Modified Lemaire's Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis in Combination With ACL Reconstruction With a Minimum Follow up of 2 Years: a Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,5/12/2025,5/12/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2023). Date of Publication: 17 Nov 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,17-Nov-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are associated with concomitant lesions of the anterolateral ligament (ALL), which increase rotatory instability of the knee. If untreated, ALL insufficiency can compromise the results of ACL reconstruction, with higher risk of iterative ACL tear or additional meniscal lesion. Several surgical techniques have been described to reconstruct the ALL. Indications are increasingly frequent and actually, consensus being young patients, patients practising pivot sports, significant rotational laxity on clinical examination with a positive pivot shift test, or in cases of iterative surgery. To date, the two most popular techniques are the Lemaire technique (use of a fascia lata strip) and LAL reconstruction plasty (use of part of an accessory hamstring tendon). The older Lemaire procedure, popularized in the 1980s has proved its efficiency in terms of biomechanics, safety and reproducibility. More recently, following a new, precise anatomical description, anterolateral ligament plasty (ALL) has been developed, which is intended to be more anatomical than Lemaire's technique, but whose clinical superiority has not yet been demonstrated. Both techniques are currently used in our department, with the choice of technique left to the surgeon's discretion. To date, no randomized prospective study has demonstrated the clinical superiority of one technique over the other with a long term follow up. The aim of this study was to compare graft survival of ALL reconstruction versus modified Lemaire LET in combination with ACL reconstruction with a minimum follow up of 2 years. Secondary aim was to compare functional outcomes between both groups.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06147427,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06147427,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06147427&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Whether graft maturation and incorporation can be improved with the use of a scaffold requires investigation. Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of wrapping an ACL autograft with an amnion collagen matrix and injecting bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), quantify the cellular content of the BMAC samples, and assess 2-year postoperative patient-reported outcomes. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 40 patients aged 18 to 35 years who were scheduled to undergo ACLR were enrolled in a prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial with 2 arms based on graft type: bone–patellar tendon–bone (BTB; n = 20) or hamstring (HS; n = 20). Participants in each arm were randomized into a control group who underwent standard ACLR or an intervention group who had their grafts wrapped with an amnion collagen matrix during graft preparation, after which BMAC was injected under the wrap layers after implantation. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mapping/processing yielded mean T2* relaxation time and graft volume values at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Participants completed the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation Score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and pain visual analog scale. Statistical linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify the effects over time and the differences between the control and intervention groups. Adverse events were also recorded. Results: No significant differences were found at any time point between the intervention and control groups for BTB T2* (95% CI, –1.89 to 0.63; P =.31), BTB graft volume (95% CI, –606 to 876.1; P =.71), HS T2* (95% CI, –2.17 to 0.39; P =.162), or HS graft volume (95% CI, –11,141.1 to 351.5; P =.28). No significant differences were observed between the intervention and control groups of either graft type on any patient-reported outcome measure. No adverse events were reported after a 2-year follow-up. Conclusion: In this pilot study, wrapping a graft with an amnion collagen matrix and injecting BMAC appeared safe. MRI T2* values and graft volume of the augmented ACL graft were not significantly different from that of controls, suggesting that the intervention did not result in improved graft maturation.

Methods: A total of 80 patients with a complete ACL tear who underwent arthroscopic reconstruction with autologous tendon transplantation (semitendinosus-gracilis tendon) were included in this study. The patients were admitted to our hospital between March 2020 and January 2022 and were randomly divided into two groups: the conventional group (n = 40) and the personalized guide group (n = 40), based on the positioning method. The conventional group underwent ACL restoration using standard surgical techniques, while the personalized guide group opted for the more precise computer-assisted personalized guide method.

Date of Publication: 16 Sep 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,16-Sep-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of Vancomycin versus Gentamycin , in reducing infection rates following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction .Detailed DescriptionThere has been a marked increase in the number of cases of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) worldwide. ACLR helps in the restoration of knee instability. But infection following ACLR is a big complication(1) .It may require multiple reoperations in the form of irrigation and debridement, prolonged use of antibiotics, removal of the graft, and sometimes graft revision surgery. It also has increases the risk of early osteoarthritis, and causes graft failure (2,3) . There are a number of contributing factors that can lead to infection, like the presence of comorbid conditions like diabetes or concomitant open surgical procedures, Use of larger incisions, longer tourniquet time, and use of drain are other contributing factors(4) .Some studies have reported increased chances of infection with hamstring autografts in comparison to patellar tendon autografts and drain application(5,6). The harvested graft is prone to infection from skin flora, and an adequate concentration of antibiotics to inhibit bacterial growth can be achieved with the local application of antibiotics over the graft(7) .The most common pathogen after ACLR is staphylococci, accounting for 90% of cases of septic arthritis (8,9). Vancomycin is commonly used locally in the surgery in Orthopaedics because of the relative safety for local use in high dosis, and bactericidal action against organisms like Staphylococcus aureus (10) on the other hand there are concerns about its use because of antibiotic resistance, high cost, and graft toxicity(11) .

The purpose of this study is to report adverse events over the 2-year follow-up period and compare groups (ACLR alone vs. ACLR + LET). Methods: Stability is a randomized clinical trial comparing hamstring tendon ACLR with and without LET. Patients aged 14–25 years with an ACL deficient knee were included. Patients were followed and adverse events documented (type, actions taken, resolution) with visits at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Adverse events were categorized as none, minor medical, minor surgical, contralateral ACL rupture, or graft rupture. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) collected at each visit included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee Score (IKDC), and ACL Quality of Life Questionnaire (ACL-QOL). Results: In total, 618 patients were randomized (mean age 18.9 years, 302 (49%) male). Forty-five patients (7%) suffered graft rupture; 34 (11%) in the ACLR group compared to 11 (4%) in the ACLR + LET group (RRR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.83, p < 0.001). There were no differences in effusion or infection rates between groups. The ACLR + LET group experienced an increased number of hardware removals (10 vs. 4). Overall, the rate of minor medical events (11%), minor surgical events (7%), and ipsilateral or contralateral ACL tears (10%) were low considering the high-risk patient profile. Increasing severity of adverse events was associated with lower PROMs at 24 months post-operative. Patients in the ACLR + LET group reported greater degree of pain at 3 months only. There were no clinically significant differences in range of motion between groups. Conclusions: The addition of LET to hamstring tendon autograft ACLR in young patients at high risk of re-injury resulted in a statistically significant reduction in graft rupture. While the addition of LET may increase rates of hardware irritation, there was no significant increase in overall rates of minor medical adverse events, minor surgical events, or overall re-operation rates. The concerns regarding complications associated with a LET did not materialize in this study.

Recently, the quadriceps tendon has been considered as a graft choice for primary ACL reconstruction due to its reliable graft size and resistance to rupture. The available literature comparing Quadriceps and Hamstring autografts in ACL reconstruction is limited. Therefore, the present study was conducted to compare the functional outcomes of these autografts using suspensory fixation at the femoral and tibial sites. Aim: To compare the functional outcomes of quadriceps tendon versus hamstring tendon autografts for primary ACL reconstruction. Materials and Methods: A randomised controlled study was conducted at Department of Orthopaedics, BLDE’s Shri BM Patil Medical College and Research Centre, Vijayapur, Karnataka, India, from January 2021 to April 2023. Thirty-four patients were included in the study and randomised into two groups: one group was operated with a quadriceps tendon graft, and the other group used a hamstring tendon autograft. Both groups underwent surgery using suspensory fixation, and postoperative rehabilitation was similar. Functional outcomes (assessed using Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores), return to preinjury activity, and complications were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare pre- and postoperative functional outcomes (Lysholm and IKDC scores) at 6, 12, and 24 months, with a significance level of p<0.05. Results: Out of 34 patients, 27 (79%) were male and 7 (21%) were female. The follow-up period ranged from a minimum of 24 months to a maximum of 26 months. The mean Lysholm score in the hamstring group increased from 47 preoperatively to 92 at six months postoperatively, while in the quadriceps group, it increased from 46 preoperatively to 90 at six months postoperatively. The reliability and validity of the IKDC score for the hamstring group also increased from 46 preoperatively to 79 at six months, and for the quadriceps group, it increased from 44 preoperatively to 78 at six months. A total 31 of the cases (91%) returned to their preinjury activity, while 3 patients (9%) (2 from the hamstring group and 1 from the quadriceps group) experienced knee stiffness, which restricted their ability to squat and sit cross-legged. There were no significant differences in Lysholm and IKDC scores between the hamstring and quadriceps tendon autografts at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Patients undergoing single bundle ACL reconstruction have comparable functional outcomes with either hamstring or quadriceps grafts at the end of the 2-year follow-up period, with no specific graft site complications. The soft tissue quadriceps tendon autograft can be considered as an equally viable option for graft selection.",,,,English,English,,,L2034905231,10.7860/JCDR/2023/64284.18350,http://dx.doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2023/64284.18350,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2034905231&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=0973709X&id=doi:10.7860%2FJCDR%2F2023%2F64284.18350&atitle=Functional+Outcomes+of+Quadriceps+Tendon+versus+Hamstring+Tendon+Autograft+using+Suspensory+Fixation+at+Femoral+and+Tibial+Sites+for+Primary+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction%3A+A+Randomised+Controlled+Study&stitle=J.+Clin.+Diagn.+Res.&title=Journal+of+Clinical+and+Diagnostic+Research&volume=17&issue=8&spage=RC17&epage=RC21&aulast=Khatri&aufirst=Ronak+Yashwantbhai&auinit=R.Y.&aufull=Khatri+R.Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=RC17-RC21&date=2023&auinit1=R&auinitm=Y,"Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Date of Publication: 31 Jul 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,31-Jul-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryBackground: ACLR with autologous tendon graft is commonly used for the treatment of ACL injury. However, as the BTI healing is poor, this can lead to a failure rate of 5% in the first-year post-operation; a long and unpredictable rehabilitation period is expected and 35 % of patients never return to preinjury level of sports. Biological enhancement of BTI healing will help to cut down the medical cost related to poor prognosis. As a biodegradable metal, Mg has been developed as implants in orthopaedics for decades, yet without clinical implants developed for ACLR. Our team has been working on this area in the past 10 years preclinically. Our animal studies showed that supplementation of magnesium wire significantly promotes osteogenesis at BTI and improves mechanical strength in ACLR. Recently, our team developed a highly pure (99.99%) Mg wire (Fig 2) in collaboration with metallic engineers for tendon graft braiding during ACLR and with its improved physical quality and strength, it is suitable for graft braiding and then its degradation in vivo can promote tunnel bone formation and bone tendon interface integration. Objective: To investigate if anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction augmented with magnesium (Mg) wire enhances osteogenesis at the bone-tendon interface (BTI), improving post-op rehabilitation and leading to better clinical outcomes. Hypothesis: Patients with ACL reconstruction using Mg wire will experience improved osteogenesis at the BTI, more effective rehabilitation, and superior knee strength and function. Design and Subjects: A multicentre, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial will recruit patients aged 18-30 with unilateral ACL tear for primary ACLR with a hamstring graft at four sites. Instruments: Mg-based wire. Interventions: Participants will receive either 99.99% purity Mg wire or 2-0 vicryl as a control. Main Outcomes: Osteogenesis will be assessed by High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT), muscle strength via Biodex tests, and functional recovery with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Tegner scores at multiple post-op intervals. Knee stability will be checked with KT-1000 arthrometer. Blood samples will be analyzed for inflammatory markers and metabolic effects related to Mg wire. Data Analysis and Expected Results: A repeated-measures ANOVA will be utilized for data analysis. The expectation is that Mg wire augmentation will significantly enhance osteogenesis at the BTI and improve rehabilitation outcomes.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05983692,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05983692,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05983692&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

The main question it aims to answer are: * which surgery gives better outcome in patients (short- and long-term results)? * are there any sings of osteoarthritis in an injured knee compared to a healthy knee? Participants will be invited to our clinic after 15 years to do clinical and functional exams with x-Ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both knees. Subjective exams with different scores (Tegner score, Lysholm score..) were also done. The same exam protocol for participant was used again after two years and fifteen years since surgery.Detailed DescriptionDouble bundle (DB) ACL reconstruction has gained popularity in the last few years. Biomechanical and intra - operative studies have shown better antero - posterior and rotational stability after DB vs. single bundle (SB) reconstruction. However, only few studies are found in the literature that have evaluated and compared clinical results between SB and DB ACL reconstruction. All reported studies used hamstrings in both DB and SB techniques. No studies were found that used patellar tendon autograft for the SB. The purpose of the present study was therefore to evaluate and compare the clinical results of DB hamstring and SB patellar tendon ACL reconstruction techniques. A total of 40 patients (29 male and 11 female, average (SD) age 36) were randomized during routine surgery (2 years after the surgery) into either double bundle (DB) or single bundle (SB) group. Patients with combined (medial, lateral or posterior) ligamentous injuries were not included in the study. ACL reconstruction in DB group was done by four tunnel hamstring technique with EndoButton femoral and cancellous screw tibial fixation. In the SB group patellar tendon autograft was fixed with titanium interference screws. The same postoperative rehabilitation protocols were used for both groups. Subjective evaluation comprised IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) subjective score, Tegner activity and Lysholm scores. Objective evaluation was done by the IKDC 2000 knee examination protocol. Antero - posterior stability was measured by KT 2000 (knee arthrometer) and by Rollimeter. One leg hop test was performed to assess the functional results. Isokinetic thigh muscle strength measurements on Biodex isokinetic dynamometer were performed. The same protocol was performed for the clinical exams after 15 years since surgery. A total of 30 patients were examen.

Methods: A retrospective case–control study was performed using a cohort of patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction between 2010 and 2020 using the same surgical procedure: Hamstring tendon autograft. The study group (group I) included all the patients (n = 94) during this period who sustained a subsequent ACL injury. The control group (group II) consisted of 94 patients randomly selected (matched Group I in terms of sex, age, and ACL graft) who did not sustain any further ACL injury. PTS was measured by two blinded surgeons on lateral knee view radiographs of the operated knee after primary ACL. BMI in kg/m(2) was measured during the preoperative anesthesia consultation. Exclusion criteria were: non-true or rotated lateral knee radiographs of the operated knee post-ACLR, associated knee ligament injury requiring surgical management, iterative knee surgeries, open growth plate, and related fracture. Results: The mean posterior tibial slope in group I was 7.5° ± 2.9, and 7.2° ± 2.0 in group II. A PTS angle cutoff was set at 10 degrees. The rate of patients showing a PTS ≥ 10° was significantly higher in group I compared to group II (p < 0.01). Patients with PTS ≥ 10° were 5.7 times more likely to sustain a subsequent ACL injury, (OR: 5.7 95% CI[1.858–17.486]). The Average BMI in group I was 24.5 ± 3.7 kg.m(−2) compared to group II which was 23.3 ± 3.0 kg.m(−2). There were no significant differences in any of the four BMI categories between both groups (p value 0.289). A series of BMI cut-offs were also analyzed at 23 to30 kg/m(2), and there was no significant difference between both groups.

Hypothesis: Positioning of an osteoconductive scaffold at the femoral tunnel aperture improves graft-to-bone incorporation and thereby decreases bone tunnel widening. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: In a 1:1 ratio, 56 patients undergoing primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were randomized to receive femoral fixation with cortical suspension fixation and secondary press-fit fixation at the tunnel aperture of the tendon graft only (control) or with augmentation by an osteoconductive scaffold (intervention). Adverse events, patient-reported outcomes, and passive knee stability were recorded over 2 years after the index surgery. Three-dimensional bone tunnel widening was assessed using computed tomography at the time of surgery and 4.5 months and 1 year postoperatively. Results: The intervention group exhibited a similar number of adverse events as the control group (8 vs 10; P =.775) including 2 partial reruptures in both groups. The approach was feasible, although 1 case was encountered where the osteoconductive scaffold was malpositioned without adversely affecting the patient’s recovery.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of repetitive extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) on return-to-sports duration, clinical results and MRI results after ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendons (HT). Material and Methods: In this prospective controlled study, all patients with acute ACL ruptures were treated by ACL reconstruction with HT. Patients were randomized into two groups (Group A: ESWT group; Group B: control group). Patients in the ESWT group received focused shockwave therapy 4, 5 and 6 weeks after ACL surgery. Follow-up investigations including IKDC score, Lysholm score, VAS and evaluation regarding return-to-sports timepoints that were conducted 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post-operation. An MRI investigation was performed 12-months post-operation and graft maturation (signal intensity ratio (SIR)) as well as femoral and tibial tunnel characteristics (bone marrow oedema, tunnel fluid effusion) were assessed. Results: In total, 65 patients (27.65 ± 7.07 years; 35 male/30 female) were included in this study. The mean timepoint for “return-to-pivoting-sports” was 27.92 weeks (±2.99) in the ESWT group as well as 42.64 weeks (±5.18) in the control group (p < 0.001). In the ESWT group 31 patients (vs. control group: n = 6) attained the “pre-injury activity level”, whereas 6 patients (vs. control group: n = 22) did not reach this level within 12 months post-operation. The IKDC score, Lysholm score, and VAS showed significant improvement in the ESWT group compared with the control group for all time-points (p < 0.001). The mean SIR in the ESWT group revealed 1.81 (±0.88), whereas the control group showed a mean SIR of 2.68 (±1.04) (p < 0.01). Discussion: In conclusion, this is the first study investigating the effect of repetitive ESWT on ACL reconstruction with clinical outcome measurements, including the duration of return-to-sports activity and an MRI follow-up examination. Return-to-sports parameters, clinical scores and graft maturation were significantly improved in the ESWT group. This study may support an earlier return-to-sports timepoint by ESWT and is of high clinical relevance as ESWT is a cost-effective treatment option with no relevant side effects.","vancomycin (1404-90-6, 1404-93-9)",,,English,English,,,L2023426209,10.3390/jcm12103350,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm12103350,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2023426209&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=20770383&id=doi:10.3390%2Fjcm12103350&atitle=Extracorporeal+Shockwave+Therapy+Improves+Outcome+after+Primary+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction+with+Hamstring+Tendons&stitle=J.+Clin.+Med.&title=Journal+of+Clinical+Medicine&volume=12&issue=10&spage=&epage=&aulast=Weninger&aufirst=Patrick&auinit=P.&aufull=Weninger+P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2023&auinit1=P&auinitm=,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Reduced Knee Flexion Strength 18 Years After ACL Reconstruction in Hamstring Group,,,,,,5/22/2025,5/22/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2023). Date of Publication: 17 Apr 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,17-Apr-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryBackground: Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) and a double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (hamstring group) graft are commonly used for ACL reconstruction. Short-term and mid-term studies show little to no significant difference between the two groups, and there are a few long term studies to compare results between the two grafts. Purpose: To compare the results after using either BPTB grafts or hamstring grafts 18 years after ACL reconstruction. Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence II. Methods: 114 patients with ACL rupture between 2001 and 2004 were randomized to reconstruction with either BPTB graft or a hamstring graft. Patients were operated at four major hospitals. The 18-year follow-up evaluation included isokinetic testing of muscle strength, patient-reported outcome measures, clinical knee examination and an assessment of radiological osteoarthritis using the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. Hypothesis:Hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the long-term outcome between the two groups, as well hypothesis of no difference in patients with prosthesis after ACL reconstruction, arthrosis difference in operated knees and the rate of graft failure between the two groups. Previous follow-up studies showed a significant difference in total flexion work between the two groups, so detecting a persistent difference between the groups will be point of interest.Detailed DescriptionIntroduction Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common soft-tissue knee injury, and has increased in number over the last twenty years. Reconstructing the ligament may be important for maintaining the stability and preventing further damaging of the knee. The two most commonly used grafts in reconstructions are the autologous patellar tendon grafts and hamstring tendon grafts There is yet to be a universally established agreement regarding which reconstruction method of an ACL is preferred. The method using the central third of the patellar tendon with proximal and distal bone blocks as the replacement has been used since the late 80s and is well documented with good results. When the technique using the hamstring tendon grafts was introduced, its popularity increased. Arguments favoring each of the methods depend on which variables one values the most. In some studies, the patellar tendon group reported problems regarding anterior knee pain and decreased sensitivity of the knee, whereas for the hamstring tendon group there was reported increased weakness of the hamstring muscles and knee laxity. However, the overall assessment and satisfaction in multiple short-term/semi-long studies have shown little to no difference . The aim of this prospective randomized multicenter study is to compare the use of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts and double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (DLSG) grafts for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, 17-20 years after the surgery. The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant differences at this long-term follow-up evaluation between the two methods. Method and material of the first study- Drogset et al. recruited 115 patients with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in the period of 2001-2004, and randomized them to either reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts fixed with metal interference screw graft, or double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (DLSG) grafts fixed with Bone Mulch Screws and WasherLoc Screws. The surgeries were performed at four different hospitals. After one and two years, the patients were examined by an independent observer, using a series of objective tests, as well as recording the patients' subjective opinion of their knee function. The subjective tests used were Tegner's activity score, Lysholm's functional score and Modified Cincinnati Score. The objective tests used were Lachmann's test, pivot shift and KT-1000, as well as Cybex and Biodex to measure muscle strength. Method and material- The present study is a long-term follow-up of a prospective randomized multicenter study. The patient recorded outcome scores will be Tegner's activity score, Lysholms's functional score and the Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The examinations include Lachmann's test, pivot shift and KT-1000. We also plan to include radiographs to evaluate the degree of arthrosis 17-20 years after the surgery, and Cybex or Biodex to examine the hamstring and quadriceps strength. The radiographic positioning will be knee AP weight-bearing standing bilateral and lateral view, as well as skyline projection. The Kellgren-Lawrence classification will be used to assess the degree of osteoarthritis. Even though 115 patients were included in the original study, we will only attempt to contact 114 due to lost inclusion-papers between the 2-year and 7-year follow-up \[8\]. During the spring of 2022, the patients will receive an invite to participate in the follow-up study. Following this, patients will be contacted to uncover different circumstances that might exclude certain patients from the clinical assessment. This includes revision of the reconstruction in question, total knee replacement or total knee arthroplasty, and if the knee had been injured beforehand. The clinical examination will be carried out by both a medical student and an experienced orthopedic surgeon. Hopefully all the patients will be examined over the course of two days at each location, and if needed, the rest will be examined at a later date. Hypothesis- Current hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the long-term outcome between the two groups. However, it will be interesting to see how many patients have received a prosthesis, and how many patients struggle with arthrosis. As the previous follow-up studies showed a significant difference in total flexion work between the two groups, we will be interested in detecting a persistent difference between the groups. Another interesting aspect will be the rate of graft failure between the two groups. Feasibility- The strength of the study is the randomization and the long follow-up period of 17-20 years. The possible limitations are the fact that there may be a problem recruiting enough patients to the follow-up, and that it might not be able to get x-rays of the patients at the different hospitals, as this is a matter of cost and availability. In addition, the different hospitals may not have a Biodex available. Publicity plan- The goal for the paper is to be published in an international journal and probably be presented at conferences. For article, that hopefully will be published in journals, Marko Popovic will stand as first author, and Julie Holen and Julie Myhre as contributing authors. Jon Olav Drogset will be listed last, as the main supervisor. Ethics- The REK-application was submitted on the 24th of December 2021. Application number: 391796. Additionally, the project will be reported to NSD when the REK-application is approved.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05876013,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05876013,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05876013&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Comparison of Two Muscle Strengthening Programs on the Return-to-exercise Criteria in Patients With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,,,,,,6/3/2025,6/3/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2023). Date of Publication: 30 Mar 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,30-Mar-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament injury is very common in recreational and elite athletes. It is considered the second most frequent pathology seeing in Sports Medicine Services. After the injury and ACLR, there is a marked decrease in the strength of the knee extensors/flexors muscles. Strength exercise programs are aimed at recovering strength and functionality, however, a low percentage of patients manage to achieve the optimal return-to-exercise criteria. Therefore, it is relevant to design and evaluate exercise programs that allow early recovery of muscle strength and knee functionality. The main purpose of this study is to investigate a neuromuscular exercise program compared with a standard institutional program in the recovery of the strength and functionality of the knee extensor/flexor muscles after ACLR.Detailed DescriptionStudy design: this is a 22-week, randomized trial. 62 participants will be recruited from the medical services of the National Institute of Rehabilitation (NIR). Participants: adults between 20-40 years old, with a body mass index \<30.0 kg/mˆ2, history of sports practice immediately prior to the injury, post-operated unilaterally for ACL with the hamstring autograft technique (semitendinosus-gracilis tendons), with full ranges of motion and no edema will be recruited. Participants with multi-ligament knee injuries, with more than 12 months from the injury to surgery or more than 8 months after surgery, with uncompensated metabolic diseases or acute illnesses/infections under treatment will not be recruited. Intervention: participants will be randomized to 1) neuromuscular or 2) institutional exercise program with computer-generated random numbers. Both programs consist of isotonic open and closed kinetic chain exercises for the hip and knee. The neuromuscular program also includes exercises to improve vastus medialis and lateralis strength, hamstrings, hip flexors and extensors, proprioception, and core stability. On the other hand, the institutional program includes concentric and eccentric knee exercises. Both programs will be performed 3 days/week, 3 sets, 18-22 repetitions for each exercise; the intensity will initiate at 65-75% (1RM), and it will be increased to 75-85%; the workload will be increased 5-10% from the fifth week according to perceived exertion. The exercises will be done with both legs; however, the injured leg will be exercised complementary. The last 6 weeks of the programs correspond to functional exercises according the sport. Every training session will consist of 15 minutes of warm-up, 40-60 minutes of resistance training, and 15 minutes of cool-down; all training sessions will take place in the NIR Sports Medicine therapeutic gym. The knee flexors/extensors muscle strength will be determined by isokinetic dynamometry (at 60°/s). The knee function will be evaluated by hop tests and agility T-test. The patient's perception of daily functional activities after ACL reconstruction will be assessed by the Lysholm knee score. For each participant, the study length will be 22 weeks with 66 exercise sessions. The beginning of the study corresponds to session 1 of exercise. Initial evaluation will be performed 5 days prior to the start of the intervention, while final evaluations will be conducted at the end of 22 weeks of follow-up (2 days after the last day of the intervention).

A knee brace may provide subjective safety but can cause damage if applied incorrectly. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a knee brace on clinical outcomes following isolated ACLR using HT autograft. Methods: In this prospective randomised trial, 114 adults (32.4 ± 11.5 years, 35.1% women) underwent isolated ACLR using HT autograft after primary ACL rupture. Patients were randomly assigned to wear either a knee brace (n = 58) or no brace (n = 56) for 6 weeks postoperatively. An initial examination was performed preoperatively, and at 6 weeks and 4, 6, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score to measure participants’ subjective perceptions. Secondary endpoints included objective knee function assessed by IKDC, instrumented knee laxity measurements, isokinetic strength tests of the knee extensors and flexors, Lysholm Knee Score, Tegner Activity Score, Anterior Cruciate Ligament—Return to Sport after Injury Score, and quality of life determined by Short Form-36 (SF36). Results: There were no statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences in IKDC scores between the two study groups (3.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.39 to 7.97, p = 0.03 for evidence of non-inferiority of brace-free compared with brace-based rehabilitation). The difference in Lysholm score was 3.20 (95% CI −2.47 to 8.87); the difference in SF36 physical component score 0.09 (95% CI −1.93 to 3.03). In addition, isokinetic testing did not reveal any clinically relevant differences between the groups (n.s.). Conclusions: Brace-free rehabilitation is non-inferior to a brace-based protocol regarding physical recovery 1 year after isolated ACLR using HT autograft.

Graft size was discovered to be an important factor in lowering ACL failure rates. Also, extraarticular tenodesis decreases recurrent instability, A comparative study was done to compare the effect of graft size and lateral external tenodesis on the recurrence of instability after ACL-R. Patients and methods: A Prospective Blinded Randomized Controlled study included 100 consecutive patients who underwent ACL-R with hamstring tendon grafts in our Hospital. The patients were allocated into two groups (Group A and B) with randomization; group A received ACL-R with a large-size ACL-graft diameter of 6 strands, and group B received ACL-R of 4 strands combined with lateral extraarticular tenodesis (LET) (Modified Lemaire). Each group had fifty patients. The follow-up time was two years. They were examined for graft failure, anterolateral rotatory instability with the pivot shift test, and clinical outcomes, which were evaluated with the International Knee Documentation Committee score (IKDC) both subjective and objective. Results: In this study; group A, graft failure occurred in three (6.3%) patients, a positive pivot shift test grade I was detected in eight (17.8%) patients, grade II in three (6.7%) patients, and grade III in one (2.2%) patient. The subjective IKDC score was 87.9 (± 7.19) points. The objective IKDC score was normal or nearly normal in 43 (93.4%) patients. In group B, one (2.1%) patient had graft failure, five (10.9%) had a positive pivot shift test grade I, one (2.1%) had a grade II, and no patient had a grade III. The subjective IKDC score was 91.9 (± 8.9) points. The objective IKDC score was normal or nearly normal in 44 (95.6%) patients. As regard the subjective IKDC score, there was a non-significant difference between both groups (p value = 0.465). Conclusion: Both groups showed a low ACL-graft failure rate, low anterolateral rotatory instability, and a good clinical outcome. Although there was no significant difference in subjective IKDC score between both groups, the failure rate and anterolateral rotatory instability were significantly lower in the ACL-R (4 strands) with LET combination group than in the group with the large-diameter (6 strands) graft.

PURPOSE: To identify whether the use of a quadrupled semitendinosus tendon (ST) or doubled semitendinosus tendon and gracilis tendon (ST/G) graft provides comparable anterior tibial translation (ATT) with similar functional results and similar donor site morbidity. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: This was a prospective, patient- and surgeon-blinded, randomized trial set in a busy orthopaedic and traumatology department at a university hospital. Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 162 patients with ACL lesions were randomized to undergo ACLR with either a quadrupled ST or doubled ST/G graft. The primary endpoint was ATT assessed with the KT-1000 arthrometer. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of the visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective evaluation form, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner activity scale, and Lysholm knee scoring scale. RESULTS: Preoperative demographic data, ATT, and PROM scores showed no significant differences. At 4.5 years, no significant differences were found between the ST and ST/G groups with respect to PROM scores and KT-1000 arthrometer, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test findings. Differences in functional results between groups were significant (muscle strength). Subgroup analysis revealed significantly increased ATT in female patients undergoing ACLR with a quadrupled ST graft during the 4.5-year observation period, as assessed by the KT-1000 arthrometer, as well as inferior KOOS, IKDC, Lysholm, and VAS scores. CONCLUSION: This study showed a significant increase in ATT as well as inferior results on PROMs during a 4.5-year observation period in female patients undergoing ACLR with a quadrupled ST graft. In male patients, the study provided evidence of the noninferiority of ACLR with an ST graft, with no influence on donor site morbidity.

Patient preferences should be accounted for as a part of shared decision making. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to perform a discrete choice experiment that evaluated patient preferences toward ACL autografts. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in patient preferences between groups. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Patients aged 18 to 25 years who underwent shoulder arthroscopy at a single institution between 2013 and 2019 were included in the study as a proxy for healthy controls. Patients with a history of ACL tear were excluded. A discrete choice experiment was developed from a literature search and used the following data points as they pertain to BTB or hamstring autograft: risk of developing a significant complication, return-to-play rate, risk of anterior knee pain with kneeling, and risk of additional surgery due to graft failure. Included patients completed a custom survey in which they were asked to choose between “surgery A” (hamstring) and “surgery B” (BTB). Results: A total of 107 participants were included in the analysis. Of these participants, 39 (36.5%) chose surgery A (hamstring) and 68 (63.6%) chose surgery B (BTB). When comparing the hamstring group with the BTB group, there was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, race, level of education, or employment status. However, 80.5% of self-reported athletes preferred BTB (P =.008). When controlling for age, sex, and body mass index, patients in the BTB group were more likely to rate return to sport (risk ratio [RR] = 1.49 [95% CI, 1.18-1.98]; P =.001) and the risk of requiring additional surgery due to graft failure (RR = 1.26 [95% CI, 1.02-1.58]; P =.037) as highly important. Conversely, they were less likely than patients in the hamstring group to rate pain while kneeling (RR = 0.65 [95% CI, 0.98-1.05]; P <.001) and complication risk (RR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59-0.94]; P =.013) as important.

Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Quadriceps Tendon Bone Autograft,,,,,,5/6/2025,5/6/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2023). Date of Publication: 4 Jan 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,4-Jan-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament injuries are one of the most common sports knee injuries. Their effect on the knee joint can be detrimental with patients experiencing instability and progressive damage of the intraarticular structures. Therefore, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is often indicated. Multiple graft option exist, including autograft, allograft and xenograft tissues, with autografts being considered as a first-choice source of reconstructed ligament in most cases. Two most common harvested autografts are hamstring tendons (semitendinosus or semitendinosus and gracilis tendons; ST or STG) and patellar tendon with two bone blocks (bone - patellar tendon - bone; BPTB). However, in the recent literature there is an increasing trend towards use of quadriceps tendon autograft (QT). Multiple techniques of harvesting this graft were described, including both partial and complete thickness of the tendon. Another issue is whether bone block from the upper pole of the patella is harvested along with the soft tissues (quadriceps tendon bone graft, QTB). The aim of this study is to add to the body of knowledge concerning full-thickness quadriceps tendon-bone autograft (QTB) used in ACLR.

These receptors start disappearing after tear and degenerate by the end of a year. Retaining these receptors can help in early rehabilitation, graft ligamentization and reducing postoperative graft re-ruptures. Objectives: To evaluate proprioception post ACL reconstruction between remnant retaining and remnant non retaining group by Lysholm knee score and clinical propriception assessment. Methods: Participants between age 15-45 years within 6 months of ACL injury presented to our hospital between January 2021 to December 2021 were randomised and divided into two groups of remnant retaining (RR) and non-Remnant retaining surgery (NRR), were evaluated by joint position sense weight bearing (WB) and non-weight bearing (NWB) tests, followed by functional scoring with Lysholm knee score at 6weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Result: 31 patients (M-18, F-13) were enrolled in RR (n-17) and NRR (n-14) depending upon surgical technique with mean age 34.1±7.6 years and 32.2±4.8 years respectively. Preoperative mean scores were 53±4.4 and 52±5.7 in each group. Mean of preoperative NWB test were 42±2.7 (RR) and 40.7±3 (NRR) respectively. Mean score of the preoperative WB test were 44.3±3.3 (RR) and 44±3.3 (NRR) respectively. At 6 weeks, RR group had score 63±3.4, NWB 40.4±2.8, WB 42.3±3. NRR group had similar picture (Score 66±2.8, NWB 42.5±2.4, and WB 46.3±2.6). There was significant difference in score and proprioception test between groups at the end of 6 months and thereafter till 2 years.

Use of Nordic Hamstring Exercise to Improve Hamstrings Function in Patients After ACL Reconstruction,,,,,,5/31/2025,5/31/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2022). Date of Publication: 2 Nov 2022,clinicaltrials.gov,2022,,,,,2-Nov-22,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries constitute a significant portion of major knee joint injuries sustained by young, active individuals, and significantly increase risk for long-term disability. Yet the recommended solution to restore joint stability following injury--ACL reconstruction (ACLR)--does not prevent post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis (PTOA). Post-traumatic quadriceps (dys)function is a hallmark characteristic following ACLR, reported to accelerate the onset of PTOA after ACL injury, making the recovery of muscle function a primary concern to clinicians. However, hamstrings muscle function is drastically underrepresented relative to the quadriceps in the context of recovery from ACLR, which impedes the ability to develop targeted treatment approaches. Persistent hamstrings weakness is widely reported in patients who undergo ACLR with a hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, which increases ACL strain, and may contribute to higher graft failure rates in this population. To effectively treat muscular impairments, underlying neuromuscular adaptations known to occur in response to ACLR must be targeted. Eccentric exercise is uniquely suited to enhance neuromuscular function. The Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) is a specific form of eccentric exercise that is clinically relevant and easy to implement, but has not been explored as an intervention for hamstrings neuromuscular dysfunction in patients who undergo ACLR with HT. To establish an evidence-based treatment model, the investigators will use a single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial to establish the feasibility and efficacy of a 4-week NHE protocol in patients who undergo ACLR with HT. Separate factorial ANOVAs will be used to assess the effects of group (NHE, control) and time (baseline, 4 weeks) on selected outcomes. Effect sizes will be calculated for within- and between-group comparisons. The investigators expect to observe improvements in hamstrings neuromuscular function following the NHE protocol, and that those improvements will be greater than the control group. Additionally, the investigators expect the protocol to be feasible in terms of intervention adherence and patient retention. This study will identify specific barriers to the implementation of NHE in patients who undergo ACLR with HT, and will provide support for the application of an easy to implement clinical intervention able to address a complex neurophysiological problem.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05738200,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05738200,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05738200&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate ACL graft and contralateral rupture following ipsilateral or contralateral semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) graft harvest at follow-up of a minimum 10 years post-reconstruction in the treatment of a complete ACL tear. METHODS: Patients from a previous randomized trial were evaluated. The primary outcome measures were ipsilateral and contralateral reinjury as well as the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, the ACL Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QoL) and the Tegner activity scale. Participants completed four different single-leg hop tests and concentric knee flexion and extension strength were assessed on an isokinetic dynamometer. RESULTS: Of the original 100 patients, 50 patients (41.3 ± 9.5 years of age, 31 males, 19 females) reported on re-injury at 12.6 ± 1.4 years post-operative. Thirty-eight patients returned for full assessment and 12 responded by mail or phone survey. There were no differences between groups for graft rupture, contralateral injury, ACL-QoL score, IKDC categorization, or anterior tibial translation, though both groups experienced a reduction in the Tegner Activity Scale from their preinjury scores. There was no difference in knee flexor and extensor isokinetic concentric strength, or single leg hop test performance. Knee flexor strength limb symmetry index was reduced when measured in the supine relative to the seated position in both groups, indicating persistent deficits in knee flexor strength when measured in the supine position. CONCLUSION: Contralateral hamstring harvest does not put patients at an increased risk of a contralateral ACL tear and long-term outcomes of ACL reconstruction do not differ based on the side of graft harvest.

Recently, several studies have shown that the inclination of the tibial plateau in the sagittal plane affects the stability of the knee joint. The purpose of this study was to determine if an increased posterior slope of the tibia is associated with failure of ACL reconstruction irrespective of the graft used. Methods: From June 2002 to August 2003, a total of 100 patients with a symptomatic ACL-deficient knee were randomised to receive either a hamstring autograft or posterior tibialis allograft. All allografts were from a single tissue bank, aseptically processed, and fresh-frozen without terminal irradiation. ACL graft failures requiring reoperation with a minimum of 10-year follow-up were identified via telephone survey. Lateral radiographs of the knee of all patients were reviewed, and the slope of the tibia was measured using a standardised technique. Two fellowship-trained orthopaedic sports medicine specialists, one board-certified general orthopaedic surgeon, and two fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists measured the tibial slope in all patients. Results: At a minimum of 10-year follow-up, there were four (8.3%) autograft and 13 (26.5%) allograft failures that required revision reconstruction. The overall average tibial slope of the nonfailure cohort was 9.4°. The overall average tibial slope of the failure cohort was 11.9° (P ​= ​0.0002). The average slope of the allograft failures was 11.5°compared with an average slope of 9.6° in the nonfailures (P ​= ​0.01). The average slope of the autograft failures was 13.1° compared with 9.3° in the nonfailures (P ​= ​0.011).

PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The present study aimed to compare instrumented knee joint laxity and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after ACL repair with those after primary ACL reconstruction for acute isolated ACL tears. It was hypothesized that ACL repair would lead to comparable knee joint stability and PROs at 5 years postoperatively in comparison with ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A total of 85 patients with acute ACL tears were randomized to undergo either ACL repair using dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) or primary ACL reconstruction with a semitendinosus tendon autograft. The primary outcome was the side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation (ΔATT) assessed by Rolimeter testing at 5 years postoperatively. Follow-up examinations were performed at 1, 2, and 5 years. PROs were assessed using the Tegner activity scale, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score, and the Lysholm score. Furthermore, the rates of recurrent instability, other complications, and revision surgery were recorded. A power analysis was performed a priori, and the Friedman test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Bonferroni correction were applied for statistical comparisons with significance set at P < .05. RESULTS: The mean age at inclusion was 28.3 ± 11.5 years in the ACL repair group and 27.1 ± 11.5 years in the ACL reconstruction group. At 5 years postoperatively, a total of 64 patients (ACL repair: n = 34 of 43 [79%]; ACL reconstruction: n = 30 of 42 [71%]) were available for follow-up. At 5 years, ΔATT was 1.7 ± 1.6 mm in the ACL repair group and 1.4 ± 1.3 mm in the ACL reconstruction group (P = .334). Preinjury PROs were restored as soon as 1 year after surgery and plateaued until 2 and 5 years postoperatively in both groups. At the 5-year follow-up, the mean Lysholm score was 97.0 ± 5.4 versus 94.5 ± 5.5 (P = .322), respectively, and the mean IKDC subjective score was 94.1 ± 9.9 versus 89.9 ± 7.8 (P = .047), respectively, in the ACL repair group versus ACL reconstruction group. At 5 years postoperatively, 12 patients in the ACL repair group (35%; age <25 years: n = 10/12; Tegner score ≥7: n = 10/12) had recurrent instability, of whom 10 underwent single-stage revision ACL reconstruction. In the ACL reconstruction group, there were 6 patients with recurrent instability (20%; age <25 years: n = 6/6; Tegner score ≥7: n = 5/6); however, in 5 patients, staged revision was required. Differences between both groups regarding recurrent instability (P = .09) or ACL revision surgery (P = .118) were not statistically significant. Recurrent instability was associated with age <25 years and Tegner score >7 in both groups. CONCLUSION: At 5 years after ACL repair with DIS, instrumented knee joint laxity and PROs were comparable with those after ACL reconstruction. Although no significant difference was found between repair and reconstruction, a critical appraisal of the rates of recurrent instability (35% vs 20%, respectively) and revision surgery (38% vs 27%, respectively) is needed. Young age and a high preinjury activity level were the main risk factors for recurrent instability in both groups. However, single-stage revision ACL reconstruction was possible in each case in the ACL repair group. Although ACL reconstruction remains the gold standard in the treatment of ACL tears, the present study supports the use of ACL repair with DIS as a feasible option to treat acute ACL tears in patients aged ≥25 years with low to moderate activity levels (Tegner score <7).

ACL Reconstruction with Bone Tendon Bone (BTB) Autograft with Versus Without Internal Brace - Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes,,,,,,6/3/2025,6/3/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2022). Date of Publication: 4 Sep 2022,clinicaltrials.gov,2022,,,,,4-Sep-22,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThere is no consensus regarding the best surgical management of primary ACL tears. Recent evidence suggests that internal brace augmentation may increase load failure and therefore stabilize the graft in-situ at the time of ACL reconstruction. This prospective randomized controlled trial aims to compare the time to return to activity, and participant reported outcomes in participants with bone-tendon-bone ACL reconstruction with and without (control) internal brace augmentation.Detailed DescriptionDespite the wide variety of surgical approaches and grafts that can be used in an ACL reconstruction, graft failure and recurrent knee instability are nevertheless ubiquitous issues that have facilitated interest in ways to strengthen the graft at the time of surgery. While both animal and biomechanical models have strongly suggested improved graft strength and patient outcomes by utilizing suture tape augmentation in ACL reconstructions, there is scant clinical literature available to assess these extrapolations. A retrospective cohort study of 60 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with a hamstring autograft or allograft (30 suture tape vs 30 no suture tape; mean age: 30), found shorter time to return to activity (9.2 months suture tape group vs 12.9 months no suture tape group; p=0.002), lower Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Indices (WOMAC) (2.2 suture tape group vs 6.2 no suture tape group; p=0.024), higher international knee documentation committee (IKDC) scores (87.6 suture tape group vs 73.2 no suture tape group; p=0.006), lower average pain on the national pain rating scale (NPRS) (0.6 suture tape group vs 1.66 no suture tape group; p=0.021) and no significant difference in range of motion in degrees (129 suture tape group vs 127 no suture tape group; p=0.46), knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) (92.2 suture tape group vs 87.1 no suture tape group; p=0.68), or complications (13% suture tape vs 10% no suture tape; p\>0.05) at 2 years follow up. A retrospective cohort study of 108 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with a hamstring autograft with and without suture tape reinforcement (36 suture tape vs 72 no suture tape; mean age: 25), found a significantly higher Tegner activity score (7.1 suture tape group vs 6.4 no suture tape group; p=0.026) but otherwise no significant difference in time to preinjury activity level (11.9 mos suture tape group vs 11.6 no suture tape group; p=0.59), range of motion (degrees) (136 suture tape group vs 137 no suture tape group; p=0.44) , Lysholm knee score (95.6 suture tape group vs 94 no suture tape group; p=0.165), IKDC score (94.4 suture tape group vs 93.8 no suture tape group; p=0.44), or complications (6% suture tape group vs 5% no suture tape group; p\>0.05) at 2 years follow up. A prospective cohort study of 50 ACL reconstructions with hamstring autograft with and without suture tape reinforcement (25 suture tape group vs 25 no suture tape group; mean age: 30), found a significant improvement in greater than 2 grades of Lachman testing from preoperative assessment compared to 6 months follow-up (68% suture tape group vs 32% no suture tape group; p=0.039) but no difference in Lysholm knee score at 6 months (87.0 suture tape group vs 87.0 no suture tape group; p=0.756). Moreover, none of the already-limited clinical data investigates the use of internal braces with bone-tendon-bone grafts, which are a popular choice for young adults and athletes. Furthermore, there are no current level 1 data on this subject. Therefore, this study aims to compare the time to return to pre- injury activity level, incidence of recurrent knee instability, and patient reported outcomes of patients treated with ACL reconstruction using bone-tendon-bone autograft with and without (control group) internal brace stabilization.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05532189,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05532189,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05532189&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

It remains unclear whether extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) can promote graft healing after ACLR. Purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic and graft maturation effects of ESWT in hamstring autograft ACLR. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Between May 18, 2019, and September 20, 2019, we randomly assigned 30 patients who met study inclusion criteria to 2 groups. Patients in the control group followed a 5-week advanced rehabilitation training program (30 minutes/session, 5 times/week) starting at 3 months postoperatively. In the ESWT group, together with the 5-week advanced rehabilitation training, radial ESWT was applied once a week for 5 weeks. Functional scores (Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee, and Tegner scores), KT-1000 arthrometer knee laxity measurement, and magnetic resonance imaging scans were assessed at 3 months (baseline), 6 months, and 24 months postoperatively. To evaluate graft maturation, we assessed the graft signal-to-noise quotients (SNQs) of the tibial, intra-articular, and femoral sides on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Data were compared between the ESWT and control groups. Results: In total, 26 patients (13 with ESWT, 13 controls) were assessed. There were no significant between-group differences on any assessment at baseline, and no significant within-group or between-group differences were found in knee laxity at any point. At 24-month follow-up, the ESWT group had significantly higher Lysholm and Tegner scores compared with the controls (P =.012 and.017, respectively). Regarding graft maturation, at 6-month follow-up, the SNQ of the tibial intraosseous graft was significantly lower in the ESWT group versus controls (P =.006), but no differences were detected at the femoral intraosseous graft (P =.321) or the intra-articular graft (P =.314). At 24-month follow-up, the SNQs of the femoral intraosseous graft and intra-articular graft were significantly lower in the ESWT group versus controls (P =.020 and.044, respectively) but no difference was found at the tibial intraosseous graft (P =.579). Conclusion: Both enhanced graft maturation and improved functional scores at 24-month follow-up were seen in patients who received radial ESWT during rehabilitation after hamstring autograft ACLR.

Injury of the ALL is commonly associated with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. If left untreated, ALL lesions may lead to residual anterolateral rotational instability of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which is a common cause of anterior cruciate ligament graft failure. The function of the ALL can be restored by lateral extraarticular tenodesis or anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR). In the lateral extraarticular tenodesis procedure, a strip of the iliotibial band is placed in a non-anatomical position to restrain the internal rotation of the tibia, while in ALLR, a free graft is fixed at the insertion points of the native ALL. Gracilis and semitendinosus grafts have mainly been utilized for ALLR, but other autografts have also been suggested. Furthermore, allografts and synthetic grafts have been applied to minimize donor-site morbidity and maximize the size and strength of the graft.

Reconstruction of this ligament with hamstring tendon has been time-tested but peroneus longus autograft is also gaining popularity. However, very limited literature is available comparing the two grafts. This study aims to compare the functional outcome and donor site morbidity between hamstrings and peroneus longus autograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: A prospective randomised study was conducted on 45 patients, who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were assigned into Hamstring group and the Peroneus longus group. Functional outcome was assessed using Lysholm score and Modified Cincinnati scores for the knee joint and American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Scoring for ankle joint. Donor site morbidity was assessed by measuring flexion and extension strength of the knee and plantar flexion and eversion strength of the ankle by handheld dynamometer preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and 1 year follow up. Results: Functional outcome of the knee showed significant improvement in peroneus longus group (p-value 0.002) compared to hamstring group. Even though there was minimal reduction in functional outcome of the ankle at 6 months follow-up in peroneus longus group, it improved at one year follow-up. While assessing the donor site morbidity at the knee joint, knee flexion strength showed improvement in the group (p-value 0.02) but reduced in the hamstring group where the hamstring tendon was harvested. Knee extension strength in the hamstring group scored marginally better than the peroneus longus group, which was not statistically significant (p-value 0.5). Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint.",,,,English,English,,,L2015583944,10.1177/22104917221088335,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/22104917221088335,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2015583944&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=22104925&id=doi:10.1177%2F22104917221088335&atitle=Is+Peroneus+longus+autograft+a+better+alternative+to+the+Hamstring+autograft+for+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3F+%E2%80%93+A+randomised+control+study&stitle=J.+Orthop.+Traum.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+Orthopaedics%2C+Trauma+and+Rehabilitation&volume=29&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Vijay&aufirst=&auinit=C.&aufull=Vijay+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=C&auinitm=,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Optimizing GRAft SElection for ACL Reconstruction (GRASE-ACL Trial) - a Three-armed Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,6/2/2025,6/2/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2022). Date of Publication: 4 Apr 2022,clinicaltrials.gov,2022,,,,,4-Apr-22,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryPurpose: To investigate the differences between the three most common methods for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), to support the development of the best method for the individual patient. Main research area: ¨ Sports Orthopedic Surgical research. State of the art: Every year in Denmark 2500 patients receive surgical reconstruction surgery to replace a ruptured ACL. Many patients experience a decline in knee function and 4-12% suffer a new ACL rupture within 5 years. According to data from the Danish ACL register, three methods of reconstruction are most prevalent, but with large variation between hospitals. This indicates lack of consensus on optimal surgical procedure. Design: Assessor-blinded randomized controlled study. 150 patients aged 18-40 with ruptured ACL are allocated to reconstruction with tendon(s) harvested from either the semitendinosus and gracilis, or the patella tendon, or the quadriceps tendon. Patient follow-up will be conducted preoperatively and 1, 6, 12, 24 months postoperatively. Primary technologies and outcomes: * Patient-reported knee-joint function, quality of life and donor-site morbidity is obtained with standardized questionnaires. Primary outcome is subjective knee function with the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form (IKDC) * Instrumented analysis of knee-joint coordination and neuromuscular control including 3-D motion capture and electromyography (EMG) during single leg jumps, landings and change-of-direction. Measurement of maximal explosive muscle power in knee extension and flexion. Primary outcome is relative difference between injured and healthy leg in rate of force development (RFD-LSI). * Standard clinical knee examination of range of motion and instrumented examination of knee-joint stability. * Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thigh muscles for examination of muscle morphology. The trial is designed for publication in three primary publications 1. \- Patient reported effect of graft choice in ACL reconstruction 2. \- Biomechanical effect of graft choice in ACL reconstruction 3. \- Clinical effect of graft choice in ACL reconstruction Additional secondary publications are in the pipeline. Reference to primary protocol and results will always be emphasized in secondary publication to ensure methodological transparency.Detailed DescriptionPurpose: The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effect of graft choice in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery, primarily from a patient-centered as well as a novel biomechanical perspective; and secondly from a clinical and muscle morphological perspective. The study compares the three most common methods for ACL reconstruction: autograft harvested from the m. quadriceps tendon (QT), the hamstring tendons (ST/Gr), and the patella tendon (BPTB). By applying this 360° scientific approach, it is the hope to improve the possibilities for a much-needed evidence-based and individualized treatment of ACL ruptures. Objectives and hypotheses: • Objective no. 1: The patient-centered perspective To investigate the effect of graft choice on patient-reported questionnaire scores, primarily on the International Knee Documentation Committee Evaluation Form (IKDC). The investigators hypothesize that of all three grafts, the QT graft will result in non-inferior patient reported knee function. * Objective no. 2: The biomechanical perspective To investigate the effect of graft choice on muscle strength and knee joint control. The investigators hypothesize that of all three grafts, the ST/Gr graft will show largest negative effect on explosive muscle strength. * Objective no. 3: The clinical perspective To explore the effect of graft choice on knee stability and surgery complications. * Objective no. 4: The muscle morphological perspective To explore the effect of graft choice on length and cross section area of the hamstring tendons. State-of-the-art: The most common method for ACL reconstruction in Denmark is the use of an autograft to replace the ruptured ACL. The autograft is harvested from either the m. quadriceps tendon (QT), the m. semitendinosus and m. gracilis tendons (hamstrings) (ST/Gr), or the patella tendon with bone plugs (BPTB). The BPTB graft was initially used as standard method. It has the advantages of faster graft incorporation (bone to bone healing), reliable graft size and low risk of graft rupture and knee laxity. It is widely used around the world. In Denmark it accounts for app. 10% of all reconstructions. A number of disadvantages of the BPTB graft have been described in the literature: anterior knee pain, pain from the donor site, extension strength deficits, and decreased knee joint flexion range of motion. Due to these potential morbidity problems of the BPTB graft, there was a shift towards the ST/Gr graft as the preferred choice. Today, the ST/Gr graft is harvested in more than 52% of all ACL reconstructions in Denmark. From a surgeon's perspective, the graft is easy to harvest, time efficient, and leaves smaller scars. The ST/Gr graft is however associated with increased laxity of the knee joint compared to the BPTB graft, and the size of the graft can be a challenge. Also, harvest of the ST/Gr graft is associated with sustained loss of strength, length, and volume of the harvested muscles. This is of concern, as biomechanical research has shown that semitendinosus is essential to stabilize the knee joint and protect the ACL during cutting movements. Finally, recent research indicates higher risk of revision surgery using the ST/Gr graft compared to the BPTB graft. Currently, particularly in Scandinavia, surgeons are reintroducing a third graft, the QT graft. The advantages of the QT graft are large and predictable graft size and acceptable clinical outcomes. A recent study from the Sports Orthopedic Research Center - Copenhagen (SORC-C) at Hvidovre Hospital found no difference in revision rates between the ST/Gr graft and the QT graft in a cohort of more than 400 patients. The QT graft now accounts for app. 10% of all ACL reconstructions in Denmark, but the graft remains a relatively untested method. Methods: Study design and approvals: This is an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial with a three-group parallel design. Patients will be randomized to ACL reconstruction with either BPTB, ST/Gr, or QT graft with a 1:1:1 allocation. Follow-up will be performed 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after reconstruction. The study will adhere to the CONSORT guidelines for reporting of Multi-Arm Parallel-Group Randomized Trials (http://www.consort-statement.org) and is pre-registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. The study is approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee for the Capital Region (Journal-no.: H-19001194) and by the Danish Data Protection Agency (Jr. no. VD-2018-524) Randomization and blinding: Patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment group using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using a randomization schedule of permuted blocks of random sizes. The randomization will be stratified by biological sex and age. The final randomization will be made after arthroscopic assessment of the knee and evaluation according to the in- and exclusion criteria. Outcome assessors are blinded to group allocation. Before each patient visit, tape will be placed on possible scars to hide donor graft site. Given the nature of the intervention, blinding of patients and surgeons is not feasible. Treatment: The procedure is initiated with knee arthroscopy. Ligament lesions, meniscus tear, and cartilage damage are inspected and treated if indicated, and ACL remnants are removed. The BPTB graft is harvested through two 4-5 cm incisions, one on the tibial tuberosity and one on the patella. The middle 10 mm of the patella tendon plus 20-30 mm bone plugs at each end from corresponding tibia and patella is harvested. The ST/Gr graft is harvested through a 4-5 cm incision at the pes anserinus. Both the semitendinosus and the gracilis tendon is identified and harvested. The tendons are prepared and folded to a four-stranded graft with a total diameter of 7-10 mm. The QT graft is harvested through a 4-5 cm incision at the upper pole of the patella. A graft sized 10-12 mm in with and app. 6 mm in depth is harvested from the middle part of the tendon. The femoral tunnel is placed anatomically central in the native footprint of the ACL. The tibia tunnel is also placed anatomically; the center of the tunnel being medially between the eminential spines at the level of the posterior margin of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. The BPTB graft is fixed both proximally and distally with a Milagro screw (DePuy Synthes) or similar . The ST/Gr and QT grafts are fixed proximally with the RIGIDFIX® Curve Cross Pin System (DePuy Synthes) and distally with a Milagro screw (DePuy Synthes) or similar. The patients are referred to rehabilitation according to Danish rehabilitation guidelines following ACL reconstruction. ¨ Statistics: Analysis will be performed with a linear mixed-effects model of the relationships between outcomes and treatment group (BPTB, ST/Gr, and QT graft) and time points (pre-operative, 1-month, 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-up). Fixed effects are time and treatment group, and random effects are patient ID. Sample size: The study includes two primary outcomes, the IKDC score change between treatment groups from pre-operative to 12-months follow-up, and the LSI-RFD between treatment groups at 12-months follow-up. The two outcomes are of different hypotheses and independent. Based on literature, the minimal clinically important difference in IKDC score is approximately 10 points, and the standard deviation on the change in IKDC score from baseline to after ACL reconstruction is approximately 13 points. Based on these assumptions, 37 patients are needed per group (α = 0.05, β = 0.80). A local unpublished pilot study of 10 healthy individuals showed a minimal detectable difference in LSI-RFD of 12% and a standard deviation in the group of 17%. Based on these assumptions, 40 patients are needed per group (α = 0.05, β = 0.80). A total inclusion number of 150 is decided to account for a patient dropout of app. 10%.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05342441,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05342441,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05342441&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

The Effect of Accelerated Rehabilitation After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With and Without Suture Tape Reinforcement,,,,,,6/1/2025,6/1/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2022). Date of Publication: 14 Feb 2022,clinicaltrials.gov,2022,,,,,14-Feb-22,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of accelerated rehabilitation post ACL reconstruction with and without augmentation on graft healing and return to normal activity clinically by scoring system and radiologically.Detailed DescriptionACL reconstruction is the most commonly performed knee ligament reconstruction and employs a variety of surgical techniques. However, despite high success rates, it is still challenged by residual laxity and graft rupture. While the majority of patients who undergo ACLR will have good to excellent results, a subset of patients is at a higher risk for graft failure. For those that require revision surgery, the second operation often fails. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries account for 50% of knee ligament injuries for high school-aged adults. The most commonly used autografts for ACLR are the hamstring tendons (HT) and the bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB). However, questions remain about how patients with either an HT or a BPTB autograft recover knee muscle strength postoperatively. To help address and prevent future ACL failures, new repair and reconstruction techniques have been employed that incorporate suture augmentation. The goal of augmentation is to protect the newly repaired or reconstructed ligament during rehabilitation. Despite advances in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgical techniques and rehabilitation, recent studies report that between 20% to 50% of those with ACL reconstruction do not return to the same sports after surgery and 10% to 70% of those who resume preinjury sports participate at a reduced level or with significant functional impairments. Anecdotal evidence from patient report and clinical observation suggests that an inability to return to sports after ACL reconstruction can be partially attributed to a fear of reinjuring the knee.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05270551,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05270551,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05270551&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

This prospective, randomized controlled trial aims to provide data comparing both grafts regarding the functional outcome. Materials and methods: A two centre trial involving symptomatic patients 18 years of age or older with an anterior cruciate ligament tear was conducted. We randomly assigned 27 patients to quadruple hamstring tendon reconstruction and 24 to quadriceps tendon reconstruction. The patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-surgery. The primary outcome parameter was the side-to-side knee laxity measured with an arthrometer. Secondary outcomes included results in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm Scores and isokinetic testing of strength in knee extension and flexion. Results: Forty-four patients (86%) completed the 2-year follow-up. There was significantly improved knee stability at all time intervals with no difference between the two study groups. The manual side-to-side displacement improved by 4.7 ± 3.0 mm in patients with hamstring tendon reconstruction and 5.5 ± 2.9 mm in patients with quadriceps tendon reconstruction. In addition, muscle strength and outcome scores (IKDC and Lysholm Score) did not show any differences between the hamstring tendon group and the quadriceps tendon group. Patients in the hamstring tendon group returned to their pre-injury activity level after 95.2 ± 45.5 days while patients in the quadriceps tendon group needed 82.1 ± 45.6 days.

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that patients who underwent bridge-enhanced ACL restoration (BEAR) would have higher levels of psychological readiness to return to sport compared with patients who underwent ACLR. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 100 patients (median age, 17 years; median preoperative Marx activity score, 16) with complete midsubstance ACL injuries were randomized to either the BEAR procedure (n = 65) or autograft ACLR (n = 35 [33 hamstring and 2 bone--patellar tendon—bone]) and underwent surgery within 45 days of injury. Objective, functional, and patient-reported outcomes, including the ACL--Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale, were assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Results: Patients who underwent the BEAR procedure had significantly higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months compared with those who underwent ACLR (71.1 vs 58.2; P =.008); scores were similar at 12 and 24 months. Baseline factors independently predictive of higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months were having a BEAR procedure and participating in level 1 sports prior to injury, explaining 15% of the variability in the scores. Regression analysis of baseline and 6-month outcomes as predictors indicated that the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 6 months explained 45% of the 6-month ACL-RSI variance. Subsequent analysis with IKDC excluded from the model indicated that decreased pain, increased hamstring and quadriceps strength in the surgical limb, and decreased side-to-side difference in anteroposterior knee laxity were significant predictors of a higher ACL-RSI score at 6 months, explaining 34% of the variability in scores. Higher ACL-RSI score at 6 months was associated with earlier clearance to return to sports. Conclusion: Patients who underwent the BEAR procedure had higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months postoperatively. Better ACL-RSI scores at 6 months were related most strongly to higher IKDC scores at 6 months and were also associated with lower pain levels, better muscle recovery, and less knee laxity at 6 months.

Effects of the application of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on the anatomic anterior ligament reconstruction were examined. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 40 patients who underwent a surgery between 2012 and 2014 were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomised into two groups: the group with PRF application (n=20) and the group without PRF application (n=20, control group). The study included 11 women and 29 men, with the mean age at the time of inclusion into the study 29.1 years. Vivostat ® PRF was obtained perioperatively from the patient s blood and applied intraoperatively to the hamstring tendon graft. The ACL graft healing was assessed through magnetic resonance (MRI) at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The clinical outcomes (the Lysholm score and the IKDC Subjective score, return to pre-injury sport levels, Pivot-shift test, graft failure) as well as standardised laxity measurements using GenouRob arthrometer were performed preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS The study was completed by thirty-three (33) patients (17 in the PRF group and 16 in the control group). In two cases, postoperative graft failure was reported (both cases in the control group). No significant differences were found in the process of graft ligamentization evaluated through MRI (p=0.07). No significant difference between the groups was identified with respect to return to pre-injury sport levels (p=0.232), or the Lysholm score and IKDC Subjective score (p=0.259, and p=0.364 respectively). The postoperative knee laxity measurement using Genourob arthrometer did not reveal any significant differences between the PRF group and the control group. DISCUSSION Results similar to those arrived at by our study have recently been published also by other authors worldwide. We can therefore assume that the application of PRF can be of benefit, especially at the early stage of healing. The results still need to be verified on a larger study group, the study design should focus on the development in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS In our study group, no significant difference was observed in the evaluated subjective and objective clinical parameters. Only the parameter regarding the ACL graft failure fell just short of statistical significance, namely to the disadvantage of the group without the PRF application.",,,,Czech,English,,36055668,L2019015352,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2019015352&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=00015415&id=doi:&atitle=Clinical+Outcomes+of+the+Application+of+Platelet-Rich+Fibrin+during+Anatomic+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction%3A+Results+of+Prospective+Randomised+Study&stitle=Acta+Chir.+Orthop.+Traumatol.+Cech.&title=Acta+Chirurgiae+Orthopaedicae+et+Traumatologiae+Cechoslovaca&volume=89&issue=4&spage=279&epage=285&aulast=Kasl&aufirst=&auinit=J.&aufull=Kasl+J.&coden=ACOTA&isbn=&pages=279-285&date=2022&auinit1=J&auinitm=,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Aim: To assess the effects of ACL reconstruction with Endbutton femoral fixation versus Endbutton with a bone plug on femoral tunnel widening. Methods: At the faculty of medicine, Cairo University (Kasr Al Aini), and AL Haram hospital, a prospective blind controlled randomized trial was performed from February 2017 to April 2019 to evaluate two cohorts of patients. Cohort A (standard cohort) involved 20 patients with ACL reconstruction by an ipsilateral hamstring autograft with Endbutton femoral fixation. Cohort B (plug cohort) involved 20 patients with ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral hamstring autograft with the addition of a bone plug placed in the femoral tunnel. Results: We involved 40 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction surgery. Cohort A involved 20 patients who underwent the surgery using an ipsilateral hamstring autograft with end button femoral fixation. While cohort B underwent the surgery using an ipsilateral hamstring autograft with end button femoral fixation. The mean age in cohort A was 23.2 while the mean age in cohort B was 23.9. Conclusion: We reported that every ACL repair involved tunnel widening as a fixed finding. In comparison to a cohort without a bone plug, the use of autologous bone plugs next to the hamstring graft after ACL repair did not decrease femoral tunnel widening, according to the analysis of the postoperative radiological study. But it's still uncertain if this phenomenon has any therapeutic implications.",,,,English,English,,,L2022163258,10.47750/pnr.2022.13.S09.975,http://dx.doi.org/10.47750/pnr.2022.13.S09.975,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2022163258&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=22297723&id=doi:10.47750%2Fpnr.2022.13.S09.975&atitle=Autologous+Bone+Effects+On+Femoral+Tunnel+Widening+In+Hamstring+Acl+Reconstruction&stitle=J.+Pharm.+Negat.+Results&title=Journal+of+Pharmaceutical+Negative+Results&volume=13&issue=&spage=8301&epage=8315&aulast=Amr&aufirst=Amr+Mostafa&auinit=A.M.&aufull=Amr+A.M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=8301-8315&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=M,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The reconstruction was done either using hamstring tendon autograft or patellar tendon autograft. Study design: A randomized controlled trial Place and Duration This study was conducted in KMC Hospital Khairpur from April 2021 to April 2022. Methodology: Overall, 40 participants were involved in this research. These patients underwent the reconstruction of a single-incision ACL. These patients were either having a doubled gracilis autograft/hamstring autograft (HS) or a patellar tendon-bone autograft (PT). An accelerated rehabilitation protocol was provided to the patients after the surgery. All the participants were reviewed 3 times after the surgery; after two weeks, after eight weeks, and after four months. The existence and seriousness of anterior knee pain as well as the severity and location of general knee pain was measured in each review. Moreover, the passive and active flexion, size and existence of an effusion, and passive extension deficits were also reviewed. Results: At the review two weeks after the surgery, it was seen that the people in the PT batch were complaining about anterior knee pain. At the review on eight weeks after the surgery, no necessary difference was seen between the 2 batches. At the review four months after the operation, people in the PT batch showed greater occurrence of pain on kneeling and high severity of general pain. The quadriceps peak torque deficit was at 240° in the PT batch, which is also high. The score of Cincinnati sport activity was more in the PT batch while the HS batch showed higher IKDC scores.

Recently, there has been renewed interest in repairing the ACL in selected patients with a proximally torn ligament. Repair of the ligament has (potential) advantages over reconstruction of the ligament such as decreased surgical morbidity, faster return of range of motion, and potentially decreased awareness of the knee. Studies comparing both treatments in a prospective randomized method are currently lacking. Methods: This study is a multicenter prospective block randomized controlled trial. A total of 74 patients with acute proximal isolated ACL tears will be assigned in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either (I) ACL repair using cortical button fixation and additional suture augmentation or (II) ACL reconstruction using an all-inside autologous hamstring graft technique. The primary objective is to assess if ACL repair is non-inferior to ACL reconstruction regarding the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at two-years postoperatively. The secondary objectives are to assess if ACL repair is non-inferior with regards to (I) other patient-reported outcomes measures (i.e. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm score, Forgotten Joint Score, patient satisfaction and pain), (II) objective outcome measures (i.e. failure of repair or graft defined as rerupture or symptomatic instability, reoperation, contralateral injury, and stability using the objective IKDC score and Rollimeter/KT-2000), (III) return to sports assessed by Tegner activity score and the ACL-Return to Sports Index at two-year follow-up, and (IV) long-term osteoarthritis at 10-year follow-up. Discussion: Over the last decade there has been a resurgence of interest in repair of proximally torn ACLs. Several cohort studies have shown encouraging short-term and mid-term results using these techniques, but prospective randomized studies are lacking. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial has been designed to assess whether ACL repair is at least equivalent to the current gold standard of ACL reconstruction in both subjective and objective outcome scores.

Neuromuscular training programs appear to be effective for reducing high-risk landing mechanics and preventing primary ACL injuries; however, there have been few attempts to examine their effects in athletes who have undergone ACL reconstruction. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of a neuromuscular training program that emphasizes external focus of attention cuing on biomechanics, knee proprioception, and patient-reported function in athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction and completed conventional post-operative rehabilitation. Methods: Twenty-four male athletes who had undergone primary, unilateral, hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction and completed conventional post-operative rehabilitation were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n = 12) who took part in an 8-week neuromuscular training program or a control group (n = 12) who continued a placebo program. The neuromuscular training program included lower extremity strengthening and plyometric exercises, balance training, and movement pattern re-training. Biomechanics during single-leg landing, knee proprioception, and patient-reported function were assessed before and after the 8-week training period. Results: Athletes in the experimental group demonstrated increased trunk, hip, and knee flexion angles and decreased knee abduction, internal rotation angles and knee valgus during landing following the intervention. Further, the experimental group decreased their peak knee extension and abduction moments and vertical ground reaction force on landing post-intervention. International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaire (IKDC) scores increased in the experimental group following training. The control group demonstrated no changes in any variable over the same time period. Conclusions: Neuromuscular training with external focus of attention cueing improved landing biomechanics in patients after ACL reconstruction. Neuromuscular training programs beneficially mitigate second ACL injury risk factors and should be emphasized during and after traditional post-operative rehabilitation.

Elastic knee sleeves may be useful adjuncts to rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to determine the immediate and 6-week effects of wearing a knee sleeve on person-reported outcomes and function in participants who had undergone an ACL reconstruction and who had residual self-reported functional limitations. Methods: Individuals with ACL reconstruction in the previous 6 months to 5 years were recruited. Immediate effects of a commercially-available elastic knee sleeve on single-leg horizontal hop distance were explored using a cross-over design. Following this first session, participants were randomised into a Control Group and a Sleeve Group who wore the sleeve for 6 weeks, at least 1 h daily. Outcome measures for the randomised clinical trial (RCT) were the International Knee Documentation Classification Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) score, the single-leg horizontal hop distance, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring peak torque. Linear mixed models were used to determine random effects. Where both limbs were measured at multiple time points, a random measurement occasion effect nested within participant was used. Results: Thirty-four individuals (16 women) with ACL reconstruction completed the cross-over trial. Hop distance for the injured side during the sleeve condition increased by 3.6 % (95 % CI 0.4–6.8 %, p = 0.025). There was no evidence of differential changes between groups for the IKDC-SKF (Sleeve Group n = 15; Control Group n = 16; p = 0.327), or relative improvement in the injured side compared to the uninjured side for the physical performance measures (Sleeve Group n = 12, Control Group n = 12; three-way interaction p = 0.533 [hop distance], 0.381 [quadriceps isokinetic peak torque], and 0.592 [hamstring isokinetic peak torque]). Conclusions: Single-leg hop distance of the ACL reconstructed side improved when wearing a knee sleeve. Wearing the knee sleeve over 6 weeks did not lead to enhanced improvements in self-reported knee function, hop distance and thigh muscle strength compared to the control group.

In this technique, a cortical suspensory fixation of graft is used on the femoral side and interference screw fixation on the tibial side using a complete bone tunnel. All-inside translateral technique is a recently introduced technique which uses a closed loop of quadrupled semitendinosus graft with an adjustable cortical suspensory fixation on both sides allowing optimum tensioning of graft and near-complete filling of retrosockets created by the flip cutter on both femoral and tibial sides. With its proposed but unproven benefits, our study was planned to compare the two techniques. Methods: A total of 80 young active males requiring ACL reconstruction surgery were equally randomized to AMP and All-inside technique. The primary objective of the study was to compare the ability to return to pre-injury level of activity using Tegner activity scale and patient-reported outcome using new Knee Society Score (KSS) at two years of follow-up. Results: The mean improvement in Tegner score was significantly better (p = 0.0005) in all-inside group (2.34 ± 0.97) as compared to AMP group (1.5 ± 1.30). Among components of new KSS, patient satisfaction was better in all-inside group.

Methods: After we performed prospective power analysis and obtained institutional review board, 70 patients with ACL rupture were block randomized to the expandable or suspensory femoral fixation group (35 in each group). All patients received autologous hamstring autograft through the anteromedial portal and fixed with a sheath-screw system in the tibia. The primary outcome measures were anteroposterior knee stability at 2 years’ follow-up measured using the KT-1000 arthrometer and the degree of femoral and tibial tunnels’ widening measured by the use of computed tomography imaging performed immediately postoperative and 12 months postsurgery. Secondary outcome measures included pain score on a visual analog scale, the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 assessment form, the Lysholm score, and the Tegner activity scale at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Results: Twenty-four patients were excluded from further analysis, leaving a total of 48 patients (24 in each group) for the final evaluation. The anteroposterior knee stability (KT-1000) showed no difference between groups at 24 months’ follow-up (P =.31). The percentile widening (%) of femoral and tibial tunnel at 1-year follow-up showed no difference also, except for greater values at the tibial coronal point T2 (P =.065) and tibial sagittal point T1 (P =.033) in the group of cortical buttons. Secondary clinical outcomes showed no statistical differences between groups at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months’ postoperatively. Numerical pain scale (visual analog scale) was similar in both groups except for postoperative day 7, where the AperFix group showed better results (P =.014).

The Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) knee group has developed an autograft risk calculator that uses patient characteristics and lifestyle to predict the probability of graft rupture if the surgeon uses a hamstring tendon (HT) or a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft to reconstruct the ligament. If validated, this risk calculator can be used during the shared decision-making process to make optimal ACLR autograft choices and reduce rupture rates. The STABILITY 1 randomized clinical trial offers a large, rigorously collected data set of similar young active patients who received HT autograft with or without lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) for ACLR. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose was to validate the ACLR graft rupture risk calculator in a large external data set and to investigate the utility of BPTB and LET for ACLR. We hypothesized that the risk calculator would maintain adequate discriminative ability and calibration in the external STABILITY 1 data set when compared with the initial MOON development data set. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: The model predictors for the risk calculator include age, sex, body mass index, sport played at the time of injury, Marx Activity Score, preoperative knee laxity, and graft type. The STABILITY 1 trial data set was used for external validation. Discriminative ability, calibration, and diagnostic test validity of the model were assessed. Finally, predictor strength in the initial and validation samples was compared. RESULTS: The model showed acceptable discriminative ability (area under the curve = 0.73), calibration (Brier score = 0.07), and specificity (85.3%) to detect patients who will experience a graft rupture. Age, high-grade preoperative knee laxity, and graft type were significant predictors of graft rupture in young active patients. BPTB and the addition of LET to HT were protective against graft rupture versus HT autograft alone. CONCLUSION: The MOON risk calculator is a valid predictor of ACLR graft rupture and is appropriate for clinical practice. This study provides evidence supporting the idea that isolated HT autografts should be avoided for young active patients undergoing ACLR.

One parameter thought to affect PTOA risk is the initial graft tension. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to compare outcomes between two graft tensioning protocols that bracket the range commonly used. At 7 years postsurgery, we determined that most outcomes between the two tension groups were not significantly different, that they were inferior to an uninjured matched control group, and that PTOA was progressing in both groups relative to controls. The trial database was also leveraged to gain insight into mechanisms of PTOA following ACL injury. We determined that the inflammatory response at the time of injury undermines one of the joint's lubricating mechanisms. We learned that patients continue to protect their surgical knee 5 years postinjury compared to controls during a jump-pivot activity. We also established that presurgical knee function and mental health were correlated with symptomatic PTOA at 7 years, that there were specific anatomical factors associated with poor outcomes, and that there were no changes in outcomes due to tunnel widening in patients receiving hamstring tendon autografts. We also validated a magnetic resonance imaging technique to noninvasively assess graft strength. In conclusion, the RCT determined that initial graft tensioning does not have a major influence on 7-year outcomes. Therefore, surgeons can reconstruct the ACL using a graft tensioning protocol that is within the window of the two graft tensioning techniques evaluated in this RCT.",,,,English,English,,32639610,L2005608662,10.1002/jor.24794,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jor.24794,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2005608662&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=1554527X&id=doi:10.1002%2Fjor.24794&atitle=Long-term+outcomes+of+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction+surgery%3A+2020+OREF+clinical+research+award+paper&stitle=J.+Orthop.+Res.&title=Journal+of+Orthopaedic+Research&volume=39&issue=5&spage=1041&epage=1051&aulast=Fleming&aufirst=Braden+C.&auinit=B.C.&aufull=Fleming+B.C.&coden=JORED&isbn=&pages=1041-1051&date=2021&auinit1=B&auinitm=C,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The aim of this study was to compare bilateral muscle co-contraction indices, time to peak ground reaction force, and timing of muscle onset between anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction subjects 10–15 years post reconstruction with those of matched uninjured controls during a one-leg hop landing. Methods: Nine healthy controls and 9 reconstruction subjects were recruited. Clinical and functional knee exams were administered. Lower limb co-contraction indices, time to peak ground reaction force, and muscle onset times were measured bilaterally. Differences in clinical and functional outcomes were assessed with unpaired t-tests, and mixed model repeated measures were used to examine effects of group, limb and interaction terms in electromyography measures. Findings: 89% of control knees were clinically “normal”, whereas only 33% of reconstructed knees were “normal”. Anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed subjects tended to achieve shorter functional hop distances but demonstrated symmetrical lower limb electromyography measures that were no different from those of controls' with the exception that biceps femoris activation was delayed bilaterally prior to ground contact but was greater during the injury risk phase of landing. Interpretation: With the exception of hamstring activation, lower limb electromyography measures were largely similar between ligament-reconstructed and matched control subjects, which was in contrast to the clinical findings.

The following variables were also evaluated postoperatively: return to soccer, level at return, graft rerupture, postoperative complications, anterior knee pain, patellar tendinitis, difficulty sprinting, and loss of kicking power. Results: The PT and HT groups were homogenous in terms of age, sex distribution, injured side, and time from injury to surgery, and there was no difference between them on any preoperative outcome score. At 2 years postoperatively, there were no differences between the groups on any outcome score; however, there were significantly fewer patients with anterior knee pain in the HT group compared with the PT group (7 [22.6%] vs 15 [48.4%], respectively; P =.03). Two patients from each group (2/31; 6.5%) sustained rerupture. Conclusion: There were no differences between soccer players who underwent different types of ACL reconstruction with the exception of anterior knee pain, which was more frequent in players who underwent reconstruction with PT graft.

Injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is the most common ligament injury that requires operative treatment. So far, multiple ACL reconstruction (ACLR) techniques using a variety of graft types and implants that fixate the grafts have been described. The aim of the study was to compare two different ACLR techniques using two implant types for suspensory graft fixation in the femoral tunnel. Methods. This randomized-prospective study encompassed 60 patients/subjects who underwent ACLR in the period between January 2015 and December 2017 at the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology of Military Hospital “Dr Vladan Djordjević” Niš. The ACLR in all patients included in the study was performed using a quadruple semitendinosus-gracilis (STG) graft with two types of suspensory fixation on the lateral femoral cortex, whereas the graft fixation in the tibial tunnel was performed using an osteoconductive bioresorbable screw. The post-operative knee stability was assessed 24 months after surgery using the Lachman test and the lateral pivot shift test, as well as the KT-1000 arthrometer test. Results. In patients whose graft was fixated using a fixed-length loop implant, the mean post-surgery knee stability, measured with the KT-1000, was 1.167 ± 0.780; in patients whose graft was fixated using an adjustable-length loop implant, the mean value of the KT-1000 was 1.100 ± 0.894 (p = 0.605). The mean post-surgery International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score for the fixed-length loop group was 84.887 ± 9.0207, while for the adjustable-length loop the score was 88.327 ± 7.302. The mean Lysholm score was 93.50 ± 6.872 for the fixed-length loop group of patients and 94.00 ± 5.527 for the adjustable-length loop group of patients. Conclusion. Both types of implants can be used with success during ACLR, because the functional results of operative treatment using both implants were identical after surgery.",titanium (7440-32-6),,,English,"English, Bosnian",,,L2015705181,10.2298/VSP200128026D,http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/VSP200128026D,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2015705181&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=24060720&id=doi:10.2298%2FVSP200128026D&atitle=Application+of+two+types+of+suspensory+fixation+in+reconstruction+of+anterior+cruciate+ligament+with+a+semitendinosus-gracilis+graft+%E2%80%93+A+randomized+prospective+study&stitle=Vojnosanit.+Pregl.&title=Vojnosanitetski+Pregled&volume=78&issue=10&spage=1053&epage=1059&aulast=Djordjevi%C4%87&aufirst=Du%C5%A1an&auinit=D.&aufull=Djordjevi%C4%87+D.&coden=VSPRA&isbn=&pages=1053-1059&date=2021&auinit1=D&auinitm=,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

In the acute setting, proximal ACL tears and femoral avulsions of the ACL are good indications for primary repair of the ACL. However, literature shows a wide range of failure rates. An intact synovial membrane seems to be a predicational factor for the outcome of primary ACL repair. Disruption of the synovial membrane is associated with higher failure rates. We describe a surgical technique repairing the ACL in combination with a semitendinosus augmentation for proximal ACL tears with or without disruption of the synovial membrane. MATERIAL AND METHODS The procedure preserves as much of the original anatomy as possible by repairing the synovial membrane and ACL remnant to the femoral origin. To accomplish this, we have built on the so-called “Single Anteromedial Bundle Biological Augmentation (SAMBBA) technique” and developed it further to the “Single Anteromedial Bundle Biological Augmentation and Refixation (SAMBBAR) technique”, which we firstly describe here. RESULTS All three patients treated with the SAMBBAR technique showed very good short-term clinical outcomes comparable with successful standard ACL reconstruction. There were no complications. Twelve months postoperatively, patients had no pain. They had normal range of motion in the affected knee without any signs of instability. DISCUSSION The SAMBBAR technique seems to be an adequate procedure to preserve as much proprioceptive native tissue as possible, while at the same time ensuring high tissue strength in order to reduce failure rates. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to compare the new SAMBBAR technique with standard ACL reconstruction, with the original SAMBBA technique, and with techniques of ACL refixation. CONCLUSIONS With the presented surgical procedure, it is possible to perform a standard ACL reconstruction using an autologous semitendinosus graft and at the same time preserving the tissue remnant of the ACL in all proximal tear patterns. This might contribute to improved proprioception and rehabilitation without sacrificing stability.",,,,English,English,,34998445,L2017379457,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2017379457&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=00015415&id=doi:&atitle=Combining+ACL+Reconstruction+and+Refixation%3A+the+Single+Anteromedial+Bundle+Biological+Augmentation+and+Refixation+%28SAMBBAR%29+Technique&stitle=Acta+Chir.+Orthop.+Traumatol.+Cech.&title=Acta+Chirurgiae+Orthopaedicae+et+Traumatologiae+Cechoslovaca&volume=88&issue=6&spage=423&epage=427&aulast=D%C3%B6bele&aufirst=&auinit=S.&aufull=D%C3%B6bele+S.&coden=ACOTA&isbn=&pages=423-427&date=2021&auinit1=S&auinitm=,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 63 patients (36 males, 27 females; mean age 27.8±4.0; range, 19 to 35 years) who had unilateral ACL injury and participated in pivoting sports and were randomly assigned to undergo either isolated ACL reconstruction (Group 1, n=33) or combined ACL reconstruction and ALL STA (Group 2, n=30) between January 2015 and February 2018. The presence of an associated meniscal injury, chondral pathology, contralateral ACL rupture, and residual pivot shift; subjective and objective International Knee Documentation Committee scores; Cincinnati and Lysholm functional scores; KT-1000 measurements; and graft rupture rate were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a minimum of two years. The groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, side, time from injury to surgery, postoperative follow-up time, ACL graft size, contralateral ACL rupture, graft size, partial meniscectomy, chondral pathology or preoperative physical examination results. A total of 9.1% of the patients in Group 1 and 0% of those in Group 2 presented postoperative positive pivot shift (p=0.357). The graft failure rate was 6.06% (n=2) in Group 1 and 0% in Group 2 (p=0.270). In the final evaluation, compared with Group 1, Group 2 showed better anteroposterior clinical stability, as evaluated by KT-1000 arthrometry (p=0.006). Although better results were observed in Group 2, the clinical evaluation results for postoperative function did not differ significantly between groups.

In today's world, due to developing sports industry , the increase in sports traumas of both genders and ages ACL injuries and treatments are given major priority. The success of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction depends on many factors, including the mechanical properties of the graft, positioning of the proper femoral and tibial tunnel, fixation methods and the postoperative rehabilitation. The tendon grafts can be fixed on the femoral side using several fixation devices, including cortical suspension devices, cross pins, and interference screws. Femoral fixation via Cortical button in a suture loop provides the highest primary stability, and therefore, has become increasingly popular among orthopaedic surgeons. Adjustable and fixed Femoral cortical loops are commonly used for femoral fixation. In this sudy we aimed to compare clinical and functional outcomes of three different techniques of suspensory femoral fixation in ACL reconstruction.Detailed DescriptionThis study has been planned as a prospective randomized clinical trial. We used a completely computer-generated list in order to randomize all participants to receive one of two treatments (www.random.org/sequences/). Anterior Cruciate Ligament tear diagnosis will be made by physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. Participants who agree to be enrolled to study will be examined one day prior to surgery. Patients are randomly divided into 3 groups, after tibial fixation of the hamstring autograft, 3 different techniques will be used in the femoral fixation phase. The first group will be without knotting and retensioning the graft. In the second group, The graft will be retensioned after tibial fixation. In the third group femoral loop will be retensioned and knotted after tibial fixation. All the surgeries will be performed by the same senior surgeon experienced in sports medicine surgery under regional anesthesia with patient in supine position. All participants will receive a standard postoperative rehabilitation program starting immediately after surgery with closed chain exercises and quadriceps strengthening and walking. The operated lower extremity won't be placed in a brace and patient allowed for full weight walking with a pair of crutches. Postoperative evaluations will be performed regularly at 12 months postoperatively . To assess knee stability, KT-1000 measurement will be applied to both extremities in each group and clinical scores ( lysholm knee score, IKDC ) will be measured. Furthermore, to evaluate flexor and extensor muscle group around knee, isokinetic tests will be applied to patients in sitting position to analyse peak torque and total work done values.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT04677218,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04677218,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT04677218&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

"Effect of Knee Instability Due To Rupture Of Anterior Cruciate Ligament On Cartilage Damage Related To Types of Reconstruction Therapy: In Biomechanic, Biomolecular and Radiological Aspects",,,,,,5/31/2025,5/31/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2020). Date of Publication: 22 Oct 2020,clinicaltrials.gov,2020,,,,,22-Oct-20,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe prevalence of ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) ruptures is relatively high, primarily due to sports and military training injuries. With the advancements of ACL reconstruction therapies, there exist two ways to reconstruct ACL: single-bundle ACL reconstruction (SBACLR) and double-bundle ACL reconstruction (DBACLR). Previous research studies claimed that DBACLR techniques are superior to that of SBACLR, while others stated no notable differences between the two. The variables assessed in previous studies are findings related to the clinical instabilities of the knees (both subjective nor objectives views) and standard radiology examination, such as Xray or MRI. Knee instabilities are the primary goal of ACL reconstructions. Hence this study focuses on finding the dissimilarities between the two previously mentioned techniques by observing the early consequences (subclinically) of knee instabilities towards cartilage damage. The dissimilarities assessments utilize biomolecular tests (ELISA) of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) on synovial joint fluid of the knee and knee joint cartilage examination using MRI T2 mapping. Furthermore, there will be a stability (biomechanical) check of the knee joint in the form of a Lachman test, a pivot shift test, and a Rolimeter. This study requires around 47-52 subjects divided into two operation techniques of SBACLR and DBACLR. To evaluate the results from COMP, MRI T2 mapping, Lachman test, pivot shift test, and Rolimeter, this study is divided into three timeframes: before an operation, three months after post-operation, and six months post-operations. The differences between the test variables are then used as an indicator to assess the cartilage conditions from two operation techniques: SBACLR and DBACLR. Subsequently, the study also examines the possible correlation of each of the resulting variables.Detailed DescriptionThis study utilizes a single-blind randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether the DBACL reconstruction surgery is more suitable than SBACL reconstruction in the subclinical aspect of cartilage damage through a biomolecular examination from the synovial joint fluid COMP and MRI T2 mapping. This study's estimated time is between two to three years ranging from January 2018 until the end of June 2021. The samples are randomly divided into two groups: the SBACLR group and the DBACLR group. The sample size for each group was 26 subjects. For the subjects, the accepted inclusion criteria were male, age 18-40 years, total primary AC rupture, injury time 1-12 months, willingness to attend the study, and signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria include subjects having other ligament injuries in the knee, history of rheumatoid arthritis, severe osteoarthritis Kellgren-Lawrence grading\> 2, Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 25, fracture around the knee joint or osteochondral avulsion, history of injury with either or both semitendinosus or gracilis muscle, patellofemoral instability, contraindication of anesthesia, and partial ACL rupture. Drop Out criteria includes: subjects not returning to control, undergoing treatment outside the program, not complying with study protocols, re-injury to the studied knee causing ligament, meniscus or cartilage injury, and postoperative knee infection. Prospective subjects have been diagnosed with the total loss of ACL and meet the research criteria are explained about the aims and objectives of the study and sign a consent form to participate in the study. Each subject was assigned to one of the study groups through a simple randomization method: the SBACL reconstruction surgery action group or the DBACL reconstruction surgery action group.

PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical outcomes and maturity of different segments using insertion-preserved and free hamstring tendon autografts up to 5 years after ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: 45 patients who underwent isolated ACLR with hamstring tendon autografts were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups. The study group had ACLR with IP-HT, whereas the control group had ACLR with FHT. The International Knee Documentation Committee and Tegner scores, Lysholm activity score, and KT-1000 arthrometer measurements were evaluated preoperatively and at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months postoperatively. Three-dimensional-reconstruction MRI examinations were performed at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months to evaluate the signal/noise quotient (SNQ) values of femoral tunnel graft, intra-articular graft, and tibial tunnel graft. RESULTS: At 60 months, the SNQ values of the intra-articular and tunnel sections for the grafts in both groups showed no difference; the clinical outcomes were improved compared with before surgery (P < .001) and were similar in both groups. In the early stage, all graft segments in the IP-HT group had lower SNQ values than those of the FHT group. At 6 months, the entire graft in the FHT group and the femoral tunnel section in the IP-HT group had the maximum SNQ values, whereas the femoral tunnel graft had the highest SNQ value compared with intra-articular and tibial tunnel graft in each group. SNQ values of the intra-articular and tibial tunnel graft in the IP-HT group had no significant change within 60 months. CONCLUSION: All patients had similar clinical outcomes and graft maturity at 60 months postoperatively. The SNQ values and progressions varied at different graft sites and were highest for the femoral tunnel graft. All significantly changing SNQ values reached the maximum value at 6 months.

The Use of Five-strand Hamstring Autograft to Increase the Graft Size in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction - a Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,5/22/2025,5/22/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2020). Date of Publication: 26 Aug 2020,clinicaltrials.gov,2020,,,,,26-Aug-20,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one of most commonly performed orthopaedic surgeries. Several options for graft choice are available and autologous single bundle hamstring graft is most commonly used. Variability exists among patients in terms of hamstring size, and therefore the graft diameter. Recently there has been an increasing amount of literature correlating the hamstring graft diameter with the graft failure rate \[1-4\]. They concluded that graft exceeding 8mm in diameter is associated with a significant lower risk of graft failure. There has been study showing that Asian patients were indeed 'different' from the Caucasians. Ho et al published his findings on Singaporean patients showing that the median graft diameters for female and male patients were 7mm and 8mm respectively \[5\]. A retrospective review our patients undergoing ACL reconstruction in our department over the past 10 years has shown that the mean graft diameter was 7.8mm (range, 5.5-10mm). The conventional way of four-strand hamstring autograft is done by doubling both the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons to provide a quadrupled graft. Several techniques have been described to increase the size of the hamstring graft. One of those is the -strand hamstring graft, in which the longer semitendinosus tendon is tripled with the shorter gracilis tendon doubled to produce a 5-strand configuration. We hypothesized that the 5-strand hamstring graft would provide a graft of significantly larger diameter than the conventional quadrupled autograft.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT04531826,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04531826,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT04531826&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Follow-up was 2 years. METHODS: Patients older than 16 years who underwent primary isolated ACLR included for 1 year until August 2017 were eligible. The primary outcome measures were the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, isokinetic muscle strength recovery, and return to work within 2 years. The study was approved by the ethics committee. RESULTS: Of 66 eligible patients, 60 completed the study and were included, 33 in the 4ST group and 27 in the ST/G group. Mean age was 30.5 ± 8.9 years in the 4ST group and 30.3 ± 8.5 in the ST/G group (n.s.). No significant between-group differences were found for mean postoperative subjective IKDC (4ST group, 80.2 ± 12.5; ST/G group, 83.6 ± 13.6; n.s.), side-to-side percentage deficits in isokinetic hamstring strength (at 60°/s: ST group, 17% ± 16%; ST/G group, 14% ± 11%; n.s.) or quadriceps strength (at 60°/s: ST group, 14% ± 12%; ST/G group, 19% ± 17%; n.s.), return to work, pain during physical activities, side-to-side differential laxity, balance, loss of flexion/extension, or surgical complications. CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrates that functional outcomes after 4ST for ACLR with cortical fixations could be as good, although not better, than those obtained using ST/G. The 4ST technique spares the gracilis tendon, which thus preserves the medial sided muscle and thereby could improve function and limit donor-side morbidity.Level I.",,,,English,English,,32699919,L632423976,10.1007/s00167-020-06121-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-06121-2,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L632423976&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14337347&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-020-06121-2&atitle=ACL+reconstruction+using+a+quadruple+semitendinosus+graft+with+cortical+fixations+gives+suitable+isokinetic+and+clinical+outcomes+after+2%C2%A0years&stitle=Knee+Surg+Sports+Traumatol+Arthrosc&title=Knee+surgery%2C+sports+traumatology%2C+arthroscopy+%3A+official+journal+of+the+ESSKA&volume=28&issue=8&spage=2468&epage=2477&aulast=Roger&aufirst=Julien&auinit=J.&aufull=Roger+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2468-2477&date=2020&auinit1=J&auinitm=,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"

The increasing incidence and proper management has become a point of interest in the musculoskeletal sport injury. Choosing the best graft has become the main focus in searching for a better outcome regarding ACL reconstruction in these patient population. Currently, single bundle hamstring tendon (SBHT) autograft was preferred in Asian population compared to bone quadriceps tendon (BQT) autograft. However, there are some problems such as smaller size, as well as diameter, of SBHT. This study is focused on evaluation of the clinical outcome between BQT and SBHT in arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstruction patients.Detailed DescriptionIn this prospective cohort study, 30 subjects were divided into 2 groups (BQT and SBHT). Sampling was taken between February 2016-2017 (1 year) in one orthopaedic center. The instruments used for evaluation are rolimeter and PRO questionnaires (IKDC, Tegner-Lysholm, and KOOS) with data mining between 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post operation.

Subjects were randomly divided into two groups following their inclusion in the study. One group underwent the normal ACL rehab protocol as determined by the participating surgeons. The study group underwent normal ACL rehab modified by use of a tourniquet for blood flow restriction during selected exercises.Detailed DescriptionOn the day of the procedure, the surgeon will measure the subject's thigh circumference 1/3 distance from the superior pole of the patella to the inguinal crease. The subject will then undergo the normal BTB autograft ACL reconstruction procedure. A subject will be excluded from the study if a meniscal repair is performed. At the subject's two week post-operative clinic visit, the physician will measure thigh circumference at 1/3 distance from the superior pole of the patella to the inguinal crease. Study group subjects will begin physical therapy instructed BFR exercises at two weeks post operatively. Study group subjects will be taken through normal ACL rehab protocol as well as BFR exercises. Control group subjects will do the same exercises and formal physical therapy rehab protocol as the study group without BFR. The BFR exercises will consist of: bilateral leg press week 3-10, eccentric leg press weeks 4-10, hamstring curl week 4-6, eccentric hamstring curl weeks 7-10, straight leg press weeks 6-10. The pressure used will be elevated to occluded blood flow by 80% (80% occlusion pressure) which will be determined for each individual subject. Subjects will do exercises at 20% of 1RM in 4 sets of 30-15-15-15 repetitions separated by 30 seconds of rest. Repetition maximum (1RM) will be determined by the contralateral leg, using the greatest amount of weight with full range of motion and proper form. This will be done over three separate tries, separated by one minute breaks. Resistance loads will be adjusted every 2 weeks as strength improves. During the exercise protocol, if patients are unable to complete the prescribed amount of repetitions, rest periods between sets will be increased as needed. The control group will do these exercises without BFR. Both study and control groups will also do the surgeons' standard post-ACL reconstruction physical therapy protocol. Cuff pressures will be determined using the Loenneke et al outline, based off of thigh circumference and estimated cuff pressure for 50% artery occlusion \[19\]. Body composition (DEXA), bone density (DEXA), IKDC and Tegner Lysholm scores will be recorded at first rehabilitation visit, two weeks, eight weeks and 12 weeks following the initiation of rehab (1 wk following surgery).

Purpose: To investigate whether intra-articular (IA) administration of TXA could reduce hemarthrosis and postoperative pain in patients after ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 47 patients were included in this study, which was performed between July 2017 and May 2019. Single-bundle reconstructions using autologous hamstring tendon grafts were performed in all patients. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: the TXA group (received the index procedure with 100-mL IA injection of TXA [30 mg/mL]) and a control group (did not receive IA injection of TXA). No patients received a drain. Blood loss was calculated on the basis of hemoglobin balance at postoperative day (PD) 2. The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain score was assessed at PD 3. The midpatellar circumference was measured at PD 2 and PD 5. Knee range of motion (ROM) was evaluated 6 weeks after surgery. Results: The mean ± SD blood loss was 467 ± 242 mL in the TXA group and 558 ± 236 mL in the control group. No significant differences were found for blood loss (P =.20), VAS pain scores (P =.28), ROM at postoperative week 6 (P =.61), or patellar circumference at PD 2 (P =.75) and PD 5 (P =.84).

Our aim was to investigate the effects of quadriceps tendon autograft (QTB) vs. semitendinosus-gracilis autograft (StG) on thigh muscle strength and functional capacity, and a patient-reported outcome 1 year after ACL-R, and to compare the results to healthy controls. METHODS: ACL-R patients (n = 100) and matched controls (CON, n = 50) were recruited, with patients being randomly assigned to QTB (n = 50) or StG (n = 50) ACL-R. One year after ACL-R, bilateral knee extensor (KE) and flexor (KF) muscle strength (isometric, dynamic, explosive, limb symmetry index [LSI], hamstring:quadriceps ratio [HQ ratio]) were assessed by isokinetic dynamometry, along with functional capacity (single leg hop distance [SHD]) and a patient-reported outcome (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] score). RESULTS: KE muscle strength of the operated leg was lower (9-11%) in QTB vs. StG as was KE LSI, while KF muscle strength was lower (12-17%) in StG vs. QTB as was KF LSI. HQ ratios were lower in StG vs. QTB. Compared with the controls, KE and KF muscle strength were lower in StG (10-22%), while KE muscle strength only was lower in QTB (16-25%). Muscle strength in the StG, QTB, and CON groups was identical in the non-operated leg. While SHD and IKDC did not differ between StG and QTB, SHD in both StG and QTB was lower than CON. The IKDC scores improved significantly 1 year following ACL-R for both graft types. CONCLUSION: One year after ACL-R, muscle strength is affected by autograft type, with StG leading to impairments of KE and KF muscle strength, while QTB results in more pronounced impairments of KE only. Functional capacity and patient-reported outcome were unaffected by autograft type, with the former showing impairment compared to healthy controls.

Methods: Skeletally mature candidates younger than 24 years old with an ACL tear were randomized into either the AIST (n = 32) or BPTB (n = 32) group and were followed for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained at 1-year follow-up, and radiographs were obtained at 2-year follow-up. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using an anteromedial portal to establish the femoral tunnel. The primary outcome measure was KT-1000 stability testing. Secondary outcome measures included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Knee Evaluation Form, IKDC Subjective Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Marx Activity Scale, visual analog pain scale, and SF-12 (Mental and Physical). Results: At 2-year follow-up, no statistical difference existed with KT-1000-measured side-to-side laxity between AIST (0.3 ± 0.7 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.0-1.0 mm) and BPTB (0.0 ± 0.8 mm, confidence interval CI -0.3 to 1.1 mm) (P = .197). In addition, no statistical differences between the groups were found for IKDC Subjective Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Marx, SF-12 Mental, SF-12 Physical, or with regards to imaging findings. Patients with BPTB reported significantly greater postoperative pain scores at days 2 (P = .049), 3 (P = .004), and 7 (P = .015) and had significantly greater kneeling pain at 2 years (P < .019). A return to sport questionnaire at 2 years revealed no significant difference between the groups for returning to preoperative level of sport activity (83% AIST, 74% BPTB; P = .415).

Standard radiographs were available for 45 patients and laximetry (TELOS) for 42 patients. Mean subjective International Knee Documentation Committee score at last follow-up was 81.8, and no differences were noted between the BTB and BTB-LET groups (P = .7). Two-thirds of patients were still participating in pivoting sports. A total of 17 knees (21%) experienced a graft failure, 5 of which (6%) underwent revision ACLR. There was no significant difference in graft failure risk between the BTB group (29%) and the BTB-LET group (13%; P = .1). Lateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis was significantly more frequent in the BTB-LET group (59%) as compared with the BTB group (22%; P = .02). Lateral compartment osteoarthritis was correlated with partial lateral meniscectomy. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in long-term patient-reported outcomes after ACLR with or without an LET. LET may increase the risk of lateral compartment osteoarthritis at long-term follow-up. There was a trend toward decreased graft failure risk with the addition of LET but this study was underpowered to assess this outcome.",,,,English,English,,32368935,L631680237,10.1177/0363546520914936,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546520914936,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L631680237&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546520914936&atitle=A+Randomized+Controlled+Trial+of+Bone-Patellar+Tendon-Bone+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction+With+and+Without+Lateral+Extra-articular+Tenodesis%3A+19-Year+Clinical+and+Radiological+Follow-up&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=48&issue=7&spage=1665&epage=1672&aulast=Castoldi&aufirst=Marie&auinit=M.&aufull=Castoldi+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1665-1672&date=2020&auinit1=M&auinitm=,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"

Recently, the popularity of lateral extra-articular procedures has resurged, warranting an urgent evaluation of their safety profile. Purpose/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to perform an interim analysis of the ongoing SANTI randomized controlled trial to determine whether combined ACL and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ACL + ALLR) is associated with an increased rate of adverse outcomes when compared with isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The hypothesis was that there would be no significant difference between groups at a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Recruitment commenced in November 2016. Patients scheduled for ACLR were randomized to either isolated ACLR (with bone–patellar tendon–bone [BPTB] autograft) or combined ACL + ALLR (with hamstring tendon autograft). All patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year by March 2019 were included. The evaluated parameters included complications and reoperations, knee laxity parameters, range of motion, and scores on the Tegner, Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) instruments. Results: A total of 224 patients (112 in each group) with a mean ± SD follow-up of 12.3 ± 1.9 months (range, 12-19 months) formed the study population. A significantly higher rate of reoperation for cyclops syndrome was noted in the isolated ACLR group compared with the combined ACL + ALLR group (8.9% vs 0%, respectively; P =.0012). No significant differences were found in frequency of graft rupture (ACLR, 5.4%; ACL + ALLR, 0.9%; P =.1191), range of motion deficits, pain, or reoperation for meniscectomy between groups. No cases of postoperative infection, venous thromboembolism, or arthrofibrosis were seen. Subjective IKDC (81.2 vs 86.8; P =.0048), Lysholm (88 vs 92; P =.0131), and some components of the KOOS were significantly better in the combined ACL + ALLR group. Conclusion: This study demonstrates no evidence of an increased risk of short-term adverse events after combined ACL + ALLR compared with isolated ACLR with BPTB graft.

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that patients treated with BEAR would have a noninferior patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] Subjective Score; prespecified noninferiority margin, -11.5 points) and instrumented anteroposterior (AP) knee laxity (prespecified noninferiority margin, +2-mm side-to-side difference) and superior muscle strength at 2 years after surgery when compared with patients who underwent ACLR with autograft. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: One hundred patients (median age, 17 years; median preoperative Marx activity score, 16) with complete midsubstance ACL injuries were enrolled and underwent surgery within 45 days of injury. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either BEAR (n = 65) or autograft ACLR (n = 35 [33 with quadrupled semitendinosus-gracilis and 2 with bone-patellar tendon-bone]). Outcomes-including the IKDC Subjective Score, the side-to-side difference in instrumented AP knee laxity, and muscle strength-were assessed at 2 years by an independent examiner blinded to the procedure. Patients were unblinded after their 2-year visit. RESULTS: In total, 96% of the patients returned for 2-year follow-up. Noninferiority criteria were met for both the IKDC Subjective Score (BEAR, 88.9 points; ACLR, 84.8 points; mean difference, 4.1 points [95% CI, -1.5 to 9.7]) and the side-to-side difference in AP knee laxity (BEAR, 1.61 mm; ACLR, 1.77 mm; mean difference, -0.15 mm [95% CI, -1.48 to 1.17]). The BEAR group had a significantly higher mean hamstring muscle strength index than the ACLR group at 2 years (98.2% vs 63.2%; P < .001). In addition, 14% of the BEAR group and 6% of the ACLR group had a reinjury that required a second ipsilateral ACL surgical procedure (P = .32). Furthermore, the 8 patients who converted from BEAR to ACLR in the study period and returned for the 2-year postoperative visit had similar primary outcomes to patients who had a single ipsilateral ACL procedure. CONCLUSION: BEAR resulted in noninferior patient-reported outcomes and AP knee laxity and superior hamstring muscle strength when compared with autograft ACLR at 2-year follow-up in a young and active cohort. These promising results suggest that longer-term studies of this technique are justified.

Titanium and poly-L-lactic acid with hydroxyapatite (PLLA-HA) screws have been compared, but with less than a decade of follow-up. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose was to compare long-term outcomes of hamstring autograft ACLR using either PLLA-HA screws or titanium screws. We hypothesized there would be no difference at 13 years in clinical scores or tunnel widening between PLLA-HA and titanium screw types, along with high-grade resorption and ossification of PLLA-HA screws. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Forty patients undergoing ACLR were randomized to receive either a PLLA-HA screw or a titanium screw for ACL hamstring autograft fixation. Blinded evaluation was performed at 2, 5, and 13 years using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm knee score, and KT-1000 arthrometer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 2 or 5 years and 13 years to evaluate tunnel volumes, ossification around the screw, graft integration, and cyst formation. Computed tomography (CT) of patients with PLLA-HA was performed at 13 years to evaluate tunnel volumes and intratunnel ossification. RESULTS: No differences were seen in clinical outcomes at 2, 5, or 13 years between the 2 groups. At 13 years, tibial tunnel volumes were smaller for the PLLA-HA group (2.17 cm3) compared with the titanium group (3.33 cm3; P = .004). By 13 years, the PLLA-HA group had complete or nearly complete resorption on MRI or CT scan. CONCLUSION: Equivalent clinical results were found between PLLA-HA and titanium groups at 2, 5, and 13 years. Although PLLA-HA screws had complete or nearly complete resorption by 13 years, tunnel volumes remained largely unchanged, with minimal ossification.","hydroxyapatite (1306-06-5, 51198-94-8), titanium (7440-32-6)",,,English,English,,32302205,L631572460,10.1177/0363546520911024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546520911024,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L631572460&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546520911024&atitle=Bioabsorbable+Versus+Titanium+Screws+in+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction+Using+Hamstring+Autograft%3A+A+Prospective%2C+Randomized+Controlled+Trial+With+13-Year+Follow-up&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=48&issue=6&spage=1316&epage=1326&aulast=Sundaraj&aufirst=Keran&auinit=K.&aufull=Sundaraj+K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1316-1326&date=2020&auinit1=K&auinitm=,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"

PURPOSE: To determine if modified iliotibial band tenodesis (MITBT) can improve clinical outcomes and reduce the recurrence of ACL ruptures when added to ACL reconstruction in patients with a residual pivot shift. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Patients with a primary ACL rupture satisfying the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: first ACL rupture, involved in pivoting sports, skeletally mature, no meniscal repair performed, and residual pivot shift relative to the contralateral uninjured knee immediately after ACL reconstruction. Patients were randomized to group A (no further surgery) or group B (MITBT added) and were followed up for 2 years. The patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures used were the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscale of sport/recreation (Sport/Rec), KOOS subscale of quality of life (QoL), Lysholm knee score (LKS), Tegner activity scale (TAS), recurrent ACL ruptures, or need for further surgery in either knee. Analysis of variance was used to compare PROs; the Wilcoxon test was used for the TAS; and the chi-square test was used for recurrence of ACL ruptures, meniscal injuries, and contralateral ACL ruptures (P < .05). RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were randomized: 27 to group A (female:male ratio = 15:12; mean age, 22.3 ± 3.7 years) and 28 to group B (female:male ratio = 17:11; mean age, 21.8 ± 4.1 years). At 2-year follow-up, group A had a similar IKDC score (90.9 ± 10.7 vs 94.2 ± 11.2; respectively; P = .21), lower KOOS Sport/Rec score (91.5 ± 6.4 vs 95.3 ± 4.4, respectively; P = .02), similar KOOS QoL score (92.0 ± 4.8 vs 95.1 ± 4.3, respectively; P = .14), lower LKS score (92.5 ± 4.8 vs 96.8 ± 8.0, respectively; P = .004), lower TAS score (median, 7 [range, 7-9] vs 8 [range, 8-10], respectively; P = .03), higher rate of recurrence (14.8% vs 0.0%, respectively; P < .001), similar rate of meniscal tears (14.8% vs 3.6%, respectively; P = .14), and similar rate of contralateral ACL ruptures (3.7% vs 3.6%, respectively; P = .99) relative to group B.

This will be directly measured with goniometric angle and heel-height measurements relative to the contralateral side. Other metrics will include standard, validated patient reported outcomes and requirements for additional interventions to treat extension deficits including, but not limited to, additional therapy, intraarticular injections, oral corticosteroids, manipulation under anesthesia, or arthroscopic arthrolysis.Detailed DescriptionThis study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing arthroscopic reconstruction of full thickness ACL tears with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. All patients who sign the consent form will be enrolled in the study and randomized to one of the two treatment arms. Subjects will be appropriately fitted for the brace corresponding to randomization on the day of surgery. All braces will be placed on the subject in the operating room at the conclusion of the procedure. All patient will begin a standardized physical therapy protocol on postoperative day 1-14. Follow-up will take place at standard of care office visits at 1-week, 2-week, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, and 6-months. Range of motion, including goniometric angle and heel-height measurements, will be recorded at all postoperative time points. Time-to-achievement of full symmetric extension relative to the non-surgical knee will be monitored and recorded. At 3, 6, and 12 months, patients will also be asked to complete standardized, patient-reported outcomes questionnaires including IKDC, KOOS, PROMIS, VAS pain, VR/SF 12, and brief resilience scale. Patients will also be asked to answer questions regarding return to work and return to sport throughout the 1-year postoperative period. Both treatment groups will progress according to standardized, postoperative rehabilitation programs, similar to the program outlined below. Phase I: Protection, Range of Motion (ROM), and Proprioception Goal: • To protect the surgical graft, restore lower extremity mobility, and proprioception Precautions: * Patient can initiate immediate weight bearing with knee immobilizer brace locked at 0º extension. * Patients may unlock or remove brace once they are able to perform a straight leg raise without any quadriceps lag and perform a single leg stance (SLS) on surgical limb for at least 30 seconds. Patients must also wear the brace with any weight bearing activity for six weeks. Criteria for progression to next phase: * Non-antalgic gait with no observable gait impairments * ROM: Goal of extension to at least 0º, and flexion within 10º of contralateral knee. * Perform single leg stance on surgical limb on dynamic surfaces (balance board, foam, etc.) Exercises to be included: ROM: * Flexion: heel slides, wall slides, prone hamstring curls * Extension: supine or prone hangs, hamstring and calf stretching NWB strengthening: • Quadriceps sets (prone and supine), leg raises, and bridges on a swiss ball Proprioception: • SLS from static to dynamic surfaces and movements, 3-way lunges, balance board, rebounder or therapist ball tossing Phase II: Strength and Endurance Goal: • Build single limb endurance and to prepare for agility training Precautions: • No running/jogging or jumping. Criteria for progression to next phase: * Full, pain free knee AROM within 3º of contralateral knee * Able to perform single leg squat to approximately 60º knee flexion for 2 minutes without joint pain or compensations * No compensatory gait patterns during faster ambulation speeds Exercises to be included: ROM: • Stretching as needed (calf, hamstring, quad, trunk, upper body) NWB: • Trunk/core dynamics Proprioception: • Single leg stance with trunk rotations (use resistance for progression), floor touches, cone pick-ups on stable and unstable surfaces Phase III: Power and Agility Goal: • Gain type II, fast twitch muscle fibers and prepare for return to sport training Precautions: * Not to be initiated until at least 12 weeks post-operatively * No uncontrolled jumping (i.e. on grass, when not supervised by medical staff) * No cutting or pivoting at full speeds Criteria for progression to next phase: * Perform single leg squat to approximately 60º knee flexion for 3 minutes against external resistance * Perform lateral and diagonal jumping of a distance equal to the patient's leg length or greater for 2 minutes or longer * Perform double leg jumps from at least. a 12-inch surface * Perform single leg static jumps from flat surface Exercises to be included: Leg press, lunge, hamstring curl Agility: • Ladder training, cone drills, lateral and diagonal jumping adding external resistance Phase IV: Return to Sport Training Precautions: * No physical contact during sport specific training * No live sport performance until cleared by functional sports assessment and surgeon Patients will undergo standard of care physical therapy 2-3 times per week for 20 weeks as directed by their physician.

Capio Artro Clinic (Stockholm) has vast experience in ACL surgery using both semitendinosus and quadriceps grafts.Detailed DescriptionThe purpose of the study is to evaluate the quadriceps graft with bone-plug in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACL-R) and compare it with the most common choice of graft, semitendinosus hamstrings graft in ACL-R in athletes with Tegner Activity Scale 7 or higher. Both methods are well-known and continually registered in the Swedish ACL Registry. Both grafts will be compared post operatively as to knee laxity (primary outcome), PROMs, as well as measure graft site morbidity, Return to Sports rate, and the post-operative rehab. At 9 months we will also preform a MRI scan to determine graft maturity. 5-year and 10-year data will also be acquired through the Swedish ACL-registry and Lysholm score and Tegner Activity Level score. At 10-year a plain weight baring X-ray will be preformed to evaluate development of osteoarthritis. The study design is a prospective randomized study with equal groups: Semitendinosus graft (=100) and Quadriceps tendon graft (n=100). According to historical material from Capio Artro Clinic (Stockholm) the following power calculation has been made: Significance lever 5 percent (p=0.05) and power is 80%. The difference between the groups is 1 mm knee laxity with KT-1000 which would give an effect size of 0,44 or less compared to an average effect size (0,50). 85 individuals will be needed in each group in the statistical analysis. Although no stratification for sex will be performed, our aim is to have a balanced representation of sex that reflects the typical patient population for this condition at the clinic, with a distribution of 40% females and 60% males across both groups. Inclusion will continue until we have at least 100 individuals in each group. This means that each group can have more than 100 individuals. Randomization process and study design will be done according to the CONSORT guidelines.

We compared subjective outcome (primary outcome) and knee stability, donor site morbidity and function (secondary outcomes). METHODS: From 2013 to 2015, we included 99 adults with isolated ACL injuries in the RCT. Fifty patients were randomised to QT grafts and 49 to STG grafts and followed for 2 years. Patient evaluated outcomes were performed by subjective International Knee Documentation Committee, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Kujala and Tegner activity scores. Knee laxity was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer. Donor site morbidity was evaluated by the 'donor site-related functional problems following ACLR score'. One-leg hop test tested limp strength symmetry. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, there was no difference between the two graft groups regarding subjective patient outcome, knee stability and reoperations. Also, at 2 years, donor site symptoms were present in 27% of patients in the QT group and 50% of patients in the STG group. The donor site morbidity score was 14 and 22 for the QT and STG, respectively. Hop test demonstrated lower limp symmetry for QT graft than STG graft of 91% and 97% respectively. CONCLUSION: QT graft for ACLR did not result in inferior subjective outcome compared with STG graft. However, QT graft was associated with lower donor site morbidity than STG grafts but resulted in more quadriceps muscle strength deficiency than hamstring grafts. Both graft types had similar knee stability outcome.

Methods: Between August 2016 and December 2016, forty patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendon were randomly divided into isokinetic group and control group ( n=20). The two groups of patients underwent staged rehabilitation treatment. The isokinetic group replaced the traditional intervention with the corresponding isokinetic strength training from 3 to 6 months after operation, and the traditional rehabilitation intervention was used in the control group. Finally, 12 cases of isokinetic group and 12 cases of control group with complete follow-up were enrolled in study. There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass index, side of injury, the interval between injury and operation, and preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score between the two groups ( P>0.05).

The MRI examination was performed at the same time to evaluate graft remodeling. The shape, tension, and degree of vascularization of grafts were observed under arthroscopy. The grafts were harvested and observed by HE staining. Results: The invertal between ACL reconstruction and the second-look arthroscopy was (23.57±3.23) months in isokinetic group and (23.22±3.56) months in control group, showing no significant difference between the two groups ( P>0.05). At the second-look arthroscopy, the IKDC score was 90.45±4.73 in isokinetic group and 89.32±4.54 in control group, showing significant differences when compared with preoperative scores in the two groups ( P<0.05). But there was no significant difference between the two groups ( t=0.868， P=0.404).

Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a novel thermoplastic polymer with high biocompatibility and mechanical properties that mimic native bone, and it can be imaged on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without signal flare. PURPOSE: To compare the clinical performance of ACL reconstruction with PEEK and titanium interference screws at 2 years and to evaluate a novel method of measuring tunnel volume. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A total of 133 patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with 4-strand hamstring autografts and were randomized to have titanium or PEEK interference screws for femoral and tibial tunnel fixation. At 2 years, subjective Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores were assessed and clinical examination performed. At 12 months, MRI was performed to assess graft incorporation and cyst formation, and a novel technique was employed to measure tunnel volumes. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in graft rerupture rate, contralateral ACL rupture rate, subjective outcomes, or objective outcomes. In the titanium and PEEK groups, MRI demonstrated high overall rates of graft integration (96%-100% and 90%-93%, respectively) and ligamentization (89% and 84%) and low rates of synovitis (22% and 10%) and cyst formation (0%-18% and 13%-15%). There was a higher proportion of patients with incomplete graft integration within the femoral tunnel in the PEEK group as compared with the titanium group (10% vs 0%, P = .03); however, the authors suggest that metal artifact precluded proper assessment of the graft in the titanium group by MRI. Tunnel volumes also appeared to be equivalent in the 2 groups and were measured with a novel technique that was highly reproducible in the PEEK group secondary to the absence of flare. CONCLUSION: Two-year clinical analysis of PEEK interference screws for femoral and tibial fixation of ACL reconstructions showed equivalent clinical performance to titanium interference screws. Given the excellent mechanical characteristics, biological compatibility, and absence of metal artifact on MRI, PEEK has become our material of choice for interference screw fixation in ACL reconstruction.",,,,English,English,,31306589,L628749826,10.1177/0363546519861530,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546519861530,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L628749826&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546519861530&atitle=A+Randomized+Controlled+Trial+of+PEEK+Versus+Titanium+Interference+Screws+for+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction+With+2-Year+Follow-up&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=47&issue=10&spage=2386&epage=2393&aulast=Shumborski&aufirst=Sarah&auinit=S.&aufull=Shumborski+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2386-2393&date=2019&auinit1=S&auinitm=,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"

ACL-QOL scores increased significantly from baseline for all groups (p < 0.0001), but mean scores at 5 years did not differ among the groups (p = 0.548): mean (and standard deviation) of 82.5 ± 17.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.0 to 86.0) for patellar tendon, 83.9 ± 18.2 (95% CI, 80.3 to 87.4) for hamstring tendon, and 81.1 ± 19.3 (95% CI, 77.4 to 84.8) for double-bundle. The proportions of patients at 5 years with a pivot shift grade of ≥2 (12% for patellar tendon, 16% for hamstring tendon, and 22% for double-bundle; p = 0.149) and with normal and nearly normal knees per IKDC grade (87%, 82%, and 75% for the 3 groups, respectively; p = 0.093) trended in favor of patellar tendon reconstruction. No differences were seen for the IKDC subjective scores, knee range of motion including passive extension deficits, the single leg hop test, Cincinnati Occupational Rating scores, and Tegner activity levels. Kneeling pain was more common with patellar tendon reconstruction (10% of patients compared with 4% for hamstring tendon and 2% for double-bundle; p = 0.029). For hamstring tendon and double-bundle reconstructions, there were trends toward more complete traumatic reruptures (4% for patellar tendon, 10% for hamstring tendon, and 10% for double-bundle; p = 0.145) and partial traumatic tears (0%, 5%, and 6%, respectively; p = 0.059), with significantly fewer combined traumatic reinjuries in the patellar tendon group (4 patients compared with 16 for hamstring tendon and 17 for double-bundle; p = 0.010). Atraumatic graft failure (pivot shift grade of ≥2) was found for 10% of the patients.Conclusions:At 5 years, we found no significant difference in the quality-of-life outcome among the patellar tendon, hamstring tendon, and double-bundle techniques for ACL reconstruction. Significantly more patients in the hamstring tendon and double-bundle groups experienced traumatic graft reinjury compared with the patellar tendon group. There was a trend toward a higher percentage with normal and nearly normal IKDC grades in the patellar tendon group compared with hamstring tendon and double-bundle groups.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level I.

Persistent rotational laxity following ACLR has been correlated with poor outcome and graft failure. We hypothesize that anterolateral complex reconstruction by way of a Modified Lemaire Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis (LET) in combination with single bundle ACLR would reduce the risk of persistent rotatory laxity in young individuals who are deemed as being at high risk of failure. We will conduct a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing standard single bundle hamstring ACLR with combined ACLR and LET. Methods: Six-hundred patients (300 per group) aged 25 years or less with an ACL deficient knee that meet two of the following three criteria will be included: 1) Grade 2 pivot shift or greater; 2) Returning to high risk cutting or pivoting sports; 3) Generalized ligamentous laxity. Participants will be seen at 3-months, 6-months, 12-months and 24-months post-operatively. The primary outcome measure is graft failure requiring revision ACLR or symptomatic instability associated with a positive asymmetric pivot shift indicating persistent rotational laxity. Patients will complete secondary outcome measures at each follow-up visit including patient-reported outcome measures, functional and biomechanical testing, and magnetic resonance imaging. Discussion: This protocol is the first adequately powered randomized clinical trial investigating the effects of augmenting ACLR with an LET in patients at high-risk of graft failure. The successful completion of this trial has the potential to change surgical practice and provide evidence for the role of the LET in ACLR.

The best choice of graft for reconstruction remains undecided. This prospective, randomized clinical trial aimed to compare clinical results of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts and four-strand semitendinosus-gracilis (QHT) grafts for ACL reconstruction over a 1-year follow-up interval in Indian population. Methods: 42 consecutive patients with ACL injury were recruited, by pick and draw method and allotted into two groups with 21 patients in each group. Group A patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using BPTB graft while QHT autograft was used for patients in Group B. All the patients underwent standard ipsilateral arthroscopic ACL reconstruction procedure using a single incision, antero-medial (AM) portal technique for BPTB or the QHT autograft by a same surgeon. Patients were followed up regularly for a minimum period of 1 year. Results: After one year, the Cincinnati score was 91 ± 4.117 in BPTB group and 89.29 ± 5.371 in QHT group (P = 0.282). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the mean scores with respect to pain, overall activity level and running in the Cincinnati score. None of the patients complained of the knee giving way. Similarly, at 1 year, the Lysholm score was 92.84 ± 2.630 and 90.55 ± 2.395 in the two groups respectively (P = 0.842). There were no episodes of locking or instability and there was no significant difference in the mean Lysholm scores regarding pain and squatting. Conclusion: There was no significant functional difference between the two grafts in terms of Lysholm and the Cincinnati score, anterior knee laxity and altered sensation over proximal leg.

The 2018 International Olympic Committee (IOC) Consensus Statement now outlines the quadriceps tendon as a possible autograft option. However, no Randomised Control Trial (RCT) has examined the efficacy of the quadriceps tendon autograft in primary paediatric ACL reconstruction compared to the historical ""gold-standard"" soft-tissue hamstring autograft in this population. In light of its evidence for favourable outcomes in the adult population, and the (albeit limited) evidence showing safety and promise in the paediatric population, clinical equipoise exists for assessing its impact on outcomes in paediatric patients at the index surgery. This is a parallel, international, multi-centre, blinded randomized controlled trial of 352 skeletally-immature (at the time of injury) patients (ages 10-18 years, inclusive) undergoing primary ACL reconstruction to compare the effect of autograft tendon choice (i.e. hamstring versus soft-tissue quadriceps) on the rates of ACL graft failure, return-to-sport, knee function, pain, health-related quality of life and health utility, psychological factors, range of motion and stability, and any other adverse events at 24 months.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT03896464,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03896464,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03896464&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Although several clinical studies have yielded good short-term results, high-quality evidence is lacking in regard to the effectiveness of this treatment compared with ACL reconstruction. HYPOTHESIS: Dynamic augmented ACL suture repair is at least as effective as anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction for the treatment of acute ACL rupture in terms of patient self-reported outcomes at 2 years postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: After stratification and randomization, 48 patients underwent either dynamic augmented ACL suture repair or ACL reconstruction with a single-bundle, all-inside, semitendinosus technique. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score at 2 years postoperatively was the primary outcome measure. Patient-reported outcomes (IKDC subjective score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Tegner score, visual analog scale for satisfaction), clinical outcomes (IKDC physical examination score, leg symmetry index for the quadriceps, hamstrings strength, and jump test battery), and radiological outcomes as well as adverse events including reruptures were recorded. Analyses were based on an intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The lower limit for the median IKDC subjective score of the repair group (86.2) fell within the prespecified noninferiority margin, confirming noninferiority of dynamic augmented ACL suture repair compared with ACL reconstruction. No statistical difference was found between groups for median IKDC subjective score (repair, 95.4; reconstruction, 94.3). Overall, 2 reruptures (8.7%) occurred in the dynamic ACL suture repair group and 4 reruptures (19.0%) in the ACL reconstruction group; further, 5 repeat surgeries-other than for revision ACL surgery-took place in 4 patients from the dynamic ACL suture repair group (20.8%) and in 3 patients from the ACL reconstruction group (14.3%). CONCLUSION: Dynamic augmented ACL suture repair is not inferior to ACL reconstruction in terms of subjective patient-reported outcomes as measured with the IKDC subjective score 2 years postoperatively. However, for reasons other than revision ACL surgery due to rerupture, a higher number of related adverse events leading to repeat surgery were seen in the dynamic augmented ACL suture repair group within 2 years postoperatively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dynamic augmented ACL suture repair might be a viable treatment option for patients with an acute ACL rupture.

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to report the 12- and 24-month outcomes of patients who underwent the BEAR procedure compared with a nonrandomized concurrent control group who underwent ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with an autograft. We hypothesized that the BEAR group would have physical examination findings, patient-reported outcomes, and adverse events that were similar to those of the ACLR group. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Ten patients underwent BEAR, and 10 underwent ACLR with a 4-stranded hamstring autograft. At 24 months, 9 of the 10 BEAR patients and 7 of the 10 ACLR patients completed a study visit. Outcomes reported included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective results, knee anteroposterior (AP) laxity findings via an arthrometer, and functional outcomes. Results: There were no graft or repair failures in the first 24 months after surgery. The IKDC subjective scores in both groups improved significantly from baseline (P <.0001) at 12 and 24 months, to 84.6 ± 17.2 in the ACLR group and to 91.7 ± 11.7 in the BEAR group.

Functional hop testing results were similar in the 2 groups at 12 and 24 months after surgery. Hamstring strength indices were significantly higher in the BEAR group compared with the ACLR group (P =.0001).

Saunders,"Purpose: To determine preoperative predictors of long-term acceptable knee function and the development of osteoarthritis (OA) in long-term follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: This study is a long-term follow-up of 2 previous randomized controlled trials that included 193 patients who underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral hamstring tendon or patellar tendon autografts. Patients who suffered multiligament injuries, major meniscal injuries, chondral lesions requiring surgical treatment, or had a previous ACL reconstruction were excluded. Patient demographics, preoperative clinical assessments, and intraoperative findings were used to create stepwise multivariable regression models to determine the patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) in the International Knee Documentation Committee and the development of OA defined as a Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥2. Knee laxity measurements, hop performance, patient-reported outcome, and concomitant injuries were determined as variables. Results: A total of 147 patients (63.7% men) were eligible for inclusion, with a mean follow-up of 16.4 ± 1.3 years. The patients were an average age of 27.9 ± 8.3 years at the time of ACL reconstruction. One-half of the cohort reported an International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation system score above the PASS cutoff. The presence of a concomitant injury at operation (odds ratio [OR], 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-6.21; P =.030) and greater preoperative anteroposterior laxity (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.05-3.35; P =.034) increased the likelihood of achieving a PASS. A longer period between ACL injury and reconstruction (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.02-5.00; P =.046) and older age at reconstruction (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.34-3.86; P =.0023) increased the odds of developing OA at follow-up. Conclusions: Patients who were older at the time of ACL reconstruction and had waited >1 year between the injury and reconstruction ran an increased risk of having OA 16 years after reconstruction. One in 2 patients reported acceptable long-term knee function, but no risk factor for poorer subjective knee function was identified. Patients who had a minor concomitant injury and increased preoperative anteroposterior knee laxity had increased odds of reporting an acceptable long-term knee function.

Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of a new oral nutritional supplement (Progen) that contains hydrolyzed collagen peptides and plasma proteins, a hyaluronic acid–chondroitin sulfate complex, and vitamin C. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: The study included patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstring autografts using the same fixation method. All patients received the same analgesia and physical therapy (PT) protocol and were randomized to receive either the nutritional supplement (supplemented group) or no additional therapy (control group). Patients were followed up at days 7, 30, 60, and 90. Pain was assessed by use of a visual analog scale (VAS) and by analgesic consumption. Clinical outcome was assessed via International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and the number of PT sessions. Perceived efficacy and tolerability were rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Graft maturation was assessed by a blinded musculoskeletal radiologist using magnetic resonance imaging. The number of adverse events (AEs) was recorded. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis included 72 patients, 36 allocated to the supplemented group and 36 to the control group, with no significant differences regarding demographic and preoperative characteristics. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain and function (measured by VAS and IKDC scores) during the 90-day follow-up period (P <.001 for both), without significant differences between groups. The supplemented group had fewer patients that needed analgesics (8.5% vs 50.0%; P <.05) and attended fewer PT sessions (38.0 vs 48.4 sessions; P <.001) at 90 days and had a higher IKDC score at 60 days (62.5 vs 55.5; P =.029) compared with the control group. Patient- and physician-perceived efficacy was considered significantly higher in the supplemented group at 60 and 90 days (P <.05). Perceived tolerability of the overall intervention was better in the supplemented group at 30, 60, and 90 days (P <.05). Graft maturation showed more advanced degrees (grades 3 and 4) in the supplemented group at 90 days (61.8% vs 38.2%; P <.01). No intolerance or AEs associated with the nutritional supplement treatment were reported. Conclusion: The combination of the nutritional supplement and PT after ACL reconstruction improved pain, clinical outcome, and graft maturation. Nutritional supplementation showed higher efficacy during the second month of recovery, without causing AEs.

METHODS: Forty-eight patients (age: 29.5 ± 6.8 years, body mass index: 26.1 ± 3.2 kg/m2) who had undergone ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into three groups when they reached four weeks post surgery: (1) concentric CE (n = 16); (2) eccentric CE (n = 16); and (3) control (n = 16). All groups followed the same post-surgical rehabilitation program for their reconstructed limb. Additionally, the two experimental groups followed eight weeks of isokinetic training for the uninjured knee at 60°/s for 3 days per week. Quadriceps maximum voluntary isometric strength (MVIC) was measured during the 4th week (pre-training), 12th week (post training), and 24th week post surgery. The single-leg hop distance and International Knee Documentary Committee (IKDC) scores were also evaluated during the 24th week post surgery. Analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Group-by-time interaction was significant for quadriceps MVICs for reconstructed and healthy limbs (p = 0.02). Quadriceps strength of both knees was greater in concentric and eccentric CE groups compared to control group during the 12th- and 24th weeks post surgery (p < 0.05). Strength gain was 28% and 31% in concentric and eccentric CE groups, respectively, when compared with the control group. Concentric and eccentric CE had similar effects on quadriceps strength recovery (n.s.). IKDC score, and single-leg hop distances were not significantly different among groups (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: Concentric and eccentric quadricep strengthening of healthy limbs in early phases of ACL rehabilitation improved post-surgical quadriceps strength recovery of the reconstructed limb. CE should be integrated into ACL reconstruction rehabilitation, especially in the early rehabilitative phases to restore quadriceps strength.

Methods: A prospective clinical study was performed to compare 30 cases of single-tunnel ACL double-bundle anatomic reconstruction to 28 cases of double-tunnel ACL double-bundle anatomic reconstruction, with average follow-up of 36 months. All graft tendons were hamstring tendon autografts. Tunnel placements in all the cases were made anatomically. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction. Graft appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analyzed. Results: Tunnel placements were in the anatomic positions in both groups. On the lateral pivot-shift test performed at 36 months postoperatively, there was no significant difference between groups. Clinical results such as International Knee Documentation Committee score, Tegner activity scale, and range of motion showed no significant differences between the groups. The mean thickness of anteromedial graft was reduced by 10.3% and that of the posterolateral graft was reduced by 11.1% from the original graft thickness evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. No new meniscal tears were found either group; however, cartilage damage occurred in the double-tunnel group at 39.3%, and this rate was significantly higher than that in the single-tunnel group (10.0%).

Methods: A total of 56 participants were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and placed into two groups: HT or QT. The hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio was the primary end-point measured with a Genu-3 dynamometer. Peak torque, functional assessment (Lysholm knee scoring scale and Cincinnati Knee Rating System), and anteroposterior laxity (KT-2000™ arthrometer) were also assessed.

Results: The results of the H/Q ratio analysis of the participants over time revealed significant differences at 60, 180, and 300°/s at three, six, and 12 months of follow-up (60°/s: F = 5.3, p = 0.005; 180°/s: F = 5.5, p = 0.004; 300°/s: F = 5.1, p = 0.005).

There were no significant differences in functional endpoints or arthrometer assessments at 24 months of follow-up. Conclusion: An ACLR with a QT graft showed similar functional results with a better isokinetic H/Q ratio compared to an ACLR with the HT at 12 months of follow-up in soccer players.

Methods: A prospective randomized controlled study was performed in 116 patients who underwent ACLR with autologous hamstring tendons augmented with cartilage fragments (study group, n = 56) or without any augmentation (control group, n = 60). All patients were followed up for 25.6 months (range, 24-28 months), and the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and visual analog scale score were determined. Computed tomography scans of all patients were obtained 2 years after surgery to evaluate the diameter of the femoral tunnel and thereby assess the amount of tunnel widening. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation was performed 2 years postoperatively to evaluate the status of the graft in the femoral tunnel. In addition, 5 patients underwent biopsy of the tendon-bone interface at 24 months postoperatively with histologic assessment and transmission electron microscopy. Results: A total of 107 patients completed the follow-up. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of International Knee Documentation Committee score (P =.07), Lysholm score (P =.10), and visual analog scale score (P =.57) at 24 months' follow-up. The femoral tunnel diameter and the tunnel widening percentage in the study group were significantly smaller than those in the control group (P <.001). The signal-noise quotient value of the graft in the femoral tunnel was 10.4 ± 7.0 in the study group, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (19.5 ± 9.2, P <.001). Histologic studies of the tendon-bone interface showed that there were more bone formations containing chondroid cells with aligned connective tissue in the study group compared with the control group; in addition, the diameter of the collagen fibrils in the study group was considerably thicker than that in the control group (P <.05).

Systematic reviews highlight the lack of long-term results between the two grafts. HYPOTHESIS: Seventeen years after ACL reconstruction, no difference will be found in functional outcome, quality of life, and graft failure between patients with patellar tendon (PT) or semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (STG) autografts; however, a significant difference will be seen in the prevalence of osteoarthritis. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Sixty-four patients were included in this prospective study (32 in each group). A single surgeon performed primary ACL reconstruction in alternating sequence. Forty-eight patients (24 in each group) were evaluated 17 years after ACL reconstruction: A clinical assessment was made based on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, instrumented laxity was measured with KT-1000 arthrometer, and radiography of the operated knee was conducted and assessed for degenerative disease. The Lysholm questionnaire and the Short Form-36 version 2 questionnaire were filled out by the patients. RESULTS: At the 17-year follow-up, no statistically significant differences were seen with respect to graft failure (2 reruptures in the semitendinosus and gracilis tendon [STG] group [6.3%] and 3 reruptures in the PT group [9.4%]) and functional outcome. Increased instrumented laxity (>3 mm) measured with KT-1000 arthrometer was seen in significantly more patients in the STG group (8 in the STG group compared with 2 in the PT group; P = .03) with a mean side-to-side difference of 2.17 ± 1.86 mm in the STG group compared with 1.33 ± 1.93 mm in the PT group. A significant difference was found in frequency of knee osteoarthritis (OA)-100% in the PT group compared with 71% in the STG group ( P = .004). Patients in the PT group tended to have higher grade OA according to the IKDC grading system, with an average grade of 1.46 in the PT group compared with 1 in the STG group ( P = .055). The degenerative changes in the PT group were more common in the medial and patellofemoral compartments ( P = .003 and P = .04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Both autografts provided good to excellent subjective outcomes. No significant differences were noted in graft failure and clinical instability. However, significantly more patients in the STG group had increased instrumented anteroposterior translation measured with KT-1000 arthrometer, and there was a greater prevalence of knee OA at 17 years after surgery in the PT group.",,,,English,English,,29741911,L629131661,10.1177/0363546518768768,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546518768768,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L629131661&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546518768768&atitle=Long-term+Comparison+of+Semitendinosus+and+Gracilis+Tendon+Versus+Patellar+Tendon+Autografts+for+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction%3A+A+17-Year+Follow-up+of+a+Randomized+Controlled+Trial&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=46&issue=8&spage=1800&epage=1808&aulast=Sajovic&aufirst=Matjaz&auinit=M.&aufull=Sajovic+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1800-1808&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"
Intraarticular Injection of Tranexamic Acid Reduced Postoperative Hemarthrosis in Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction - A Prospective Randomized Study,,,,,,5/15/2025,5/15/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2018). Date of Publication: 26 Jun 2018,clinicaltrials.gov,2018,,,,,26-Jun-18,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryPost-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) hemarthrosis may result in increased pain thus delaying postoperative rehabilitation, which may eventually lead to arthrofibrosis and a functional deficit. Many antifibrinolytic agents, including tranexamic acid (TXA), have been used in orthopedic surgeries to reduce postoperative bleeding.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of intra-articular injection of TXA in patients receiving arthroscopic ACLRs. Patients were randomized into two groups. Group 1 patients (TXA group) received the index procedures with a 10 mL intra-articular injection of TXA. Group 2 (control group) patients received the index procedures without TXA injections. An intra-articular suction drain was placed recorded 24 h postoperatively. Clinical evaluations using an IKDC functional score, range of motion (ROM), and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score were performed at postoperative day 3 and week 4.Detailed DescriptionTXA group patients received ACLRs and a 10 mL intra-articular injection of TXA after the procedure. The control group patients only received ACLRs without TXA injections. Randomization was done on the day of the surgery, by an independent investigator who did not participate in the surgery, using the permuted block randomization technique. The same surgeon treated all patients enrolled in this study. Spinal anesthesia was given to all patients and a pneumatic tourniquet was routinely used. In brief, through a 3 cm incision over the medial proximal tibia, semitendinosus (ST) and gracilis (Gr) tendons were harvested from the distal insertion. Tendons were quadrupled and whip stitched by No. 2 and No. 5 Ethibond sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). The diameters of the folded tendons were determined by using sizing cylinders with incremental size changes of 0.5 mm.The femoral sockets were created at about the 1:30 position (left knee), through the anteromedial portal. The tibial tunnel was created with an ACUFEX guide (Smith \& Nephew, Andover, MA). The diameters of the socket were created in the same manner as the diameter of the folded graft. At tibial site, grafts were fixed with bioscrews (BIORCI-HA, Smith \& Nephew) at 30 degrees of knee flexion. The screw and the tunnel sizes were the same. After completion of the procedure, a suction drain (Zimmer HEMOVAC, Warsaw, IN) was placed at the superior lateral aspect of the joint. Ten mL of TXA (100 mg/mL) (Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the joint at the end of the operation and the drain was clamped for 2 h. Clinical evaluations The volume of drainage was recorded 24 h after surgery. The grade of hemarthrosis, as previously described by Coupens et al.,was also documented at day 3 and week The range of knee motion and the IKDC functional score were evaluated 4 weeks post-surgery. The VAS was documented at postoperative day 3 and week 4. Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as a mean and standard deviation (SD). The amount of drainage or functional scores between different groups were compared with an independent t test. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,IL).

Although it provides satisfactory results, not all patients return to their previous activity level and moreover, early posttraumatic osteoarthritis is not prevented. As such, a renewed interest has emerged in ACL suture repair combined with dynamic augmentation. Compared to ACL reconstruction, the hypothesized advantages of ACL suture repair are earlier return to sports, reduction of early posttraumatic osteoarthritis and preservation of the patient's native ACL tissue and proprioceptive envelope of the knee. In recent literature, ACL suture repair combined with dynamic augmentation tends to be at least equally effective compared to ACL reconstruction, but no randomized comparative study has yet been conducted. Methods/design: This study is a prospective, stratified, block randomized controlled trial. Forty-eight patients with an ACL rupture will be assigned to either a suture repair group with dynamic augmentation and microfracture of the femoral notch, or an ACL reconstruction group with autologous semitendinosis graft and all-inside technique. The primary objective is to investigate the hypothesis that suture repair of a ruptured ACL results in at least equal effectiveness compared with an ACL reconstruction in terms of patient self-reported outcomes (IKDC 2000 subjective scale) 1 year postoperatively. Secondary objectives are to evaluate patient self-reported outcomes (IKDC 2000, KOOS, Tegner, VAS), re-rupture rate, rehabilitation time required for return to daily and sports activities, achieved levels of sports activity, clinimetrics (Rolimeter, LSI, Isoforce) and development of osteoarthritis, at short term (6 weeks, 3, 6 and 9 months and 1 year), midterm (2 and 5 years) and long term (10 years) postoperatively. Discussion: A renewed interest has emerged in ACL suture repair combined with dynamic augmentation in the treatment of ACL rupture. Recent cohort studies show good short- and midterm results for this technique. This randomized controlled trial has been designed to compare the outcome of suture repair of a ruptured ACL, combined with DIS as well as microfracture of the femoral notch, with ACL reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus.

However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the optimal time of surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to compare the range of motion and functional outcome in patients who underwent ACLR early with those that were delayed.

Retaining the insertion may help to preserve vascularity and viability of the graft and bypass the stages of avascular necrosis and revascularization, which might be beneficial to graft maturity. PURPOSE: To investigate and compare graft maturity by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after ACL reconstruction with preservation or detachment of hamstring tendon tibial insertion at up to 2 years. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Forty-five patients (age range, 18-45 years) undergoing isolated ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon were enrolled and randomized to 2 groups. The tibial insertion of the hamstring tendon was preserved in the study group (n = 21) and detached in the control group (n = 24). Patients had follow-up at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, which consisted of the following: (1) clinical examination and (2) MRI evaluation of graft signal intensity based on signal/noise quotient (SNQ) values. Finally, 18 patients in the study group and 19 in the control group received full follow-up evaluation (ie, at all 4 time points). RESULTS: All knees acquired full range of motion at 24 months without significant laxity. At each time point, the KT-1000 arthrometer revealed no significant difference between groups; the clinical scores significantly improved in both groups, although the difference between groups was not significant. In the control group, the SNQ value increased from 3 months, peaked at 6 months, and then decreased (3 months, 21.4 ± 12.7; 6 months, 25.6 ± 12; 12 months, 18.3 ± 7.7; 24 months, 15.3 ± 6.3). However, the insertion-preserved graft in the study group maintained relatively lower and unchanged signal intensity throughout all time points (3 months, 15.0 ± 11.2; 6 months, 14.9 ± 6.3; 12 months, 12.6 ± 7.0; 24 months, 14.6 ± 7.0). Between groups, there was no significant difference at 3 or 24 months ( P = .11 and .75, respectively), while the SNQ values were significantly lower in the study group versus the control group at 6 and 12 months ( P = .002 and .02, respectively).

Date of Publication: 13 Feb 2018,clinicaltrials.gov,2018,,,,,13-Feb-18,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummarySingle-blind, multi-centre, prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing Ligamys Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) repair, Internal Bracing ACL repair and conventional ACL reconstruction for relative clinical efficacy and economic benefit. Patients with a primary proximal acute ACL rupture will be included in either study 1 (0-4 weeks post rupture) or study 2 (5-12 weeks post rupture) of the LIBRE study.Detailed DescriptionRationale The conventional operative treatment of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is an ACL reconstruction, whereby the residual ruptured ACL is removed and replaced by an autograft hamstring tendon. Recently, two alternative natural healing techniques have been developed and proof of concept have been established. The two repair techniques are: Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilization (DIS) and Internal Brace Ligament Augmentation (IBLA). Both DIS and IBLA allow the rupture to heal by itself. The biggest difference between the two techniques is that the DIS system consists of a polyethylene suture and a spring screw system, which stabilizes the knee joint with the same force during flexion and extension of the knee, and the IBLA system consists of a 2mm high molecular weight polyethylene FiberTape®. Objective The aim is to identify the optimal ACL technique for treating an acute ACL injury that can deliver an enhanced clinical efficacy and economic benefit for two time frames (0-4 weeks and 5-12 weeks) following ACL rupture. Study design Two separate, interventional, single-blind, comparative, multi-centre, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be conducted. The University Hospital of Antwerp (UHA), University Hospital of Brussels (UHB) and OLV Hospital (OLVH) are the three participating sites. A total of 96 patients will be included in the study, 48 for study 1 and 48 for study 2. The anticipated study duration is 72 months which will include a five month starting-up phase, 40 month recruitment period, a 24 month follow-up period and three months for final analysis. The study data will be collected over three periods: pre-operative, per-operative and post-operative. To meet the aim the time-dependent nature of ACL repair surgery has to be taken into account. As the DIS should be performed within a short period after the ACL rupture, study 1 is limited to 4 weeks after ACL rupture. IBLA can be performed up to 12 weeks after ACL rupture, therefore the time limit for study 2 is 12 weeks after ACL rupture. ACL reconstruction is preferably performed when the knee has 'cooled down', and this is from 5 weeks post-rupture. There is no time limit for the ACL reconstruction, since this can be performed up to several years post-rupture. • Study 1: RCT 1 DIS versus IBLA within 4 weeks after the ACL rupture. • Study 2: RCT 2 IBLA versus the conventional ACL reconstruction between 5-12 weeks after the ACL rupture. Study population Patients with a primary acute proximal ACL rupture, below the age of 50 years. The ACL remnant must be suitable for repair. Intervention The conventional ACL reconstruction, DIS or IBLA surgery. Main study objectives Primary outcome: Difference of 13 points in IKDC score between the reconstruction technique and the repair techniques (DIS/IBLA) 6 months postoperatively. Main secondary outcomes: Failure/re-rupture, Tegner score, Lysholm score, EQ-5D-5L, return to work/sport, Lachman test, Pivot Shift test and complications. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, and benefit Proof of concept have been established and the expected complications are similar in the three treatment arms. The major benefit of the alternative repair techniques is the preservation of the native ACL and its own proprioceptors possibly leading to a faster recovery time.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT03441295,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03441295,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03441295&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Arthroscopic Primary Repair of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL),,,,,,5/29/2025,5/29/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2018). Date of Publication: 2 Feb 2018,clinicaltrials.gov,2018,,,,,2-Feb-18,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryA prospective cohort study that will be conducted at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital. It aims to determine the outcomes, in terms of, activity level, functional level, subjective knee function, range of motion, stability, and failure, among patients with acute ACL injuries, who undergo arthroscopic primary ACL repair; and to compare these results with patients who undergo arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. To the investigators' knowledge, there is a dearth of studies looking into the outcomes of arthroscopic primary ACL repair and this going to be the first study in the Middle East. The investigators believe that arthroscopic primary ACL repair is superior to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction; and conducting this research project will elucidate the previously abandoned facts about acute ACL repair; and will eventually have a huge impact in the field of orthopedic surgery.Detailed DescriptionHypothesis Null hypothesis: no difference in outcomes between arthroscopic primary ACL repair and arthroscopic ACL reconstruction in patients with acute ACL tear. Alternative hypothesis: the arthroscopic primary ACL repair is superior to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important mechanical stabilizer during knee-joint movement; it is the primary restraint against anterior tibial translation relative to the femur; and it acts as secondary restraint to tibial rotation and varus/valgus rotation. ACL injuries are commonly seen among athletics; and the number is increasing, with a reported incidence of 38/100,000 per year. Although there is still some debate about the optimal treatment for acute ACL tears, surgical management in the young and active patient is recommended. The surgical management options to an isolated ACL tear vary from acute repair to ligament reconstruction. Acute ACL repair can be classified into: acute primary repair, acute repair with the use of a ligament augmentation device, and acute repair with augmentation with an autologous hamstring tendon graft. The outcome of acute repair of ACL rupture from its femoral attachment or a proximal tear close to it, is the aim to be accomplished at the end of this project. Several studies demonstrated that the results of acute repair of ACL ruptures deteriorate with time and the procedure was shown to be ineffective. However, most of the published studies are retrospective and nonrandomized, and they compare different surgical techniques, rehabilitation, and follow-up protocols. The surgeries were open and lengthy, the repairs were done on all injury types, on wide variety of ages, with varied concomitant injuries, and the rehab was primeval. Furthermore, there is no study that has described the long-term results of acute ACL repair. Although the concept of ACL potential healing has been deserted in the past, there is renewed interest in the primary healing capacity of this ligament. One would argue why there is a need for the repair of a torn ACL. First, the operation is simple and takes less time and less risk in comparison to ACL reconstruction. Second, ACL treatment aims to provide immediate knee stability; resolve the pain and avoiding long-term complications, primarily osteoarthritis. ACL reconstruction using an autologous or allogenic tendon graft, is universally accepted as the gold standard treatment for complete ACL tears, as it yields excellent results for instability and pain in most the patients. However, there is a higher failure rate in adolescents than in other age groups with up to 20% to 25% of patients experiencing problems postoperatively. This mandates to find a better solution for this group of patients. In addition, patients post ACL reconstructions were found to have higher rates of osteoarthritis, despite the treatment; these findings are based on long-term follow up studies. This emphasizes on the need to find an alternative surgical management option to improve the ultimate outcomes. Third, the incidence of ACL injuries in skeletally immature patients are increasing; and so far, there are no standardized treatment options. For this group of patients, the transphyseal ACL reconstruction with grafts carries a risk for limb length and angular deformities, although several studies have proven no increase in the rate of such complications. Hence, the pre-pubescent population has the potential to benefit greatly from this regenerative treatment, which does not violate the physes; and they respond remarkably to certain biological stimuli implemented in the current enhanced repair techniques. Fourth, regeneration of the ACL over reconstruction preserves the remaining proprioceptive fibers within the ligament substance, and maintains the complex insertion sites of the ligament. This could potentially lead to more normal biomechanics of the knee if adequate regeneration is achieved. Material and methods This is a prospective cohort study that will be conducted at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH) and it involves patients with acute ACL injury attending the orthopedic clinic. The ACL rupture will be assessed clinically by anterior drawer test (ADT), Lachman's test, and pivot shift test. The ACL tear will be confirmed by knee MRI. The ethical approval and permission from the concerned institution is required to start the study. All eligible patients who consent to participate will be included in the study. The arthroscopic ACL repair will be carried out by one expert orthopedic surgeon. Because arthroscopy is a reference standard for the diagnosis of internal derangements of the knee, and because it is unethical to sacrifice a torn ACL that can be repaired; the patients will be assessed intra-operatively, and will be divided into two groups (group 1= ACL repair); group 2= ACL reconstruction) based on ACL amenability for repair or reconstruction. If the ACL was found to have a good tissue quality and fulfilling the inclusion criteria, it will be repaired using fiberwires and anchored to the femoral condyle using SwiveLock screw. If the ACL found irreparable, then it will be reconstructed using hamsting tendons graft. A minimum of 20 patients will be included in each group. Post-operatively, the patients will undergo a specific rehabilitation program and will be followed up for, at least, one year to determine their activity level, functional level, subjective knee function, range of motion, stability, and failure of the repair. The activity level will be evaluated using Tegner activity score, which is a scale that aims to provide a standardized method of grading work and sporting activities. It describes the current level of activity and that before injury. The score varies from 0-10; a score of 0 represents sick leave or disability pension because of knee problems, whereas a score of 10 corresponds to participation in national and international elite competitive sports. The functional state will be graded using Lysholm scale, which is designed to assess how the knee problems have affected the patient's ability to manage in everyday life. It consists of 8 items that assess: pain (25 points), instability (25 points), locking (15 points), swelling (10 points), limp (5 points), stair climbing (10 points), squatting (5 points), and need for support (5 points). Every question response has been assigned an arbitrary score on an increasing scale. The total score is the sum of each response to the eight questions, and may range from 0-100. The scores are categorized as: Poor (\<65); Fair (65-83); Good (84-90); and Excellent (\>90). Both scales will be translated into Arabic; then back-translation will be done into English, all by experts, to ensure absolute quality and accuracy. The subjective knee function will be graded as poor, fair, good, and excellent. The knee stability/anterior laxity will be assessed using ADT, Lachman's test, and pivot shift test. The ADT is graded as: * Negative (0) * +1: \<5 mm translation, * +2: 5 to 10 mm, * +3: \>10 mm translation. The Lachman's test is graded as: * Negative (0), * Slight (1+): \<5 mm of displacement, * Moderate (2+): 5 to 10 mm, * Severe (3+): \>10 mm compared with that of the normal knee. The pivot shift is graded as: * Negative (0) * Trace positive (1+), * Moderate shift (2+), * Subluxation (3+). The patients will be evaluated by an independent observer. The participants' data, including the personal information, will be kept safe and secure. The date will be anonymised with ID numbers. The hard copies will be in a locked filing cabinet and the soft copies will be securely password protected. The data will only be accessed by the agreed members of the research team. These records are not to be transferred to or shared with any other institute. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) will be used for the statistical analyses. Data collection and entry will be done by trained personnel. To assess relationship between variables: as univariate analysis, we will use Chi-square, t-test, ANOVA or non-parametric tests according to the nature of data. The nonparametric analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) will be used to determine the significance of the overall difference in the outcome measures among the two groups at a particular follow-up time-point. Paired comparisons among the two groups at each time-point will be made with use of the Mann-Whitney test. The Wilcoxon test for paired data will also be used to test for the significance of the changes in the outcome measures for a particular group between any two time points. Also, odd ratio will be calculated, where applicable. As adjusted multivariate analysis, we will use logistic regression. Relations between variables will be assessed by correlation coefficient. Feasibility of the project This study is going to be a pilot study. Its primary mission is to provide immediate knee stability, resolve the pain and avoid long-term complications via simple and straightforward arthroscopic ACL repair. It is an evolving procedure and its results are promising. ACL injuries are common and the procedures are being done by one experienced orthopedic surgeon. The assessment scales that will be used are validated and have been used internationally in previous studies yielding valid information. To the investigator's knowledge, there is a dearth of studies looking into the outcomes of arthroscopic primary ACL repair and this is going to be the first study in the Middle East. Therefore, conducting this research project will yield reliable and helpful results; will elucidate the previously abandoned facts about acute ACL repair; and will eventually have a huge impact in the field of orthopedic surgery.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT03510845,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03510845,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03510845&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Aim of the present study was to compare the early post-operative activity, restoration of gait pattern and functional results after DIS in comparison with primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) for acute ACL tears. It was hypothesized that functional results, post-operative activity and changes in gait pattern after DIS are comparable to those after ACLR.METHODS: Sixty patients with acute ACL tears were included in this study and underwent either DIS or ACLR with an anatomic semitendinosus autograft in a randomized manner. Patients were equipped with an accelerometric step counter for the first 6 weeks after surgery in order to monitor their early post-operative activity. 3D gait analysis was performed at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Temporal-spatial, kinematic and kinetic parameters were extracted and averaged for each subject. Functional results were recorded at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after surgery using the Tegner activity scale, International Knee Documentation Committee score and Lysholm score.RESULTS: Patients who underwent DIS showed an increased early post-operative activity with significant differences at week 2 and 3 (p = 0.0241 and 0.0220). No significant differences between groups were found for knee kinematic and kinetic parameters or the functional scores at any time of the follow-up. Furthermore, the difference in anterior tibial translation was not significantly different between the two groups (n.s.).CONCLUSION: Early functional results and changes in gait pattern after DIS are comparable to those of primary ACLR.

The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the effect of a combined, progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise intervention on knee muscle strength, functional capacity and hamstring muscle-tendon morphology in ACL-reconstructed patients with persistent hamstring muscle-strength deficiency compared with controls. Methods/design: The study is designed as a multicenter, parallel-group RCT with balanced randomization (1:1) and blinded outcome assessments (level of evidence: II) and will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT Statement. Fifty ACL-reconstructed patients (hamstring auto-graft) with persistent limb-to-limb knee-flexor muscle-strength asymmetry at 12-24 months' post surgery, will be recruited through outpatient clinics and advertisements. Patients will be randomized to a 12-week progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise group (SNG) with supervised training twice weekly or a control intervention (CON) consisting of a home-based, low-intensity exercise program. Outcome measures include between-group change in maximal isometric knee-flexor strength (primary outcome) and knee-extensor muscle strength, hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratios of the leg that has been operated on and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (secondary outcomes). In addition, several explorative outcomes will be investigated: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), the Tegner Activity Score, rate of force development (RFD) for the knee flexors and extensors, tendon regeneration and potential muscle hypertrophy at graft harvest site evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postural control, kinetic/kinematic gait characteristics and knee-related functional capacity. Discussion: This RCT is designed to investigate the effect of combined, progressive-resistance and neuromuscular exercises on knee-flexor/extensor strength, in the late rehabilitation phase following ACL reconstruction. Reduced hamstring strength represents a potential risk factor for secondary ACL rupture and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis. If deemed effective, the intervention paradigm introduced in this study may help to improve current treatment strategies in ACL-reconstructed patients.

Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 40 patients with an isolated rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee. The MRI findings on the tendon graft were evaluated at 6 months and 12 months after the surgery in a total of 33 patients, namely in 10 women/23 men (21 right knee/12 left knee), with the mean age of 29.1 years and at the mean follow-up of 15.9 weeks after the injury. The randomisation using envelopes was carried out at the beginning of arthroscopy either in the group with the PRF application (Group 1) (17 patients) or in the group without the PRF application (Group 2) (16 patients), the followed-up patients underwent the ACLR with targeting the femoral tunnel through anteromedial portal using the autografts of m. semitendinosus and m. gracilis with Tightrope femoral fixation and Inion implant in tibia. In Group 1, during the surgery PRF was applied both in the drilled tunnels (intraosseously) and directly to the surface of the tendon graft itself (intraarticular part). The Group 2 was a control group in which the same intervention was performed, however without the PRF application. In the 6(th) and 12(th) month after the surgery, the signal intensity of the knee and occurrence of the ACL graft failure, bone (marrow) oedema rate near the tunnels were assessed by an independent radiologist using a 3 Tesla MRI. RESULTS In the 6(th) and also in the 12(th) postoperative month, neither a complete, nor a partial graft failure was found in the group with PRF, whereas in Group 2 a complete or a partial graft failure was observed in 12.5% (p = 0.23). In the 6th month, a bone marrow oedema near the intraosseous parts of the graft was reported in 94.1% of patients in Group 1 and in 81.3% of patients in Group 2, while in the 12th month it was 23.5% of evaluated patients in Group 1 and 37.5% patients in Group 2. The differences between the two groups were not statistically significant in the 6th (p = 0.096) or in the 12th month (p = 0.43). In the 6(th) month, a fully ligamentised graft was found in 52.9% of patients in Group 1 and in 37.5% of patients in Group 2 (p = 0.061), a partially ligamentised graft was present in 47.1% of patients in Group 1 and in 50% of patients in Group 2. In the 12(th) month, a fully ligamentised graft was seen in 94.1% of patients in Group 1 and in 75% of patients in Group 2 (p = 0.26) and a partially ligamentised graft was present in 5.9% of patients in Group 1 and in 12.5% of patients in Group 2. In the remaining 12.5% of patients in Group 2, the finding was assessed as a graft with no signs of ligamentisation. DISCUSSION We have not encountered a paper in the Czech or world literature which would present results of a similar study, i.e. which would evaluate the potential benefits of the platelet-rich fibrin application in the course of the anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Majority of studies evaluate the benefits of the application of platelet-rich plasma aimed to achieve a positive effect on the LCA graft healing. CONCLUSIONS Our study proved a higher percentage of ligamentisation and healed grafts into the bone as well as a lower occurrence of graft failure in the group with PRF compared to the group without the PRF application, namely both in the 6th and in the 12th month. Nonetheless, the differences between the two groups assessed at the same time were not statistically significant.",,,,English,English,20180794595,30383531,L624866580,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L624866580&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=00015415&id=doi:&atitle=Evaluation+of+the+MRI+findings+on+a+tendon+graft+after+the+anatomic+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction+in+patients+with+versus+without+the+application+of+platelet-rich+fibrin+-+Results+of+the&stitle=Acta+Chir.+Orthop.+Traumatol.+Cech.&title=Acta+Chirurgiae+Orthopaedicae+et+Traumatologiae+Cechoslovaca&volume=85&issue=5&spage=343&epage=350&aulast=Zeman&aufirst=P.&auinit=P.&aufull=Zeman+P.&coden=ACOTA&isbn=&pages=343-350&date=2018&auinit1=P&auinitm=,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Although a BTB autograft is widely recognized to offer high mechanical performance and rapid graft healing, these advantages come at the cost of a longer surgery time and higher risk of severe patient discomfort at the graft harvest site. Use of a hamstring tendon autograft is less painful, but is generally slower to heal with higher risk of mechanical graft failure due to poor bone ingrowth. The aim of the current study is to augment graft-to-bone incorporation by use of an osteoconductive scaffold enlaced into the hamstring tendon autograft. This bovine derived composite bone substitute is inserted into the articular aperture of the femoral bone tunnel and should provide an osteoconductive / osteoinductive environment at a biomimetic attachment site leading to improved secondary graft-fixation and a reduced incidence of tunnel widening. Primary objective of the study is to evaluate efficacy of the surgical technique for ACL reconstruction using an osteoconductive scaffold, enlaced into the hamstring tendon autograft, compared to the traditional technique. Secondary objectives aim to assess the clinical outcome of the interventional treatment including patient subjective knee function and objective measures of knee stability.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT03462823,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03462823,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03462823&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Methods Fifty-one patients underwent anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction with metal interference screws in the femur and biocomposite interference screws in the tibia. Standardized digital radiographs with weight-bearing anteroposterior and lateral views of the index knee were taken in the early postoperative period and at 2 and 5 years postoperatively. Of 51 patients, 40 (78%) underwent radiographic assessment on all 3 occasions. Subjective and objective clinical assessments were obtained preoperatively and at the 5-year follow-up. Results The mean follow-up period was 65 months (±3.9 months), with a minimum of 59 months. The width of the tibial tunnel on the anteroposterior view was 9.4 mm (±1.4 mm) in the early postoperative period and 9.2 mm (±1.5 mm) at 5 years (P =.64). The corresponding widths on the lateral view were 9.6 mm (±1.5 mm) in the early postoperative period and 9.0 mm (±1.4 mm) at 5 years (P =.014). In 33 of 40 patients (83%) the width of the tibial tunnel had decreased on 1 or both views at 5 years compared with the early postoperative period. The study group had improved significantly at the 5-year follow-up compared with the preoperative assessments in terms of the KT-1000 arthrometer laxity tests (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), pivot-shift test, Tegner activity scale, and Lysholm knee score (P <.001). No correlations were found between the tunnel widths and the KT-1000 assessment.

Methods: This study included 31 patients with ACL injury who underwent ACL reconstruction via the SB (n = 16) or the DB (n = 15) technique. Isokinetic and concentric strength measurements of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were conducted at postoperative 6 months and postoperative 8 years, and 3D-CT scans of the knee joints were performed on the 2nd, 3rd and 6th month, and the 8th year postoperatively. Clinical evaluations were performed at 8 years postoperatively with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, and Lysholm knee scoring systems. Results: There was marked widening of the parts of the femoral tunnel close to the knee joint in both the SD and the DB groups. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of clinical results and isometric muscle strength at postoperative 8 years; however, there was a significant difference between the preoperative and 6 months postoperative clinical and strength results in both group (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and anterior drawer test at postoperative 8 years. On evaluation of the anteromedial bundles alone, the DB group had greater widening than the SB group. Conclusion: In this study, we have found that the tunnels continue to enlarge after 6 months.

Box 81745-319, Isfahan, Iran.","Background: The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the patellar versus hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, fifty patients undergoing arthroscopic ACL reconstruction were randomized into two equal groups: Those treated with either autogenous patellar tendon grafts (PT group) or HT group grafts. All patients were reviewed immediately after surgery, at 6 and 12 weeks after surgery, and then at 6 months using the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form. Infection, severity of pain (visual analog scale), duration of rehabilitation, and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were assessed at the 6-month follow-up. Positive pivot shift and Lachman test were considered clinical signs and symptoms of treatment failure. In addition, the absence of the ACL or transverse ACL rather than the posterior oblique ligament is an MRI finding that indicates treatment failure. Results: Comparing changes in pain and range of motion (ROM) in patients first and 6 months after therapy show that pain had been relief significantly (P < 0.001) and ROM dramatically changes (P < 0.001). The average rehabilitation period in the PT group was 13.2 ± 2.08 weeks whereas in the HT group, it was 9.28 ± 2.26 weeks. A significant difference was seen between the two groups in terms of the rehabilitation period (P < 0.001). No significant difference was found in the normal ROM between the groups (P = 0.32). When the pain severity was considered, a significant difference was found between the PT group and the HT group (P < 0.001). The HT group patients had less knee pain than did the PT group patients. No significant difference in infection rates was seen between two groups (P = 0.66).

The participants were randomly assigned to either the Pilates exercise group (n = 24) or the control group (n = 26). The subjects in the Pilates exercise group performed basic mat exercises that focused on the muscle strength and flexibility of the lower limbs and core muscles during each class session, which met three times per week for 12 weeks. The control group did not receive any treatment or home exercise programme. All patients were evaluated using the Lysholm Knee Scale, the Cincinnati Knee Rating System, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring strength. Patient satisfaction regarding improvement in knee stability was assessed using the Global Rating of Change scale.RESULTS: The Pilates group experienced significant improvement over the control group as measured by the difference in quadriceps strength at 12 weeks (p = 0.03). Both groups showed some clinical change over time, but the Pilates group improved for all outcome measurements at the 12-week follow-up, and the control group only improved for functional outcomes. Patient satisfaction with the level of knee stability based on the Global Rating of Change scale was higher in the Pilates group than in the control group.CONCLUSION: Although both groups exhibited improvements in knee strength and functional outcomes, the results suggest that Pilates is a superior management approach over a control treatment for increasing quadriceps strength in participants with partial ACL injury. Pilates may provide clinicians a novel option when choosing a treatment for a partial ACL injury. Further study is needed to determine whether certain subgroups of individuals might achieve an added benefit with this approach.II.",,,,English,English,,26231151,L621047142,10.1007/s00167-015-3718-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-015-3718-1,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L621047142&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14337347&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-015-3718-1&atitle=The+effectiveness+of+Pilates+for+partial+anterior+cruciate+ligament+injury&stitle=Knee+Surg+Sports+Traumatol+Arthrosc&title=Knee+surgery%2C+sports+traumatology%2C+arthroscopy+%3A+official+journal+of+the+ESSKA&volume=25&issue=8&spage=2357&epage=2364&aulast=%C3%87elik&aufirst=Derya&auinit=D.&aufull=%C3%87elik+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2357-2364&date=2017&auinit1=D&auinitm=,Copyright 2018 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Date of Publication: 24 May 2017,clinicaltrials.gov,2017,,,,,24-May-17,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryStudy Aims and Objectives: To investigate the following null hypothesis: that there is no difference in clinical and functional outcome when comparing outcomes of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction when comparing femoral side graft fixation with either a fixed versus an adjustable suspensory loop system. The research team will achieve this aim by: * Enrolling 150 patients into this study over a period of 2 years and 8 months * Carrying out a prospective randomised study looking at the subject matter over a period of 5 years and 8 months * Analysing patients functional status pre and post-surgery using patient generated questionnaires * Quantitatively measuring knee joint laxity using the KT1000 testing device at the 3, 6 and 12 month post-surgery time frames * Collating the data received into a spread sheet for analysis by a professional statistician. It is not uncommon to tear the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) particularly during sporting activities. Younger and sportier patients will often have this ligament reconstructed so as to allow them to return to sport with a stable knee joint that they feel they can trust. Various surgical techniques exist to perform ACL reconstruction. In Exeter, the favoured technique is to reconstruct the ligament by taking two of the hamstring tendons from the back of the knee and creating a graft with these, passing them through a bony tunnel to replace the torn ACL. On the shin bone side of the knee the graft is fixed in place using a screw. On the thigh bone side, the graft is attached to a device known as a suspensory loop. The length of the graft and the length of the tunnel in the thigh bone vary from patient to patient. It is important to get a good length of the graft material in both the shin and thigh bones so as to give the best chance of the graft attaching to the surrounding bone. With the fixed loop system, once the metal button attached to the outer thigh bone is in place, the length of the loop cannot be adjusted. Thus the amount of hamstring graft in either end of the bony tunnel cannot be changed. One potential advantage of an adjustable loop system is that the amount of graft in either end of the bone tunnel can be altered to ensure sufficient graft is accurately placed. The research team are planning to run this study to identify which type of loop system gives the best outcome for patients, examining the results in different ways including questionnaires to measure how well the patients feel their knee is performing, and specific tests to measure knee function. If patients consent to be in the study, they will be randomly allocated to receive one of the 2 ACL reconstruction options above and their progress monitored for 2 years after the operation. All aspects of surgical care will be as routine practice apart from the decision to fix the graft to the thigh bone with an adjustable or fixed suspensory loop.Detailed DescriptionResearch Question: In the treatment of patients requiring anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, is there any difference in clinical and functional outcomes for patients when comparing femoral side graft fixation using a fixed loop versus an adjustable suspensory loop system? Study Aims and Objectives: 1. To investigate the following null hypothesis: that there is no difference in clinical and functional outcome when comparing outcomes of ACL reconstruction when comparing the use of a fixed versus an adjustable suspensory loop system. 2. To identify the optimal surgical technique for patients requiring ACL reconstruction surgery. The research team will achieve these aims by: * Enrolling 150 patients into this study over a period of 2 years and 8 months * Carrying out a prospective randomised study looking at the subject matter over a period of 5 years and 8 months * Analysing patients functional status pre and post-surgery using patient generated questionnaires * Quantitatively measuring knee joint laxity using the KT1000 testing device at the 3, 6 and 12 month post-surgery time frames * Collating the data received into a spread sheet for analysis by a professional statistician Background: ACL rupture is a common injury. The National Ligament Registry (NLR) report (2016) details that 2585 patients with this injury were added to the Registry between 31/01/15 and 31/01/16. Of these, 1851 (71.6%) underwent reconstruction surgery and 734 patients (28.4%) were treated non-operatively. There is no clear consensus as to the best surgical technique for this procedure. However, one of the commonest techniques used is that involving the use of hamstring autograft- 95% of ACL reconstructions in Sweden in 2012 were performed using this method and 88% in the UK in 2015. A tunnel is drilled through the distal femur and proximal tibia, and the ACL graft passed through the tunnel. With this hamstring autograft method, various methods exist for fixing the graft on the femoral side- interference screws, transfemoral suspensory devices and femoral suspensory devices. There is no consensus as to which is best. Rehabilitation after this type of surgery has become more aggressive over the years with early full weight-bearing, range of motion and strengthening exercises beginning soon after surgery. It is essential to preserve the initial stability of the graft whilst healing of the graft to the surrounding bony tunnel occurs so as to provide maximal benefit from the surgery for the patients. This healing process can take up to 12 weeks. Failure of an ACL reconstruction can take different forms with graft stretching, graft failing to incorporate, traumatic re-rupture and infection being the most frequent causes. The assessment of ACL reconstruction failure can be performed in different ways. Samitier et al report the knee may demonstrate objective laxity (as tested by clinical tests such as Lachman and Pivot Shift or mechanical tests such as the KT1000). There may be a patient perception of instability even though objective tests are satisfactory). Using the KT1000 arthrometer, Alford and Bach report the rationale for a maximum manual side-to-side difference of 3 mm when assessing anterior tibial translation or an absolute laxity of 10 mm in the injured knee as the diagnostic criteria for ACL deficiency. Patient recorded outcome measures such as the Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner activity scale and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective questionnaire are all validated and can be used to assess satisfaction with surgical outcome and functional ability. Suspensory fixation devices are used to draw the graft in to the femoral tunnel. Tunnel lengths differ between patients as do graft lengths. With a fixed length suspensory loop, once the metal device to fix the graft in the femoral tunnel has been deployed, it cannot be adjusted. In theory, fixed length suspensory loops may result in insufficient graft in the femoral tunnel. Whilst fixed suspensory loops are available in a multitude of sizes to overcome this problem, this will necessitate keeping a large stock of differing size products available in the operating theatre which will incur cost repercussions. With an adjustable suspensory loop, the graft can continue to be pulled up into the femoral tunnel even after the fixation button is attached to the outer femoral cortex giving the operating surgeon greater intra-operative flexibility. This will allow a greater amount of graft to be drawn within the femur. If one can have a short length of suspensory loop and a greater amount of graft in the tunnel, there will be less motion of the graft in the tunnel and a greater ability of the graft to unite to the surrounding bone. If the harvested graft is unexpectedly found to be short, the adjustable loop may offer a further advantage to the surgeon over the fixed loop. In this situation, if the fixed loop is deployed, there may be a sub-optimal amount of graft in the tibial tunnel. Thus, there is less graft for the interference screw to engage against for fixation on the tibial side. In these circumstances, the ability for the surgeon to lengthen the loop, and pull some extra graft into the tibia will allow for better fixation of the graft on the tibial side. Presently, the fixed loop devices are available in varying sizes. Keeping a range of different sized products in stock to cover graft length issues, will incur extra costs. A benefit of an adjustable loop system may be therefore, that it will only require the single size product to be kept on the shelf, with an implication for cost savings in terms of amount of stock that needs to be on hand. There have been several biomechanical studies comparing the strength and lengthening of fixed versus suspensory loop devices in a laboratory environment. In particular, assessment is made of the lengthening of the suspensory loop when subject to repetitive cyclic loading and also of ultimate failure when subject to load to failure testing. Varying results have been reported. Petre et al showed 4 suspensory loops had ultimate failure tolerances that would exceed the forces that an ACL graft would be subjected to. However, on repetitive cyclic testing one of the adjustable length suspensory loops stretched in excess of 3mm which was beyond the threshold which would be considered a clinical failure. Eguchi et al reported a fixed loop suspensory device as having greater statistically significant strength and lower total displacement/ stretching values by comparison to an adjustable loop device. Barrow et al similarly found that the ultimate load to failure of all 3 devices tested (fixed and adjustable loops) exceeded the forces likely to be experienced in a patient's knee during the early postoperative rehabilitation period. They also reported the adjustable loop devices lengthening to a clinically significant degree when subject to cyclic loading. However, they reported this lengthening significantly reduced for one adjustable loop device when the free suture ends were tied. Barrow and Petre's papers examined loop strength and failure rates in a laboratory environment using a mechanical device for loop testing. Eguchi's work included testing loops fixed to porcine femurs and bovine femurs. Whilst recognised as models for such biomechanical testing, neither test scenario replicates the in-vivo situation that an ACL graft will face in human tissue. The only clinical study comparing the loops was published by Boyle et al in 2015. In this retrospective study, the results of 188 patients were compared for 73 patients with an adjustable suspensory loop and 115 with a fixed loop. At varying time intervals of follow- up, no clinically statistically significant different outcomes were identified using stability testing via the KT1000 device and nor were differences found in graft failure. This study however, was not a prospective randomised study and has methodological flaws. In particular, there is a potential for bias in interpreting the assessment of the pivot shift and Lachman tests post-operatively as this was carried out by the operating surgeons who were not blinded to the type of surgery undertaken. Data was available for all 188 patients at the 6 month post-operative time frame- by which time graft healing should have occurred. However, only 58.5% of patients had data at 1 year follow-up and only 11.2% of patients achieved 2 year follow up. The graft diameter was statistically significantly larger in the adjustable loop cohort which can affect graft healing. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, this study outlined there was no detriment to using the adjustable loop system compared to the fixed loop in a clinical setting. Thus the evidence of load to failure strength for all types of loop appears satisfactory, whilst some makes of adjustable loop appear to lengthen beyond acceptable levels in a laboratory situation after cyclic testing. We have carried out independent biomechanical testing of the loops being examined in this study and both met requirements for not lengthening excessively after cyclic loading and having pull to failure strength measurements in excess of those than would occur in daily life. This clinical study therefore, aims to examine if there is any difference in clinical and functional outcome for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction using a hamstring autograft in a group of patients having a fixed length suspensory device used on the femoral side versus a group with an adjustable length one. It will be the first purely clinical prospective randomised study of these type of loops with the assessors of both clinical tests and the KT1000 device blinded as to which type of surgery the patient has undergone. Methodology: A randomised, prospective, study is to be set up to compare the results of 2 different ways of undertaking femoral fixation in ACL reconstruction surgery. One arm of the study will be randomised to have their surgery using a fixed length suspensory loop device for achieving femoral side graft fixation, and the other to have an adjustable suspensory loop used. The study will be carried out in the operating theatres, orthopaedic out-patients department and the physiotherapy department at the Royal Devon and Exeter (RD+E) Hospital. Patients will be invited to take part in the study in one of 2 ways. Firstly, by their surgeon when they are initially listed for ACL reconstruction surgery at their out-patient consultation at the RD+E Hospital orthopaedic department. Alternatively, if they are identified from the current surgical waiting list as suitable for inclusion. In this latter case, they will be contacted by letter by their surgeon asking for permission for one of the research team to contact them to discuss the study. All participants will be sent a copy of the patient information leaflet. At their preparation for surgery appointment- usually 2-4 weeks before their operation, they will meet one of the research team who can answer any questions about the study. A study consent form will be signed at this meeting if the patient is willing to be involved in the research Patients who agree to enter the trial will be divided at random to enter the different treatment arms of the study. The randomization schedule will be determined using an on-line random assignment sequence generator (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm) and will be kept and controlled by the study co-ordinator, and the surgeons will not have access to this schedule. The randomisation details for each patient will be written on to a slip of paper and placed inside an opaque envelope. Each envelope is attributed to one patient and given a study number. One of the research team (study coordinator or research nurse) will supply the operating theatre staff with one of the envelopes containing the slip of paper upon which will be written the randomisation allocation for the patient undergoing surgery at that time. The operating theatre staff will inform the surgeon of the allocation. 150 patients will be initially included with allocation to either arm of the trial. The operating surgeon will not be able to read the slips before the envelope is opened, nor will they perform the randomisation which will be carried out by one of the investigators not carrying out the surgery on the individual patients i.e. the operating surgeon takes no part in the randomisation process. Sample Size: In 2015, at the RD+E Hospital 75 ACL reconstruction procedures were undertaken. 35 cases were performed at Sidmouth hospital giving a total of 110 per annum. Lanzetti's paper (Ref 11) indicated that the mean and Standard Deviation (SD) values using the KT-1000 to measure Antero-Posterior (AP) translation of the tibia in relation to the femur were as follows: Group a Group b KT 1000 Manual maximum 2.3+/-0.9 2.5+/-1 side to side difference (millimetres-mm) 2.1+/-1.2 2.3+/-1 Based on these values the study was powered to detect a Minimum Clinically Important difference (MCID) of 0.6 mm, which would shift the KT-1000 reading from 3.0 mm (upper bound of satisfactory level) to 3.6 mm (0.6 mm above the satisfactory upper bound). Justification: If the true minimum difference (or Minimal Clinically Important Difference) between the experimental and control group KT-1000 measurement means is 0.6mm the researchers will need to recruit 60 cases in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means are equal with probability (power) 0.9, type I error rate of 5% (significance) and mean SD of 1.0 (Lanzetti paper referred to above) An adjustment of 20% to account for drop outs would increase the number in each group to 75 and the total sample size to 150 cases. Data Analysis: Results of all the primary outcome between the 2 groups will be analysed at the 12 month time frames using students t-test to compare the groups. A stats package such as SPSS version 24 software will be used (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois) for analysing the results. Procedure: Potential candidates for this study will be identified in one of 2 ways. Firstly, when patients are listed for ACL reconstruction surgery whilst attending orthopaedic out-patient clinics at the RD+E Hospital. At the time of this consultation they will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study. They will be given a copy of the information about the study and the consent form. They will have the opportunity therefore, to discuss the study with their family, friends or General Practitioner (GP) if they wish to do so. It will be explained that a member of the research team will contact them by telephone or letter to ask if they wish to participate in this research. Alternatively, patients will be identified from existing surgical waiting lists. In this case, they will be contacted by their surgeon in writing asking for their permission for one of the study team to approach them about the study. If permission is given, the patient will be sent a copy of the participant information sheet and a consent form so that they can decide if they would like to be involved. One of the research team- either the study coordinator or one of the research nurses- will then contact the patient and if they are willing to be involved, will obtain written consent for study participation. Consent is will be obtained at the preparation for surgery appointment which usually occurs 2-4 weeks before surgery. 3 copies of written consent will be obtained. One will be returned to the patient. One will be placed in the medical notes and one will be kept by the research team in the patient's case record file (CRF). Patient Generated Clinical Outcomes/ Pre-operative Functional Assessment: All ACL reconstruction patients attend the hospital for routine pre-operative assessment-whether involved in the study or not. At this appointment-usually 2-4 weeks before their operation- trial participants will complete the questionnaires related to the study: the Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee questionnaire, the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire and the Tegner activity score. Initial Radiological Assessment: Most patients will have undergone a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) scan of the affected knee prior to surgery as part of routine care. This test is not performed on all patients having this type of surgery, and is not one of the procedures being examined in this study; hence it is not necessary for every patient to undergo this. Randomisation: Randomisation will be to one of 2 arms of the study. The patient will either receive: 1. An ACL reconstruction using a fixed length suspensory loop for femoral fixation, or 2. An ACL reconstruction using an adjustable length suspensory loop for femoral fixation Tibial fixation for all participants will be as per routine care with an appropriately sized interference screw. Patients who agree to enter the trial will be divided at random to enter the different treatment arms of the study. The randomization schedule will be determined using an on-line random assignment sequence generator (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm) and will be kept and controlled by the study co-ordinator, and the surgeons will not have access to this schedule. The randomisation details for each patient will be written on to a slip of paper and placed inside an opaque envelope. Each envelope is attributed to one patient and given a study number. One of the research team will supply the operating theatre staff with one of the envelopes containing the slip of paper upon which will be written the randomisation allocation for the patient undergoing surgery at that time. The operating surgeon will not be allowed to open the envelope. The patient will be assigned the study number and their randomisation slip returned to the study coordinator to be kept with the Masterfile copy of the consent form. A hand written note will be made by one of the research team in the orthopaedic section of the patient's medical notes after their surgery, confirming that they consented to the study and detailing which arm of the study they were allocated to. Surgery: Operating techniques will be standard ACL reconstruction techniques using hamstring autograft as used by the 2 surgeons involved in the study. The operating surgeon will record in the operation note evidence of meniscal damage, cartilage and ACL status, including presence of any residual ACL. Immediate Post-operative Care: Patients will be discharged home allowed to fully weight-bear as comfort allows with walking aids for use for a 2 week period. They will be discharged wearing a locked knee brace. They will be reviewed at 2 days after surgery for a wound check and brace removal. They will be instructed in closed kinetic chain knee exercises, range of motion exercises, advised on cryotherapy and referred to the physiotherapy department for a formal ACL rehabilitation programme which will begin 2-3 weeks after surgery. This is all routine care in the researcher's institution. Follow Up: As per routine care, the patients will be followed up in the orthopaedic clinic at 2 and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-operatively. At the 6 month, 1 and 2 year timeframe they will repeat the KOOS, IKDC subjective knee score, Tegner Activity score and the Lysholm Knee questionnaire. These can be completed and posted from home by the patients or when they attend for KT1000 testing- see below. Functional assessment using the KT1000 device will also be carried out at the 3 and 6 month and 1 year follow up time frames. Physiotherapy will continue as clinical need dictates- as per routine care. If possible, all patients will undergo their rehabilitation at the RD+E Hospital to ensure standardisation of care. However, there will be practical logistical reasons why all patients will not be able to do this and they will have to have their physiotherapy in their local hospital. Post-operative Radiological Assessment: All participants will get a single Antero-Posterior (AP) and Lateral X-ray of the operated knee on the day of surgery as per routine care. Data Storage The KOOS, IKDC subjective knee score, Tegner Activity Score and the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire are all undertaken by patients. This is in paper format and transcribed onto an Excel spread sheet on an RD+E Trust computer. The results of the KT1000 measurements will be also put on the spread sheet. The data will remain the property of the RD+E Hospital. All of the remaining data associated with the study will be kept electronically on the hard drives of computers within the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU). These are encrypted and password protected hospital computers. The data will only be accessible by members of the research team and the study sponsor who will need access for research regulatory purposes. The data will be analysed and reported. The study Masterfile will be kept in the EKRU offices-an area that is inaccessible to the general public and for which staff require keypad door access. Data Collation: To be undertaken by the clinician undertaking the specific procedure concerned, the study coordinator or by research nurses attached to the Research and Development (R+D) department in the RD+E Hospital. The data will be stored on RD+E Hospital secure computers. Data will be entered into an Excel spread sheet for later transfer into a statistical package such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 for analysis. All patient identifiers will be removed. The study data will be kept until the study analysis has been completed and then archived in accordance with the archiving Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the study sponsor. Data analysis: Will be carried out by an appropriately qualified statistician. Personnel: * Chief Investigator-Andrew Toms (ADT) * Surgeons-Vipul Mandalia (VIM) and Peter Schranz (PZS) * Study coordinator-Patrick Hourigan (PGH) * Functional outcome assessment team-Dean Chisling De Burgh (DCDB) -physiotherapy department RD+E Hospital. * Database support provided by David Searle- surgical care practitioner in the EKRU. * Clerical staff attached to the EKRU. Confidentiality: All of the research staff will be trained in guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in research. All National Health Service (NHS) staff involved are bound by patient confidentiality requirements of the NHS. The study participants General Practitioner (GP) will be informed that their patient is involved in the research- particularly as the patient may wish to discuss their involvement in the research with their GP. All of the data associated with the study will be kept electronically on the hard drives of computers within the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU). It will be stored on encrypted and password protected hospital computers. The data will only be accessible by members of the research team and by the R+D department at the RD+E Hospital who will require access to the data to ensure compliance with the protocol. When the data is to be sent to the statistician for analysis, it will be anonymised and only a study number used for identification. The statistician uses password and encrypted computers. At the end of the study (see timescales below), all research data will be archived in line with the sponsors SOPS. Radiographs and scans will remain on the secure hospital systems as per routine care. Timescales: Approximately 110 ACL reconstructions carried out per annum by the surgeons within the research team. Allowing 50% declining recruitment, not meeting entry criteria or missed for logistical reasons this will leave 55 potential participants per annum. Thus recruitment should be in approximately 2 years and 8 months. Follow up is for 2 years post entry into the study as outlined above. It will take a further 1 year for data analysis, project write up and submission for publication post study end. Study data will be archived as per the study sponsors archiving SOP's after completion of the study. Dissemination of Results: The participants will be informed in writing of the results if they so desire. The R+D department at the RD+E will be informed of the results. The research team plan to present the results both nationally and internationally at knee surgery conferences and to publish the results in a peer reviewed journal. The team will also present the results to the 2 patient networks in Exeter: The Patient Research Panel and The Patient Knee Support Group Impact of Results: The impact of this study as yet is unknown. If the research identifies a clear advantage of one study arm over the others, then it is likely that this technique will become the standard ACL reconstruction procedure within the RD+E Hospital- with the aim of providing patients with the best clinical and functional results after their ACL reconstruction surgery. Similarly, if a clear difference is found in one study arm, one would hope that presentation of the results to colleagues at other institutions will result in better long term results for their patients. In the event that no technique proves superior to the others, then this will provide surgeons with the reassurance that no matter what their preferred technique, their patient is not being disadvantaged. If results between both arms of the study are the same, there is a potential cost saving for the NHS if only one size of adjustable suspensory loop needs to be kept in stock a opposed to multiple different sizes of the fixed loop device. Conflicts of Interest: The Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit has received external funding to allow them to undertake studies as this. This is subject to a Masters Service Agreement (MSA) and the monies are already in place. Both devices being studied are made by the same company and thus using one or the other is of no financial benefit to the manufacturer. ADT and VIM undertake consultancy work for Stryker UK and will complete the necessary paperwork for this. Patient Involvement: The research team have consulted with patients on the feasibility of participating in the study at all and in particular about the demands of attending the appointments for functional assessment. The commitment for the majority of the study is the same whether patients are involved in the research or not but nevertheless the research team will emphasise the need for attendance. However, rehabilitation for patients living in Exeter is undertaken at the RD+E site. For some patients who live in the surrounding areas, rehabilitation could normally be undertaken in their local community hospital using current protocols. Ideally the research team would like all patients to attend for rehabilitation at the RD+E so as to standardise care. However, this will not always be possible as patients may have logistical difficulty travelling to Exeter when the study population is drawn from a wide geographical area. If patients do not wish or cannot travel to Exeter for this however, they will have to come to Exeter on 3 extra separate occasions for the KT100 functional test. Attendance at all time frames is critical for completion of the functional outcome assessment. This is both the study primary outcome measure but also the safety net of ensuring neither study arm is failing catastrophically. It was stressed by the patient representatives that the patients need to be fully informed of the commitment required should they agree to take part. The research team have consulted on the design and wording of the patient information leaflet and the consent form. Various changes were recommended in particular to the patient information leaflet- all were implemented. Risks of the Study: The research team do not believe involvement in this study changes the risks from surgery that the patients already face as a part of routine care. Monitoring Adverse Events/Stopping the Study: A log of adverse events will be kept by the study coordinator. Adverse events occurring in the immediate peri and post-operative events should be reported to the coordinator by the consultant surgeon in charge of the case. Adverse events may be identified in clinic and again, the surgeon concerned should report these back to the coordinator to be logged and further action considered if necessary after discussion with the study sponsor. It is possible that adverse events will occur that are dealt with either by the Accident and Emergency (A+E) department, the patient's GP or other hospitals. These may not be readily apparent to the research team. The research team will therefore specifically ask participants to inform their surgeon if any complications or adverse events occur and similarly ask the surgeons to specifically ask their patients for this information at each clinic attendance. A meeting of the research team will be held on a 3 monthly basis to discuss progress of the study, any specific problems and to consider whether there are any justifications for stopping the study. As both techniques being studied of performing ACL are already part of routine practice, the research team do not anticipate identifying an unexpected complication that would necessitation an early termination of the study.

The results are considered independent by the choice of the graft and the fixation devices. A growing interest on resorbable non-metallic fixation devices versus standard metallic fixation devices has been noted over recent years with few clinical experiences reported in the literature. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendons with tibial fixation by a centrally placed resorbable screw and sheath to a combination of an eccentrically placed resorbable interference screw and supplementary staple fixation.METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing an isolated, single-bundle, primary ACL reconstruction with autologous hamstring tendons, using the same femoral fixation, were randomized to a tibial fixation with a centrally placed resorbable screw and sheath, BioIntrafix (group A), or an eccentrically placed resorbable interference screw, BioRCI, and two non-resorbable staples (group B). The latter has represented for many years our standard fixation method. Clinical evaluations (KOOS, IKDC, KT-2000™ side-to-side difference) and radiological analyses were conducted in both groups with a minimum follow-up of 2 years.RESULTS: We assisted in a satisfactory pain relief and functional improvements, without significant clinical and radiological differences in both groups. No further surgery was needed in patients with the screw/sheath tibial fixation. Seven patients with the screw/staples tibial fixation needed the surgical removal of the fixation devices due to pes anserinus irritation or local infection years after the index operation. Other parameters such as the tunnel enlargement were not statistically different in the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Good clinical and radiological outcomes of ACL reconstruction by a screw/sheath tibial fixation have been reported showing comparable results with respect to screw/staples fixation. There were no failures associated with loss of fixation with either of tibial fixation methods. A fewer number of surgical removals of tibial devices were also recorded in patients treated by the screw/sheath fixation system, related to the absence of local intolerance or infection compared to subjects with a standard tibial fixation.",,,,English,English,,27120190,L618850552,10.1007/s00167-016-4135-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-016-4135-9,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L618850552&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14337347&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-016-4135-9&atitle=Resorbable+screw+and+sheath+versus+resorbable+interference+screw+and+staples+for+ACL+reconstruction%3A+a+comparison+of+two+tibial+fixation+methods&stitle=Knee+Surg+Sports+Traumatol+Arthrosc&title=Knee+surgery%2C+sports+traumatology%2C+arthroscopy+%3A+official+journal+of+the+ESSKA&volume=25&issue=4&spage=1264&epage=1271&aulast=Carulli&aufirst=Christian&auinit=C.&aufull=Carulli+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1264-1271&date=2017&auinit1=C&auinitm=,Copyright 2017 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Methods: From August 2008 to April 2012, 91 patients of consecutive cases were diagnosed as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury associated with stable ramp lesion in Department of Sports Medicine Service of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital. All of the diagnosis was confirmed during arthroscopic surgeries. The patients were randomized into suture repair group and control group. The ACL was reconstructed using auto grafts of hamstring. MRI was used for evaluation of the healing of the ramp lesion during the follow-up period. The stability of the knee joint was evaluated using KT-1000 device. The clinical functional outcomes were analyzed with Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee(IKDC) score. t test and χ(2) test were used to analyze the data, respectively. Results: There were 73 patients (80%) were available for final follow-up. The follow-up period was 24 to 72 months (mean (38.9±16.1) months). The suture repair group included 40 patients, while the control group included 33 patients. There were no statistically difference in age(t=0.458, P>0.05), gender(χ(2)=0.222, P>0.05), time interval from injury(t=0.643, P>0.05) and associated injuries(χ(2)=0.658, P>0.05). At the final follow-up, the healing rate of ramp lesion in suture repair group was 97.5% (95% of complete healed, 2.5% of partial healed, and 2.5% of non-healed), in control group the healing rate was 93.9% (87.8% of complete healed, 6.1% of partial healed, and 6.1% of non healed), there were no significant differences between the two groups (χ(2)=0.446, P>0.05). There was no statistically significant difference of postoperative knee stability (t=-0.510, P>0.05).

Date of Publication: 23 Feb 2017,clinicaltrials.gov,2017,,,,,23-Feb-17,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryA rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a severe injury of the knee. The current gold Standard treatment for young and active patients with instability, is a surgical ACL reconstruction. However, there still is no consensus on which graft is best suited for this.The aim of the current multi-center randomized controlled trial was to investigate the hypothesis that an anatomic single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a (flat) quadriceps tendon autograft is at least as effective as reconstruction of the ruptured anterior cruciate ligament with a patella tendon autograft or a hamstringtendon autograft, in terms of failure, measured 2 years postoperatively. Failure is defined gedefinieerd as pathologicai laxity, complaints of knee instability in the absence of any pathological laxity and/or discontinuïty ofthe graft on MRl or arthroscopy.Detailed DescriptionA rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a severe injury of the knee. The current gold Standard treatment for young and active patients with instability, is a surgical ACL reconstruction. However, there still is no consensus on which graft is best suited for this. Paradigms on the different types of auto grafts and their weaknesses and benefits originate mostly from the eighties and nineties, when the patella tendon was being replaced by the hamstring graft as the 'new' gold standerd. Nowadays, the philosophy of isometrie tunnel placement has been abandoned, and has been replaced by the philosophy of anatomie reconstructions. The question then arises: Are the results of the comparative studies, and the current paradigms, still applicable, now that the philosophy has transitioned from isometric to anatomic tunnel placement? Irrespective of the disadvantages compared to the patellatendon autograft, such as a higher re-rupture and revision percentage when used in patients under 25 years old, the hamstring autograft is currently the most used graft for ACL reconstruction worldwide. The question then arises: is it justified that the hamstringgraft is the most used graft worldwide? Rehabilitation protocols are often not, or poorly, described, despite it's significant effect on the outcome and co morbidity of an ACL reconstruction. Especially anterior knee pain, which is often mentioned as a disadvantage of the patellagraft, is significantly influenced by rehabilitation protocols. The introduction and implementation of a nation-wide evidence-based rehabilitation protocol in The Netherlands created uniformity of rehabilitation treatment, and the possibility to generalize scientific conclusions. The question then arises: Due to new insights in rehabilitation and implementation of new protocols, is the anterior knee pain, the often mentioned disadvantage ofthe patelia tendon graft, stiil a relevant disadvantage? The quadriceps tendon autograft is a less often used graft. Nevertheless, research has shown that it seems like a good alternative for the patella tendon and hamstring autograft. Functional outcome is similar, while less donorsite morbidity is reported compared to the patellatendon and hamstring autograft. The question then arises: Is it fair that the quadriceps tendon is rarely used as an autograft for ACL reconstruction? Increasing knowledge of the anatomy of the ACL results in new insights in the methods to achieve true anatomie ACL reconstruction. New arguments support the use of the patella tendon - and even the quadriceps tendon - over the use of the hamstringgraft, because their anatomic similarities to the anterior cruciate ligament might be better suited to restore knee kinematics. The question then arises: are the flat-shaped patella tendon autograft and quadriceps tendon autograft better suited to restore the anatomy of the ruptured ACL than the round hamstring graft? Hypothesis Tlie hypothesis is that anatomic reconstruction ofthe ruptured anterior cruciate ligament with a (flat) quadriceps tendon autograft is at least as effective as reconstruction of the ruptured anterior cruciate ligament with a patella tendon autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft, in terms of failure, measured 2 years postoperatively. Failure is defined as pathological laxity, complaints of knee instability in the absence of any pathological laxity and/or discontinuïty of the graft on MRl or arthroscopy. Objective of the study: Primary objective: To investigate the hypothesis that an anatomic single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a (flat) quadriceps tendon autograft is at least as effective as reconstruction of the ruptured anterior cruciate ligament with a patella tendon autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft, in terms of failure, measured 2 years postoperatively. Failure is defined gedefinieerd as pathologicai laxity, complaints of knee instability in the absence of any pathological laxity and/or discontinuïty of the graft on MRl or arthroscopy. Secondary objectives: patiënt reported outcome measures (PROMs), clinimetrics, radiological assessment, duration of rehabilitation necessary for return to sports and daily activities and the level of sport activities to which the patiënt returned, in patients treated with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a patellatendon autograft, hamstringtendon autograft of quadricepstendon autograft, as measured in the short-term (6 weeks, 6,9,12 months postoperatively), mid-term (2 years postoperatively) and long-term (5 and 10 years postoperatively).

To correlate single-hop for distance with self-reported knee function, strength and psychological factors for ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation to discover whether any of these factors can predict the others.Detailed DescriptionAims: 1) To investigate subjective measures, objective measures, functional performance and psychological factors for ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. Hypothesis: 1-a There will be no differences between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation, and return to sport criteria leg symmetry index (LSI ≥ 85%), in functional performance for single-hop for distance tests 1-b There will be no differences between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation, and return to sport criteria leg symmetry index (LSI ≥ 85%), in objective measures of quadriceps and hamstring isometric muscle strength tests. 1-c There will be no differences between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation, and return to sport criteria (LSI ≥ 85%) in subjective measures of self-reported knee function (KOOS) and (IKDC) 1-d There will be no differences in psychological factors for the anterior cruciate ligament return to sport after injury scale (ACL-RSI) between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation and the cut-off score for return to sport (score ˃ 63). 1-e There will be no differences in the psychological factors for the Tampa scale of kinesiophobia between ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation and the cut-off score of fear of movement (score ≤ 37). 2) To investigate the relationship between self-reported knee function, isometric muscles strength, single-hop test and psychological factors post ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis: 2-a There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and isometric muscles strength in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-b There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and single-hop test in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-c There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and psychological factors in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-d There will be a correlation between isometric muscles strength and single-hop test in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-e There will be a correlation between isometric muscles strength and psychological factors in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-f There will be a correlation between single-hop test and psychological factors in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. Study Procedure After the participants confirm that they are interested in the study, they will be seen again at the rehabilitation class during their regular hospital appointment. During the participants' last visit to the rehabilitation department, they will be briefed again about the study, and if they agree to partake, they will be asked to sign the consent form. Self-reported knee function The participants will be asked to complete the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire on symptoms, stiffness, pain, function daily living, function sport sand recreational activities and quality of life, and The International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC) questionnaire, which assesses symptoms, function, and sports activity. Psychological factors The participants will be asked to complete The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (fear of movement) (TSK) which is a questionnaire that assesses pain related fear of movement followed by the Anterior Cruciate ligament Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scales, which is a questionnaire that measures athletes' emotions, confidence in performance, and risk appraisal concerning to returning to sport following an ACL injury. A demographics form (age, height and weight) will also be completed. Isometric muscle strength To gather isometric muscle strength data on each participant, data on isometric muscle strength for both legs will be obtained using two different tests for knee extensors and knee flexors muscles, using a hand-held dynamometer (HHD). The participants will be asked to wear sports clothing. The strength of both lower limbs of the participants will be assessed using the HHD, with peak force measured throughout five seconds of muscle contraction. Quadriceps muscles will be measured by first requesting the participants sit on the edge of the treatment bed with their knees 90 degrees flexion and both feet off the ground. The participants will then be asked to apply maximum force in extending the knee joint against the HHD device, which will be fixed using a belt and placed in front of the leg proximal to the ankle joint. They will be asked to do so for five seconds, and to repeat three times with 30 seconds of rest in between. The maximum peak force will be recorded throughout the three trials. To measure hamstring muscles, participants will be instructed to sit on the edge of the treatment bed with 90 degrees' flexion in the knee with both feet off the ground. Then, participants will be instructed to apply maximum force to flex knee joint against the immovable HHD device that will be fixed with a belt and placed at the back of the leg proximal to the ankle joint. They will be asked to so for five seconds, and this will be repeated three times with 30 seconds of rest in between. Maximum peak force will be recorded throughout the three trials. Functional tasks Participants will be requested to perform a single-leg hop for distance, and this will be assessed using a standard metric tape measure. A 3m strip of tape will be placed on the floor, with the start line labelled using a 0.3m strip of tape placed perpendicular to the 3m strip of tape. The participants will be performed three practice trials for the hop test. After finishing the practice trials, four test trials will be asked to perform a single leg hop for distance as described by (Bolgla and Keskula, 1997). Attempts will be classified as successful provided the participant hops and lands with full stability on one leg for three seconds. The participants will be required to achieve four maximum hop attempts with complete stabilisation after landing for three seconds. Attempts will be deemed unsuccessful if the participant hops and touches the ground with their other leg during landing, or if they fail to hop within the limited marked distance; any failed hops will be counted and noted, but not processed. The participant's leg length will be measured while they are lying in a supine position before the first test using a standard tape measure to measure from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the distal tip of the medial malleolus. Leg length will be used during data analysis to normalise excursion distances. The participants will begin with their toe on the starting line, standing on one leg, before hopping as far as they can horizontally and landing on the same leg, and the distance hopped will be recorded. The hop data will be normalised to limb length by dividing the distance covered by the participant's leg length and then multiplying by 100, resulting in a percentage value. After completing the test, the participants will be asked to repeat the procedure with the other leg.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT03047187,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03047187,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03047187&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Methods Ninety eight subjects undergoing primary ACL reconstruction were randomized to HT (n = 47) or TA (n = 51) allograft. Subjects completed validated (PRO) measures pre-operatively, and six months and two years post-operatively. Arthrometric testing was performed at six months to assess integrity of the reconstruction. Results Fifty-eight percent of subjects (57/98) completed a two-year follow up. Allograft re-tear rates were similar between groups (6.2% HT vs. 4.0% TA, respectively, p = 1.0). The relative risk of re-tear in the HT group was 1.5 compared to the TA group (p = 0.7).

The investigators have designed this randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the main purpose to investigate the effect of a targeted muscle strength exercise intervention on the neuromuscular rehabilitation of ACLR-patients compared with 'care-as- usual'. The study is designed as a prospective, superiority, parallel-group with balanced randomization (1:1) RCT (Level of evidence: II) with blinded allocation, and outcome assessment according to the CONSORT statement (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). 50 patients with ACL reconstruction and persistent hamstring muscle deficiency, will be recruited at the outpatient clinic 1-year follow-up, and allocated to one of two 12 weeks' interventions, either a) the supervised progressive strength and neuromuscular exercise group (SNG) with supervised training twice weekly. Or b) the control group (CON) receiving patient education based on a home-based exercise regime of low intensity, defined as 'care as usual'. Outcome measures include, maximal isometric knee flexor muscle strength (primary outcome), knee extensor strength, and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (secondary outcomes). In addition, the following explorative outcomes will be investigated; hamstring to quadriceps strength ratios, the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate tendon regeneration of the hamstrings and finally kinetic/kinematic biomechanical outcomes of knee related functional tasks. To the investigators knowledge, this is the first RCT to investigate the efficacy of combined progressive resistance training and neuromuscular exercise in the late rehabilitation phase in patients demonstrating persistent limb-to-limb knee muscle asymmetry following ACLR. Reduced hamstring strength represents a potential risk factor for secondary ligament rupture and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis (OA). If deemed effective, the intervention paradigm introduced in this study may help to improve current treatment strategies.Detailed DescriptionDetailed study description available in the published study protocol: ""The effect of targeted exercise on kneemuscle function in patients with persistent hamstring deficiency following ACL reconstruction - study protocol for a randomized controlled trial"".

Despite the type of reconstruction chosen, the detached HG undergoes a remodeling process known as ligamentization. In order to shorten the ligamentization process, the maintenance of HG tibial insertion, aimed to spare the tendons vascular supply, has been postulated. The aim of this paper is to report the results of a prospective randomized study comparing clinical and MRI results between two different ACL reconstructive procedures with and without HG tibial insertion preservation. Methods: Forty patients (mean age 27.5 ± 9.5 years) were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. The study group underwent an ACL reconstruction using a distally inserted HG, while the control group underwent a technique encompassing HG tibial detachment. Subjective and objective IKDC score was administered preoperatively and at 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up. Graft morphology was assessed through MRI evaluation performed at 6-month follow-up. Results: Clinical results were excellent in both groups. Regarding MRI results, a better intra-articular graft morphology was observed in the study group (Tau = 0.313, p = 0.024). No differences in graft integration were noticed. Conclusion: The main finding of this preliminary study is that preservation of the hamstring tibial insertion seems to enhance graft ligamentization with improved morphology of the intra-articular portion of the graft compared to a detachment of the hamstring tendons from the tibial side. Further well-designed studies with higher number of patients as well as more serial MRI evaluations are required to validate these preliminary findings.",,,,English,English,20160517174,27388213,L611200889,10.1007/s00590-016-1812-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00590-016-1812-9,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L611200889&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14321068&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00590-016-1812-9&atitle=Hamstring+graft+tibial+insertion+preservation+versus+detachment+in+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+a+prospective+randomized+comparative+study&stitle=Eur.+J.+Orthop.+Surg.+Traumatol.&title=European+Journal+of+Orthopaedic+Surgery+and+Traumatology&volume=26&issue=6&spage=657&epage=664&aulast=Ruffilli&aufirst=Alberto&auinit=A.&aufull=Ruffilli+A.&coden=EJOTF&isbn=&pages=657-664&date=2016&auinit1=A&auinitm=,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The 2 laxity-based tension protocols were (1) to restore normal anteroposterior (AP) laxity at the time of surgery relative to the contralateral uninjured knee (low-tension group) or (2) to overconstrain AP laxity by 2 mm relative to the contralateral uninjured knee (high-tension group). The hypotheses were that (1) the high-tension group would have improved outcomes and decreased OA compared with the low-tension group after 84 months, and (2) the outcomes for the high-tension group would be equivalent to those for an age-, sex-, race-, and activity-matched group of control participants with uninjured knees.STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.METHODS: Patients had their ACLs reconstructed with either a bone-patellar tendon-bone or 4-stranded hamstring autograft, and outcomes were compared with a matched control group. Outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at 60 and 84 months postoperatively and included clinical (KT-1000 arthrometer AP laxity measurement and International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] examination score), functional (1-legged hop for distance and knee extensor torque), patient-reported (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], Short Form-36 [SF-36], and patient satisfaction survey), and OA imaging (measurement of joint space width [JSW], Osteoarthritis Research Society International [OARSI] radiographic score, and Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score [WORMS]) components. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to evaluate differences in outcomes between the treatment groups and the control group.RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 2 tension groups in 1 of 5 KOOS subscales (sports and recreation; P = .04) and 2 of 8 SF-36 subscales (vitality, mental health; P < .04) at 84 and 60 months, respectively. Both tension groups scored significantly worse than the control group in the IKDC examination (P < .001), 1-legged hop (P ≤ .017), KOOS quality of life and symptoms subscales (P < .03), and OARSI radiographic score (P ≤ .02) at 84 months. The low-tension group performed significantly worse than the control group on the KOOS pain subscale (P = .03), SF-36 general health and social functioning (P < .04), OARSI radiographic score (P < .001), and WORMS (P = .001), while the high-tension group had statistically different results than the control group in AP knee laxity (P < .001), radiographic JSW (P = .003), and OARSI radiographic score (P = .02) as well as significantly more subsequent knee injuries (P = .02) at 84 months.CONCLUSION: The results do not support the hypotheses that the high-tension group would have improved outcomes when compared with the low-tension group after 84 months of healing or that the outcomes for the high-tension group would be equivalent to those for the matched control group. While there were minor differences in patient-reported outcomes between the 2 laxity-based tension groups, all other outcomes were similar.REGISTRATION: NCT00434837.",,,ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00434837),English,English,,27159308,L618900641,10.1177/0363546516638387,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546516638387,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L618900641&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546516638387&atitle=Effect+of+Matching+or+Overconstraining+Knee+Laxity+During+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction+on+Knee+Osteoarthritis+and+Clinical+Outcomes%3A+A+Randomized+Controlled+Trial+With+84-Month+Follow-up&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=44&issue=7&spage=1660&epage=1670&aulast=Akelman&aufirst=Matthew+R.&auinit=M.R.&aufull=Akelman+M.R.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1660-1670&date=2016&auinit1=M&auinitm=R,Copyright 2017 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

All reconstructions were performed anatomically by identifying the ACL footprints, using the anteromedial portal for the femoral tunnel drilling, and utilizing interference screw for tibial and femoral fixation. A single blinded observer examined the patients preoperatively and at follow-up (median, 64 months; range, 55-75 months). Multiple subjective and objective clinical evaluation tests and radiographic assessments of osteoarthritis (OA) were performed using the Ahlbäck, Kellgren-Lawrence, and Fairbank grading systems at 6 weeks postoperatively and at the final follow-up evaluation.RESULTS: Preoperatively, no differences were found between the study groups, apart from the preinjury Tegner activity level, which was lower in the DB group (SB: mean, 7.8 [range, 3-9]; DB: mean, 7.3 [range, 0-9]; P = .02).

Between these two grafts might be differences in stability, morbidity, or long-term changes. This study investigates outcomes of ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon versus semitendinosus tendon autografts. We hypothesize no significant differences in clinical outcome and knee stability between both groups. Methods: In a randomized prospective trial, we operated 62 ACL-deficient patients, 45 males and 17 females with a mean age of 29.8 years (min. 18, max. 44). We reconstructed the ligament using either autologous patellar tendon (n = 31) or semitendinosus tendon (n = 31). After 10 years of follow-up, we investigated 47 patients of the study. For evaluation we used a standard clinical examination including one-leg jump test and KT-1000 instrumental translation measure, visual analog pain scale, IKDC subjective knee form, Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and standard X-rays of the knee. Results: The data did not show any significant differences between the two groups. Between 5 and 10 years after ACL reconstruction both groups started to develop degenerative arthritic changes, which were detectable in standard radiographs of the knee. At 10-year follow-up mean IKDC for the BPTB group was 1.8 (min. 1, max. 3) and for the ST group it was 2.2 (min 1, max. 4), p = 0.35. Regarding Tegner activity scale after 10 years, the BPTB group showed a mean score of 5.9 (min. 4, max. 9) versus 5.1 (min. 3, max. 7) in the ST group, p = 0.53. For the Lysholm score the BPTB group reached a mean of 92.0 (min. 63, max. 98) and the ST group 91.8 (min. 62, max. 98) points, p = 0.66. There is a tendency for higher donor site morbidity in the BPTB group than in the ST group, p = 0.07. Conclusions: Both, patellar tendon and semitendinosus tendon are safe autografts for ACL reconstruction. Regarding graft selection, individual patient-dependent factors should be considered.

Design: Double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) with intraoperative computer-generated allocation. Setting: University-based orthopedic referral practice. Patients: Three hundred thirty patients with isolated ACL defi-ciency were equally randomized to (1) patellar tendon (PT; mean, 29.2 years), (2) quadruple-stranded hamstring tendon (HT; mean, 29.0 years), and (3) double bundle using HT (DB; mean, 28.8 years). Three hundred twenty-two patients completed 2-year follow-up. Interventions: Anatomically positioned primary ACL reconstruction with PT, HT, and DB autografts. Main Outcome Measures: Proportions of complete traumatic reruptures, traumatic reinjuries (complete reruptures and partial tears), atraumatic graft failures, and contralateral ACL tears. Logistic regression assessed 5 a priori determined independent predictors: chronicity, graft type, age, sex, and Tegner level. Results: More complete traumatic reruptures occurred in the HT and DB groups: PT = 3; HT = 7; DB = 7 (P = 0.37).

The autologous semitendinosus-gracilis graft at the affected side or the allogeneic anterior cruciate ligament was implanted into the knee joint in autologous tendon graft group or allogeneic tendon graft group, respectively. Lachman test results, Lysholm and Larson scores of joint function, and postoperative immune rejection were observed and assessed during 2-year follow-up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Lysholm and Larson scores in autologous tendon graft and allogeneic tendon graft groups were significantly increased after the reconstruction compared with before the reconstruction; however, there was no difference in the scores between both two groups at 2 years after the reconstruction (P > 0.05). At the end of the follow-up, the normal function of the knee joint was restored, and no lag and flexion constraint of the knee joint were observed. No significant differences were observed in Lachman test results between both groups (P > 0.05). Compared with the autologous tendon graft group, immune rejection rates were higher in the allogeneic tendon graft group; however, no significant differences were observed between both groups (P > 0.05). In summary, the allogeneic tendon graft may be a candidate for the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament due to its similar clinical curative effect to the autologous tendon graft and low immune rejection rates.",,,,Chinese,"English, Chinese",20170525562,,L617442047,10.3969/j.issn.2095-4344.2016.15.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.2095-4344.2016.15.009,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L617442047&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=16738225&id=doi:10.3969%2Fj.issn.2095-4344.2016.15.009&atitle=Reconstruction+of+the+anterior+cruciate+ligament+by+allogeneic+tendon+graft%3A+Clinical+curative+effect+and+immune+rejection&stitle=Chin.+J.+Tissue+Eng.+Res.&title=Chinese+Journal+of+Tissue+Engineering+Research&volume=20&issue=15&spage=2190&epage=2196&aulast=Tu&aufirst=Ze-Song&auinit=Z.S.&aufull=Tu+Z.S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2190-2196&date=2016&auinit1=Z&auinitm=S,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Knee homeostasis after injury and surgery is crucial for rehabilitation and knee well-being. We examined if effusion was affected by post-operative bracing, and if patients with effusion fit into a common profile. Methods: Patients were randomized to wearing or not wearing a post-operative brace for three weeks after ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus-gracilis tendons. Knee joint effusion was detected by computed tomography in 60 patients (22 women), before and three and 12 months after surgery. Joint effusion, clinical and subjective tests were analyzed. Results: This is the first prospective, randomized study on post-operative bracing for patients with a semitendinosus-gracilis graft showed that bracing had no effect on three-months presence of joint effusion. Excessive joint effusion was present in 68% of the patients three months after surgery and was associated to prior meniscus injury (p = 0.05) and higher prior Tegner activity level (p = 0.006). We found a positive association between longer time from injury to surgery and joint effusion three months post-operatively (rho = 0.29, p < 0.05). Twelve months post-operatively, joint effusion had diminished to baseline levels. Subjective scores and activity levels were lower for women. Three-months joint effusion predicted lower final outcome scores in women. Conclusion: Prior meniscus injury and pre-injury Tegner activity levels are predictive significant variables for excessive knee joint effusion after ACL reconstruction. Post-operative bracing had no effect. A larger clinical cohort is needed to confirm findings of this logistic regression.

Titanium and poly-L-lactic acid with hydroxyapatite (PLLA-HA) screw outcomes have been compared only to 2 years.PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of the PLLA-HA screw versus titanium screw for hamstring tendon ACLR over a 5-year follow-up period. The hypothesis was that there are no differences in clinical scores or tunnel widening between the PLLA-HA and the titanium screws and that the PLLA-HA screw as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should show high-grade resorption and ossification response over 5 years.STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.METHODS: A total of 40 patients undergoing ACLR were randomized to receive either a PLLA-HA screw (PLLA-HA group) or a titanium screw (titanium group) for ACL fixation. Blinded evaluation was performed at 2 and 5 years with the International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm knee score, KT-1000 arthrometer, single-legged hop test, and MRI to evaluate tunnel and screw volumes, periscrew ossification, graft integration, and cyst formation.RESULTS: There was no difference in any clinical outcome measure at 2- or 5-year follow-up between the 2 groups. At 2 years, the femoral tunnel in the PLLA-HA group was smaller than that in the titanium group (P = .02); at 5 years, there was no difference. At 2 years, the femoral PLLA-HA screw was a mean 76% of its original volume, and by 5 years, it was 36%. At 2 years, the tibial PLLA-HA screw mean volume was 68% of its original volume, and by 5 years, it was 46%. At 5 years in the PLLA-HA group, 88% of femoral tunnels and 56% of tibial tunnels demonstrated a significant ossification response. There was no increase in cyst formation in the PLLA-HA group and no screw breakages.CONCLUSION: There were equivalent clinical results between the PLLA-HA and titanium groups at 2- and 5-year follow-ups. The PLLA-HA screw was not associated with increased tunnel widening or cyst formation when compared with the titanium screw.

Design: Double-blinded, randomized clinical trial with intraoperative computer-generated treatment allocation. Patients and an independent trained evaluator were blinded. Setting: University-based orthopedic referral practice. Patients: Three hundred thirty patients (14-50 years; 183 male patients) with isolated ACL deficiency were equally randomized to: (1) patellar tendon, PT: 28.7 years (SD = 9.7); (2) quadruple-stranded hamstring tendon, HT: 28.5 years (SD = 9.9); and (3) double bundle using HT, DB: 28.3 years (SD = 9.8); 322 patients completed 2-year follow-up. Intervention: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using PT, HT, or DB autografts. Main Outcome Measures: Measured at baseline, 1 and 2 years postoperatively - primary: anterior cruciate ligament quality-of-life scores; secondary: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, KT-1000 arthrometer, pivot shift, range of motion, Tegner activity, Cincinnati Occupational Scale, and single-leg hop.

The purpose of this study was to examine and compare clinical outcome measures of ACL reconstruction using semitendinosus autograft (ST) versus semitendinosus + gracilis (ST/G) reconstructive techniques.METHODS: In a double-blind randomized clinical study, 19 patients with an ACL tear underwent either ST (59) or ST/G (61) and observed for 1 year. Both patients and the final examiner were unaware as to the type of graft received. Patients were evaluated according to subjective criteria, functional assessment tests, knee isometric torques, knee laxity using KT-2000 and knee range of motion.RESULTS: The study included 21 (17.6 %) female and 99 (82.4 %) male patients with a mean age of 29.9 ± 7.8 in the ST group and 32.4 ± 6.3 in the ST/G group. There were no significant differences found in surgical complications; IKD; Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; Lysholm; strength of the knee isometric flexors; and flexion and extension loss between the two groups. At the final visit, 86.9 % of ST group and 89.6 % of ST/G group had side-to-side difference of laxity <3 mm (n.s.).CONCLUSIONS: Since anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadrupled ST is more technically demanding than doubled STG and with there being no difference in outcomes and complications, no compulsory advice should be made on the former technique. However, gracilis harvesting may not be necessary based on the function and strength of the knee.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Randomized controlled trial, Level I.",,,,English,English,,24531357,L606351385,10.1007/s00167-014-2890-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-014-2890-z,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L606351385&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14337347&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-014-2890-z&atitle=Role+of+gracilis+harvesting+in+four-strand+hamstring+tendon+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+a+double-blinded+prospective+randomized+clinical+trial&stitle=Knee+Surg+Sports+Traumatol+Arthrosc&title=Knee+surgery%2C+sports+traumatology%2C+arthroscopy+%3A+official+journal+of+the+ESSKA&volume=23&issue=4&spage=1086&epage=1091&aulast=Karimi-Mobarakeh&aufirst=Mahmoud&auinit=M.&aufull=Karimi-Mobarakeh+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1086-1091&date=2015&auinit1=M&auinitm=,Copyright 2015 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

One of the most important negative prognostic factors that markedly increase the risk for ACL re-tear is the presence of high knee-abduction moment (KAM), which can be measured immediately by landing on both feet after a vertical jump. We evaluated the effect in postoperative values for KAM according to the type of graft used for ACL reconstruction (hamstring vs patellar tendon) and a specific rehabilitation protocol focusing on recovery of muscular strength, proprioception and joint stabilisation.Methods: From November 2010 to September 2012, we enrolled 40 female recreational athletes with clinical and imaging evidence of ACL tear and randomised them in two groups. One group of patients underwent reconstruction with a hamstring-tendon graft and the second with a patellar-tendon graft. A custom rehabilitation programme focusing on proprioception was adopted. Clinical outcomes [International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores] and performance in functional test for stability (single-leg hop, timed hop, crossover triple hop, KAM test) were assessed preoperatively at three and six months postoperatively.Results: All patients showed statistically significant clinical improvements postoperatively when compared with preoperative values (P < 0.0001). No significant intergroup difference was observed in all clinical scores and functional tests, with the exception of the value registered for the KAM test (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: ACL reconstruction using patellar-tendon graft followed by rehabilitation centred on strength, proprioception and stability restoration can produce satisfactory values for KAM within the physiological range.

Methods Seventy-eight patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with an autologous semitendinosus tendon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: SB reconstruction (n = 39) and DB reconstruction (n = 39). In both groups, grafts were fixed at 30° of flexion with a total tension of 80 N. The following evaluation methods were used: clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) measurement, muscle strength, Tegner activity score, Lysholm score, subjective rating scale regarding patient satisfaction and sports performance level, graft retear, contralateral ACL tear, and additional meniscus surgery. Results Fifty-three patients (25 in SB group and 28 in DB group) who were followed up for a minimum of 3 years (mean, 69 months; range, 36 to 140 months) were evaluated. Preoperatively, there were no differences between the groups. Postoperatively, the Lachman and pivot-shift test results were better in the DB group (P =.024 and P <.0001, respectively). KT measurements were better in the DB group (mean, 1.4 mm v 2.7 mm; P =.0023). The Tegner score was also better in the DB group (P =.033). There were no significant differences in range of motion, muscle strength, Lysholm score, subjective rating scale, graft retear, and secondary meniscal tear. Conclusions In ACL reconstruction using the transtibial approach, DB reconstruction was significantly better than SB reconstruction regarding anterior and rotational stability during the 3- to 12-year follow-up. The results of KT measurements and the Lachman and pivot-shift tests were significantly better in the DB group, whereas there was no difference in the anterior drawer test results.

Nevertheless, strong evidence supporting an ideal method for fixation of the ACL graft is lacking.HYPOTHESIS: Intratunnel femoral fixation of the ACL graft via a cross-pin fixation technique would provide better clinical and objective results than the extratunnel femoral fixation with cortical buttons.STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2.METHODS: Seventy patients with a unilateral ACL-deficient knee were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 femoral fixation groups. Group A (35 patients) was fixed with 2 bioabsorbable Rigidfix pins, 1 cross-pin per bundle, while group B (35 patients) was secured with 1 EndoButton cortical button per bundle. All femoral tunnels were created via an anteromedial portal, and a bioabsorbable Biointrafix interference screw was used for tibial fixation for both groups. The evaluation of the patients was performed by history details, clinical examination findings, measurement of the joint laxity by KT-1000 arthrometer, and use of validated patient outcome questionnaires. Statistical analysis was carried out with Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U tests, with P<.05 considered the cutoff level of significance.RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 30 months, 34 and 32 patients of group A and B, respectively, were available for evaluation. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups regarding the subjective and objective outcomes, except for KT-1000 arthrometer values. The median KT-1000 value of patients in the cross-pin fixation group was 1.30 mm, while the median value in the cortical button fixation group was 1.95 mm (P<.001). Four patients with ACL grafts that were fixed with cortical buttons demonstrated failure of stability via the instrumented knee laxity testing, while patients from the other group had no failures.CONCLUSION: Intratunnel femoral fixation of the double-bundle ACL graft from the cross-pin fixation technique provided better instrumented knee laxity results than did the extratunnel femoral fixation with cortical buttons.

When traveling from inside to outside and from top to bottom in the front of the knee, the patellar branch of the saphenous nerve runs parallel to the hamstring tendon. Therefore, to cut the tendon can lead to tibialis anterior skin sensitivity loss. To alter the incision direction may reduce the impact on the anterior tibial skin sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of incisions in different directions for cutting the hamstring tendon on the anterior tibial skin sensitivity in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury admitted from July 2013 to February 2014 were enrolled. These patients underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon, and randomly divided into oblique incision group (n=37) and vertical incision group (n=37). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in the incision length between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with the vertical incision group, the area of skin sensitivity loss was smaller in the oblique incision group at 2 days, 1 month and 3 months after reconstruction (P < 0.05), but after 6 months, there was no difference in the area of skin sensitivity loss and Lysholm scores between the two groups (P > 0.05).

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2014,clinicaltrials.gov,2014,,,,,1-Dec-14,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryTo investigate the hypothesis that suture repair of a ruptured vkb, combined with a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization and microfracture of the femoral notch, results in at least equal effectiveness compared with an ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring in terms of functional recovery one year postoperatively in terms of a patient self-reported outcome related to be able to conduct daily and sporting activities. Secondary, the evaluation of clinical outcomes, self-reported by the patient outcomes, osteoarthritis, rehabilitation time required for return to daily and sporting activities and levels of sporting activity which has returned in patients with status after an ACL rupture and suture repair augmented with a dynamic intraligamentary microfracture and stabilization of the femoral notch in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the ipsilateral hamstring graft.Detailed DescriptionBackground of the study: An anterior cruciate ligament rupture is a serious injury to the knee with high probability of the occurrence of dynamic instability, accompanying lesions and early post-traumatic arthrosis. Despite conservative treatment through rehabilitation or ACL reconstruction surgery not all patients do return to their previous activity levels. Moreover degenerative changes, especially early posttraumatic arthrosis, are not counteracted. In order to optimize the clinical results after ACL surgery, a renewed interest has emerged in healing the patient's own ruptured ACL after attaching. Literature suggests that with the current innovations in surgical repair techniques of (natural) healing of a ruptured ACL may result in similar clinical outcomes in comparison to the gold standard, the ACL reconstruction. In addition, it may even reduce degenerative changes occur in relation to the gold standard. Moreover, the return to daily activities and sports level seems significantly faster than after ACL reconstruction. The hypothesis is that a suture (suture repair) of a ruptured ACL, combined with a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization, as well as microfracture of the femoral notch, passes, at least equal efficacy in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autologous hamstrings in terms of functional recovery 1 years postoperatively. The DIS bonding technique will be applied in the current study to surgically repair (suture) the ruptured ACL. DIS is an abbreviation and stands for intraligamentary dynamic stabilization (DIS). DIS has been used in humans and seems to provide a high patient satisfaction, favorable clinical and radiological results. However, to our knowledge, to date, no randomized comparative study has been conducted yet in which the DIS technique is compared with the gold standard, the ACL reconstruction. Objective of the study: Primary goal: Investigate the hypothesis that suture repair of a ruptured vkb, combined with a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization and microfracture of the femoral notch, results in at least equal effectiveness compared with an ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring in terms of functional recovery one year postoperatively in terms of a patient self-reported outcome related to be able to conduct daily and sporting activities. Secondary objective: Evaluation of clinical outcomes, self-reported by the patient outcomes, osteoarthritis, rehabilitation time required for return to daily and sporting activities and levels of sporting activity which has returned in patients with status after an ACL rupture and suture repair augmented with a dynamic intraligamentary microfracture and stabilization of the femoral notch in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the ipsilateral hamstring graft. Study design: This study is a single center stratified block randomized controlled trial. Patients with ACL rupture, confirmed by an orthopedic surgeon based on the outpatient history and radiographic images, will be randomized into an experimental ('repair' / DIS) group after inclusion and a control (reconstruction, regular care) group. Patients will be stratified on the level of sport/physical active practice, on the basis of the Tegner score. The Tegner score is an evaluative and inventory questionnaire on which the patient indicates the gravity of his work and/or sports activities. A higher score is associated with a higher level of physical strain/activity . On the basis of the Tegner score patients will be stratified into a 'moderate' physically active stratum (group Tegner score 5-6-7) and 'highly' physically active stratum (group Tegner score 8 -9-10). Stratification based on the degree of physical activity is considered to be important because the extent and severity of physical activity/strain in daily life poses a potential (difference) in risk of re-rupture between the two study arms. In order to minimize potential differences in 'exposure' or 'risk of re-rupture' between the two study groups stratification is relevant.Measurements take place at baseline, peri-operative / immediately after surgery, 6 weeks, 3,6,9 months and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years postoperatively. Study population: (Physically) active patients from 18 untill 30 years, who has visited the outpatient clinic of the orthopedic surgeon because of a knee injury resulting in a ACL rupture, for whom surgery indication for an ACL reconstruction exists and who can be operated on within three weeks after the onset of the ACL rupture. Intervention: n=48 patients will participate in the current study. Patients will be assigned to a suture repair of the ruptured vkb complemented by a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) and microfracture of the femoral notch or the gold standard, a ACL reconstruction. Primary study parameters/outcome of the study: Self-reported functional outcome at one-year follow post surgery measured by the IKDC 2000 subjective scale. Secundary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable): Secondaire eindpunten: Self-reported functional outcome at one-year follow post surgery measured by the IKDC 2000 subjective scale 6 weeks, 3,6 and 9 months, 2,5 and 10 years post surgery, self-reported disabilities (KOOS), level of physical activity (Tegner), satisfaction (VAS) as well as IKDC physical examination (clinimetretrics) 6 weeks, 3, 6 en 9 months, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post surgery; instrumented anteroposterior laxity, leg symmetry index for jump tests as well as isokinetic quadriceps en hamstrings force 6 en 9 months, 1, 2, 5 en 10 years after surgery; radiologic signs of arthrosis 1,2 5 and 10 years post surgery; reruptures of the ACL within 10 years post surgery, classification rupture pattern peroperative.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT02310854,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02310854,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT02310854&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

A number of fixation devices are available; however, several have limited clinical support. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled study comparing the EZLoc and the Bone Mulch Screw for femoral fixation in ACL reconstruction exists. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the results following the use of these two femoral fixation devices. Time in surgery for the two methods was also to be compared.METHODS: A total of 110 patients between 18 and 45 years old at two orthopaedic departments, A (n = 55) and B (n = 55), were randomized to ACL reconstruction with femoral fixation of the hamstring graft with either the EZLoc or the Bone Mulch Screw. Surgical time was measured for each group. The patients were evaluated after 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. The clinical examination included range of motion, evaluation of intraarticular swelling, tenderness at the lateral femoral condyle, the Lachman test, the Pivot shift test and the KT-1000 arthrometer. In addition, the visual analogue scale score for pain, the Tegner activity score, the Lysholm functional score and the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score were recorded. Knee extension and flexion muscle strength were also measured with a Biodex.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in any of the parameters mentioned above at the 2-year follow-up evaluation. Three patients in each group underwent revision ACL reconstruction during the study. More than 95% of the knees in both groups were found to be stable. Good to excellent results were found for all selected knee scores in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the muscle strength parameters. Time in surgery was statistically significantly shorter in the EZLoc group compared with the Bone Mulch group.CONCLUSION: There were no statistically significant differences in clinical findings, knee scores or in muscle strength between the EZLoc group and the Bone Mulch group at the 2-year follow-up evaluation. Time in surgery was statistically significantly shorter for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with hamstring grafts when the EZLoc femoral fixation device was used.II.",,,,English,English,,24005332,L603536192,10.1007/s00167-013-2652-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-013-2652-3,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L603536192&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14337347&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-013-2652-3&atitle=Femoral+fixation+of+hamstring+tendon+grafts+in+ACL+reconstructions%3A+the+2-year+follow-up+results+of+a+prospective+randomized+controlled+study&stitle=Knee+Surg+Sports+Traumatol+Arthrosc&title=Knee+surgery%2C+sports+traumatology%2C+arthroscopy+%3A+official+journal+of+the+ESSKA&volume=22&issue=9&spage=2153&epage=2162&aulast=Gifstad&aufirst=Tone&auinit=T.&aufull=Gifstad+T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2153-2162&date=2014&auinit1=T&auinitm=,Copyright 2015 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

This study evaluated the effect of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) on ACL reconstruction in human subjects. We hypothesized that ESWT may improve human ACL reconstruction. Methods Fifty-three patients were randomized into two groups with 26 patients in ESWT group and 27 patients in control group. The ESWT group underwent single-bundle hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction and received ESWT immediately after surgery. The control group underwent ACL surgery without ESWT. Both groups received the same rehabilitation postoperatively. The evaluations included Lysholm score, IKDC score and KT-1000, radiograph, bone mineral density, and magnetic resonance imaging. Results ESWT group showed significantly better Lysholm score than control group at 1 and 2 y postoperatively (P < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was noted in IKDC score between the two groups (P = 0.080 and 0.076, respectively). The KT-1000 values were significantly better in ESWT group than control group at 2 y postoperatively (P = 0.027). The tibia tunnel on X-ray was significantly smaller in ESWT group compared with control group at 2 y (P = 0.018). The bone mineral density values showed no discernable difference between the two groups at 6 mo and 2 y (P = 0.522 and 0.984, respectively). On magnetic resonance imaging, ESWT group showed significant decrease in tibia tunnel enlargement at 6 mo and 2 y compared with the control group (P = 0.024 and <0.001, respectively).

Methods: From 2006 to 2009, a total of 62 patients who underwent single-bundle ACL reconstruction with a quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the preserving-remnant group and the removing-remnant group. Plain radiographs were taken at 1 week, and 3, 6, and 24 months postoperatively, and tibial tunnel enlargement was evaluated. The postoperative clinical assessment included the Lysholm rating scale and KT-1000 measurement. Results: In total, 27 patients in the preserving-remnant group and 24 patients in the removing-remnant group were followed up and the median follow-up was 24.5 months (range 24-27 months). Tibial tunnel enlargement occurred within 6 months postoperatively. Positive enlargement was observed in 8 patients (29.6 %) in the preserving-remnant group and 14 patients (58.3 %) in the removing-remnant group (P = 0.0388). The percentage of tibial tunnel enlargement was 25.7 ± 6.7 and 34.0 ± 8.9 % in the preserving- and removing-remnant groups, respectively (P = 0.0004). In the preserving-remnant group, the average Lysholm score increased from 60.3 ± 5.3 (51-69) to 93.0 ± 3.5 (88-100), and the side-to-side difference of the KT-1000 changed from 6.3 ± 0.9 (5.1-8.0) to 1.4 ± 0.6 (0.5-2.4) mm. In the removing-remnant group, the average Lysholm score increased from 58.7 ± 6.5 (48-71) to 91.1 ± 3.9 (85-100), and the side-to-side difference of the KT-1000 changed from 6.5 ± 0.8 (5.4-8.2) to 1.7 ± 0.6 (0.6-2.8) mm. Conclusions: It is confirmed that remnant preservation in ACL reconstruction can resist tibial tunnel enlargement but that this technique does not affect the short-term clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients with an isolated ACL lesion and the healthy contralateral knee who met the indication criteria for ACL double bundle reconstruction (TISL, 14 mm; ICNW, 12 mm) were intra-operatively allocated at random to either double-bundle group (DB, n=55) or single-bundle group (SB, n=55). At 12 months after surgery, 97 patients (DB group, n=49; SB group, n=48), comprising 68 men and 29 women, were evaluated; the average age was 29.1 years and the injury-to-surgery interval was 15.9 weeks. Pre- and post-operative subjective criteria involved the IKDC and Lysholm score. Objectively, the occurrence of graft failure, range of motion deficit, return to pre-injury sports activity, side-to-side difference in anterior laxity of both knees in 20° flexion on a GNRB laximeter at an applied pressure of 124 N and 250 N, and pivot shift phenomenon were assessed. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found in pre-operative values between the two groups. Post-operatively, there were no significant differences in the occurrence of complete graft failure (p=0.0755; DB group, n=0; SB group, n=3), range-of-motion deficit (p=0.2277-0.9788) or return to pre-operative sports activity (p=0.2322). In the DB group, side-to-side anterior tibial shifts at a pressure of 124 N (medians=1.3 mm and 2.1 mm for DBand SB groups, respectively; p=0.0007) and at a pressure of 250 N (DB group =2.1 mm; SB group = 3.1 mm; p<0.0001) were significantly different from the corresponding values in the SB group. Positive results for the pivot shift test (PST) were significantly less frequent in the DB than the SB group (Chi-square test =0.0112). The SB group patients had a 2.9-times (odds ratio, 2.8704) higher risk of positive postoperative PST results than the DB group patients. In both groups, a comparison of pre- and post-operative criteria showed significant improvement in both the subjective and the objective results. DISCUSSION: The results of this study, in accordance with other authors' conclusions, suggest that the double-bundle technique provides better control over rotational and anterior knee laxity and therefore restores knee biomechanics better. However, other literature data do not confirm any significantly better outcomes of this method. Since only short-term results have been obtained so far, the study will continue because only the long-term results can provide conclusive evidence of an advantage of one technique over the other. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed significantly better restoration of knee rotational and anterior laxity in the patients undergoing anatomical reconstruction of the ACL by the double-bundle technique.

Graft fixations can be achieved during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions by using either bioabsorbable screws or metal screws. The objective of this study was to compare the functional outcomes after bioabsorbable and metallic interference screw fixations in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions done by using hamstring grafts. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, randomized study. Patients in Group 1 received bioabsorbable interference screws and patients in Group 2 received metallic interference screws. Arthroscopic assisted, anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions with the use of hamstring grafts which were fixed proximally with endobuttons and distally with bioabsorbable or metallic interference screws, were undertaken. Progress in functional outcomes was assessed by using Mann Whitney U- test. Functional outcomes in the two groups were compared by using independent t-test. Observation and Results: In each group, there were statistically significant improvements in functional outcomes over successive follow-ups, which were seen on basis on Mann-Whitney U-test. The comparison of functional outcomes between the two groups, done by using independent t-test, showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year of follow-up. p-value <0.05 was considered to be significant in our study. Conclusion:In our prospective study of comparison of functional outcomes between bioabsorbable and metallic interference screws in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstuctions, which were evaluated by using Tegner activity scale and Lysholm knee scoring scale for a period of 1 year, no statistically significant difference was found.

Purpose/ To report the prevalence of OA after ACL reconstruction and to compare the OA prevalence between quadrupled semitendinosus tendon (ST) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts. The hypothesis was that there would be no difference in OA prevalence between the graft types. The secondary aim was to study whether patient characteristics and additional injuries were associated with long-term outcomes. Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Radiological examination results, Tegner activity levels, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) values were determined in 135 (82%) of 164 patients at a mean of 14 years after ACL reconstruction randomized to an ST or a BPTB graft. Osteoarthritis was defined according to a consensus by at least 2 of 3 radiologists of Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥2. Using regression analysis, graft type, sex, age, overweight, time between injury and reconstruction, additional meniscus injury, and a number of other variables were assessed as risk factors for OA 14 years after ACL reconstruction. Osteoarthritis of the medial compartment was most frequent, with 57% of OA cases in the ACL-reconstructed knee and 18% of OA cases in the contralateral knee (P < .001). There was no difference between the graft types: 49% of OA of the medial compartment for BPTB grafts and 65% for ST grafts (P = .073). The KOOS results were lower for patients with OA in all subscales, indicating that OA was symptomatic. No difference in the KOOS between the graft types was found. Meniscus resection was a strong risk factor for OA of the medial compartment (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-9.3) in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. A 3-fold increased prevalence of OA was found after an ACL injury treated with reconstruction compared with the contralateral healthy knee. No differences in the prevalence of OA between the BPTB and quadrupled ST reconstructions were found.

Saunders,"Purpose To compare the tunnel enlargement of double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with and without suturing of autologous ruptured tissue to hamstring graft in patients with subacute anterior cruciate ligament injury. Methods Ten patients with subacute (3 months after injury) anterior cruciate ligament rupture were randomly allocated to undergo DB ACLR with suturing of the ruptured tissue to hamstring graft (n = 5) or conventional DB ACLR (n = 5). When autologous ruptured tissue was used, remnant ruptured tissue was then harvested, divided into 4 pieces, placed between the loops at the distal and proximal portions of the graft, and secured with the suture. As the primary endpoint, tunnel volume assessment by 3-dimensional multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) was performed 1 year after ACLR. To assess the efficacy of these procedures, the Lysholm score, anterior tibial translation (measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer [MEDmetric, San Diego, CA]), and rotational instability (measured by the pivot-shift test) were evaluated after 2 years. Results Tunnel volume enlargement between 3 weeks and 1 year after ACLR as assessed by 3-dimensional MDCT was significantly less for ACLR using ruptured tissue than for conventional ACLR, especially at the femoral site (P <.05). However, the postoperative Lysholm score, anterior stability of the knee measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer, and rate of negative manual pivot-shift test results did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. There was no correlation to the clinical outcomes in terms of tunnel size. Conclusions The Lysholm score, anterior laxity measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer, and rotational instability according to the pivot-shift test did not differ significantly between ACLR using ruptured tissue and the conventional technique. However, ACLR using ruptured tissue produced less femoral tunnel enlargement as assessed by MDCT, warranting further long-term follow-up to elucidate its effectiveness.

Methods and Measures: Thirty-six patients who had a primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) with a semitendinosus-gracilis (STG) autograft from a single orthopedic surgeon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Nineteen patients were randomized to the aggressive group (53% male, mean age 30.1 + 10.5 y) and 17 to the nonaggressive group (88% male, mean age 33.1 + 10.9 y). Impairment measures of anteroposterior (A-P) knee laxity, range of motion (ROM), and peak isometric force (PIF) values were obtained 12 wk postoperatively. Subjective response to the International Knee Documentation Committee knee form (IKDC) was collected 1, 12, and 24 wk postoperatively. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze differences between groups at 12 wk for A-P knee laxity, ROM, and PIF. Differences between the groups for the IKDC scores were determined using 1-way ANOVA with repeated measures 1, 12, and 24 wk postoperatively. Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. Results: There were no differences between the groups for the baseline characteristics (P > .05). There was no difference found between the groups in respect to A-P knee laxity, ROM, or PIF at 12 wk (P > .05). Further analysis also showed no significant differences in the IKDC scores between groups at 12 or 24 wk (P > .05). Conclusions: No differences were found between early aggressive and nonaggressive rehabilitation after an isolated ACL-R using STG autografts for the primary outcomes of A-P knee laxity and subjective IKDC score.

However, no studies evaluate the long-term results of BPTB grafts fixed with metal interference screws and DLSG grafts fixed with the Bone Mulch Screw and the Washer Loc. This prospective randomized multicentre study has the null hypothesis that there is no difference in long-term outcome between the two procedures. Methods: A total of 114 patients with a symptomatic ACL rupture were randomized to reconstruction with either a BPTB graft (N = 58) or a DLSG graft (N = 56). Follow-up was conducted after one, two and seven years. At the seven-year follow-up, 102 of the 114 patients (89%) were available for evaluation; however, 16 of these by telephone-interview only. Results: Ten patients in the BPTB group and 19 patients in the DLSG group underwent additional knee surgery (P = 0. 048), two and three, respectively, of these were ACL revisions (n. s.). The total flexion work was lower in the DLSG group (P = 0. 001). The mean peak flexion torque and extension work, however, showed no difference between the groups. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding the Tegner activity score, the Lysholm functional score, the Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), subjective knee function, anterior knee pain or mobility. There was no significant difference in laxity between the groups on the Lachman test or the KT-1,000 maximum manual force test. Conclusions: Both grafts and fixation methods resulted in satisfactory subjective outcome and objective stability. Both these methods can therefore be considered as suitable alternatives for ACL reconstructions.

To determine if an early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strength in a restricted ROM would promote a clinical improvement without causing increased anterior knee laxity in patients after ACL reconstruction. Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. A total of 49 patients between 16 and 50 years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus and gracilis autografts were randomly assigned to an early start OKC (EOKC) exercise group or a late start OKC (LOKC) exercise group. The EOKC group (n = 25; mean age, 26 years) received a rehabilitation protocol with an early start of OKC (fourth week postoperatively) within a restricted ROM between 45° and 90°. The LOKC group (n = 24; mean age, 24 years) performed the same protocol with a late start of OKC exercises between 0° and 90° (12th week postoperatively).

A total of 48 patients with unilateral complete isolated ACL tears were recruited. Single-bundle hamstring ACLR was performed in all patients. After surgery, they were randomly assigned to either the reference or treatment group. Reference group patients received conventional ACL rehabilitation, while treatment group patients received 8 weeks of WBVT in addition to conventional rehabilitation, starting from 1 month postoperatively. Joint position sense, postural control, and knee isokinetic performance were assessed before surgery and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively using the Biodex dynamometer, Biodex Stability System, and Cybex NORM, respectively. Knee range of motion (ROM), stability (manual testing and KT-1000 arthrometer), and functional ability (single-legged hop test, triple hop test, shuttle run test, and carioca test) were also examined. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. There was no complication throughout the rehabilitation. All patients achieved full knee ROM and stable knee joints at 6 months after surgery. The WBVT group demonstrated significantly better postural control, muscle performance, single-legged hop, and shuttle run (P < .05) than the reference group, but there was no significant difference in knee joint position sense, triple hop, carioca, ROM, and stability (P > .05).

However, there are no clinical trials that evaluated outcomes of OKC exercises in a restricted ROM for pain, function, muscle strength, and anterior knee laxity at 1 year after surgery.PURPOSE: To determine if an early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strength in a restricted ROM would promote a clinical improvement without causing increased anterior knee laxity in patients after ACL reconstruction.STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1.METHODS: A total of 49 patients between 16 and 50 years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus and gracilis autografts were randomly assigned to an early start OKC (EOKC) exercise group or a late start OKC (LOKC) exercise group. The EOKC group (n = 25; mean age, 26 years) received a rehabilitation protocol with an early start of OKC (fourth week postoperatively) within a restricted ROM between 45° and 90°. The LOKC group (n = 24; mean age, 24 years) performed the same protocol with a late start of OKC exercises between 0° and 90° (12th week postoperatively). Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Lysholm knee scoring scale, single-legged and crossover hop tests, and anterior knee laxity were measured to assess outcomes at the 12-week, 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month postoperative follow-up (range, 13-24 months).RESULTS: No difference (P < .05) was noted between groups with respect to demographic data. Both groups (EOKC and LOKC) had a higher level of function and less pain at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month assessments when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P < .05). The EOKC group had improved quadriceps muscle strength at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month follow-up when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P < .05); the LOKC group showed improvement only at the 17-month postoperative assessment. However, the analysis between groups showed no difference for all pain and functional assessments, including anterior knee laxity (P > .05).CONCLUSION: An early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strengthening in a restricted ROM did not differ from a late start in terms of anterior knee laxity. The EOKC group reached the same findings in relation to pain decrease and functional improvement when compared with the LOKC group but showed a faster recovery in quadriceps strength. The nonweightbearing exercises seem appropriate for patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction, when utilized in a specific ROM. The magnitude of difference in quadriceps strength between the 2 rehabilitation protocols was around 5%; however, this difference was not clinically significant, especially because both groups had equal function on the hop tests.",,,,English,English,,23423316,L609092012,10.1177/0363546513476482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546513476482,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L609092012&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546513476482&atitle=Open+kinetic+chain+exercises+in+a+restricted+range+of+motion+after+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+a+randomized+controlled+clinical+trial&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=41&issue=4&spage=788&epage=794&aulast=Fukuda&aufirst=Thiago+Y.ukio&auinit=T.Y.&aufull=Fukuda+T.Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=788-794&date=2013&auinit1=T&auinitm=Y,Copyright 2016 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Methods: Sixty-nine patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction using hamstring autografts were randomly allocated to either the press-fit technique group (group A) or conventional technique group (group B). All patients were evaluated for TVE and tunnel widening using computed tomography scanning, for functional outcome using International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores, for rotational stability using the pivot-shift test, and for anterior laxity using the KT-2000 arthrometer at a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Results: There were no significant differences in TVE between the 2 groups. In group A, in which the press-fit technique was used, mean volume enlargement in the femoral tunnel was 65% compared with 71.5% in group B (P =.84). In group A, 57% (20 of 35) of patients developed femoral TVE compared with 67% (23 of 34) of patients in group B (P =.27).

Methods: Patients undergoing primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring autograft in a single unit were invited to participate in this study. Patients were randomized to receive either the Calaxo screw (Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA) or Milagro screw (DePuy Mitek, Raynham, MA) for tibial fixation. Patients were reviewed with subjective and objective evaluation by use of the International Knee Documentation Committee form, Lysholm score, KT-1000 arthrometry (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and clinical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1 year and computed tomography scanning at 1 week and at 6, 12, and 24 months. Results: Sixty patients agreed to participate in the study, with 32 patients randomized to the Calaxo screw and 28 to the Milagro screw for tibial fixation. There was no significant difference in subjective or objective clinical outcome between the 2 groups. At 24 months, 88% of Calaxo screws showed complete screw resorption compared with 0% of Milagro screws (P <.001). Tibial cysts were present in 88% of the Calaxo group and 7% of the Milagro group (P =.001). At 24 months, the mean volume of new bone formation for the Calaxo group was 21% of original screw volume. Ossification of the Milagro screw was unable to be accurately assessed as a result of incomplete screw resorption. Conclusions: Both screws showed similar favorable objective and subjective outcomes at 2 years. The Calaxo screw resorbed completely over a period of 6 months and was associated with a high incidence of intra-tunnel cyst formation. The Milagro screw increased in volume over a period of 6 months, followed by a gradual resorption, which was still ongoing at 2 years. Both screws were associated with tunnel widening, and neither showed evidence of significant tunnel ossification. We conclude that, despite satisfactory clinical outcomes, the addition of ""osteoconductive"" materials to bioabsorbable screws is not associated with bone formation at the screw site at 2 years.

Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction using a hamstring graft were randomly allocated either to have PRP introduced into the tunnels peri-operatively or not. CT scanning of the knees was carried out on the day after surgery and at three months post-operatively and the width of the tunnels was measured. Patients were also evaluated clinically at three months, when laxity was also measured. Each group comprised 25 patients, and at three months post-operatively all were pain-free with stable knees, a negative Lachman test and a good range of movement. Arthrometric results had improved significantly in both groups (p < 0.001).

A total of 100 participants between 16 and 50 years of age with a complete ACL tear were randomly assigned to undergo ACLR using either the ipsilateral or contralateral leg as the STG graft donor. Primary outcome measures were the ACL Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QOL), concentric knee flexion and extension strength at 60 and 240 deg/s, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, early postoperative pain and diary of analgesic use, and rate of reruptures. Outcome measures were evaluated before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The ACL-QOL score improved over time for both groups (P < .001), and there were no significant differences between groups at any time point (P = .528). Significant differences in knee flexion and extension strength were found at 3 months after surgery. There were no differences between groups in IKDC knee assessment scores or rerupture rates. There does not appear to be any measurable benefit or drawback in quality of life to the use of an STG graft from the unaffected limb. In light of this finding, further research to examine other possible effects on agility and balance as well as time and ability to return to sport should be conducted. Longer term follow-up beyond 2 years would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the risk of reruptures or contralateral reruptures using this novel approach.",,,,English,,,24001575,L563069668,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L563069668&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:&atitle=Ipsilateral+versus+contralateral+hamstring+grafts+in+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+a+prospective+randomized+trial.&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=41&issue=11&spage=2492&epage=2499&aulast=McRae&aufirst=Sheila&auinit=S.&aufull=McRae+S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=2492-2499&date=2013&auinit1=S&auinitm=,Copyright 2015 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Box 211, Amsterdam, Netherlands.","Introduction: This study aimed to compare the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) of three different ACL reconstruction (ACLR) techniques and its association with early clinical and functional outcomes. Methods: Sixty-two male adult patients undergoing primary ACLR were prospectively parallel randomized to bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BPTB), single-bundle (HT-SB) or double-bundle (HT-DB) hamstring graft. BMD (primary outcome) at the proximal tibia, distal femur, femoral neck and trochanteric region was measured blindly at day 1, 3. months, 5. months and 1. year after surgery. KT-1000, Lysholm, IKDC, one-leg hop test and Lachman test were performed blindly at baseline and 1. year post-reconstruction. Results: There was a significant bone loss at the injured knee and hip at 3 and 5. months which was reversible at the knee, but not at the hip, at 1. year post-operation. There was a significant improvement of early clinical and functional outcomes at 1. year. No significant differences in bone loss was detected among different surgical techniques, except BMD loss at the femoral neck, though a trend of greater BMD loss in the HT-SB group at 5. months after reconstruction was observed. There was a significant positive correlation between BMD at the distal femur and the single-leg hop distance at 1. year. Conclusion: In conclusion, the three surgical techniques were similar in transient bone loss at the knee region, irreversible bone loss at the hip, early clinical and functional outcomes up to 1. year post-reconstruction. BMD at the distal femur was positively associated with the single-leg hop distance at 1. year post-reconstruction. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,,ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00418964),English,English,2012640306,22425308,L51912914,10.1016/j.knee.2012.02.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2012.02.005,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L51912914&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09680160&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.knee.2012.02.005&atitle=A+randomized+controlled+trial+comparing+bone+mineral+density+changes+of+three+different+ACL+reconstruction+techniques&stitle=Knee&title=Knee&volume=19&issue=6&spage=779&epage=785&aulast=Lui&aufirst=Pauline+Po+Yee&auinit=P.P.Y.&aufull=Lui+P.P.Y.&coden=KNEEF&isbn=&pages=779-785&date=2012&auinit1=P&auinitm=P.Y.,"Copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Tibial Tunnel Widening in ACL Reconstruction-Comparing Two Bioscrews: A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial,,,,,,5/8/2025,5/8/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2012). Date of Publication: 7 Nov 2012,clinicaltrials.gov,2012,,,,,7-Nov-12,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryWidening of the single tibial tunnel following ACL surgery with quadrupled hamstrings autograft may contribute to failure of the graft and/or present technical challenges secondary to bone loss in a revision setting (Getelman, 1999). As such, efforts should be made to minimize the incidence and magnitude of tibial tunnel widening without sacrificing the biomechanical properties of the graft construct. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the tibial tunnel widening relationship between bioabsorbable interference screws composed of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) alone and composite bioabsorbable interference screws composed of poly-L-lactic acid embedded with beta tricalcium phosphate (PLLA+TCP) utilized as tibial fixation devices. Specifically the study has the following objectives: 1) To quantify the extent of tibial tunnel enlargement at 3-, 6- and 12-months post ACL reconstruction with autogenous quadrupled hamstring graft; 2) To determine if the incorporation of beta tricalcium phosphate to the bioabsorbable interference screw alters the observed magnitude of tunnel widening; 3) To hypothesize mechanisms for any observed differences between tibial fixation devices; and 4) To correlate tibial tunnel widening with clinical outcome status. It is hypothesized that the PLLA+TCP bioabsorbable interference screw will not be associated with a reduction in tibial tunnel widening around the implant but rather between the implant and articular surface, compared to the PLLA alone screw. It is also hypothesized that there will be no effect of observed tunnel widening on clinical outcomes or graft failure rates.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT01727739,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01727739,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT01727739&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft would have a better clinical outcome and reduce the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement compared with a conventional method because of the enhanced anchoring between the tendon graft and the bone. Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Patients (N = 64) with unilateral ACL rupture underwent arthroscopically assisted single-bundle ACL reconstruction using a 4-strand semitendinosus tendon or 4-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendons with EndoButton femoral fixation and screw washer tibial fixation. These patients were equally randomized to undergo the CaP (n = 32) or conventional (n = 32) method using a transtibial tunnel approach according to the closed envelope method. In the CaP group, the tendon graft was hybridized with the CaP at both ends of the graft. One surgeon performed all reconstructions without knowing which graft was prepared. Patients' backgrounds regarding age at surgery, gender, period before surgery, and associated meniscal injuries were similar in the 2 groups. All patients followed the same postoperative protocol. At 1 and 2 years after surgery, they were evaluated with the manual knee laxity test, KT-1000 arthrometry, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) examination form, Tegner scale, and Lysholm scale. Also, 1 year postoperatively, bone tunnel enlargement was analyzed using computed tomography, intensity of the tendon graft by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tendon graft appearance by arthroscopic examination. All the examinations were performed blindly. All patients underwent a minimum 2-year follow-up. KT-1000 arthrometry data indicated statistically significant decreased average anterior tibial translation in the CaP group compared with the conventional method group: 1.0 ± 2.0 mm versus 1.9 ± 1.6 mm (P < .05), respectively, at 1 year; 1.6 ± 2.1 mm versus 2.6 ± 2.4 mm (P < .05), respectively, at 2 years. The Lysholm score was higher in the CaP group than in the conventional method group at 2 years (96.9 ± 4.3 vs 91.7 ± 13.3, P < .05). The CaP-hybridized tendon graft reduced the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement of the anteroposterior diameter at the main joint aperture site 1 year postoperatively (femoral side: 15.5% ± 13.4% vs 22.1% ± 16.4%, P < .05; tibial side: 19.3% ± 17.1% vs 26.1% ± 13.7%, P < .05). The results of the pivot-shift test, IKDC grade, and Tegner score; the intensity of the tendon graft (MRI); and arthroscopic appearance were not significantly different at both follow-up periods in the 2 groups. The CaP-hybridized tendon graft improved anterior knee stability and Lysholm scores at the 2-year follow-up and improved anterior knee stability and reduced the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement in both tunnels at the 1-year follow-up compared with the conventional method for single-bundle ACL reconstruction.

Ninety patients were randomized: double-bundle ACL reconstruction with bioabsorbable screw fixation (DB group; n = 30), single-bundle ACL reconstruction with bioabsorbable screw fixation (SBB group; n = 30), and single-bundle ACL reconstruction with metallic screw fixation (SBM group; n = 30).

A Prospective and Consecutive Clinical Evaluation of Soft Tissue Regeneration's L-C Ligament® in Primary ACL Reconstruction,,,,,,5/27/2025,5/27/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2012). Date of Publication: 22 Jun 2012,clinicaltrials.gov,2012,,,,,22-Jun-12,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a resorbable polymer implant (Soft Tissue Regeneration's L-C Ligament) for replacement and regeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Approximately 15 patients at 2-3 different hospitals in Europe will participate in this study. The hypothesis of this study is that the L-C Ligament will successfully regenerate the ACL with clinical outcomes similar to or better than surgical intervention with auto graft tissue.Detailed DescriptionReconstruction of the ACL is currently recommended as the standard of care following an ACL tear or rupture. The ACL has poor healing potential and repair of the damaged tissue is rarely successful. The gold standard for reconstruction of the ACL is autograft tissue, with the patellar and hamstring tendons the most common. The limitations of autograft are donor site morbidity and pain, and potential damage of the remaining tissue at the harvest site. Other problems include a limited amount of tendon available for harvesting, unpredictable resorption characteristics, and increased recovery time. Allografts are tissues such as patellar, hamstring, and Achilles tendons obtained from cadavers. The advantages of surgery with allograft are less pain and scarring, decreased surgical time, and faster rehabilitation. However, allografts can transmit disease, may elicit an unfavorable immunogenic response, and incorporate slower than autograft. Also, allografts cannot be sterilized without damaging the tissue, leading to a choice between a risk of bacterial infection and decreased tensile strength and healing potential. The proposed study is a prospective, consecutive, non-randomized, multicentre clinical trial conducted at up to five European sites, wherein 15 study subjects will undergo primary ACL reconstruction with the L-C Ligament. After screening procedures are completed, eligible study subjects who provide written informed consent will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will undergo preoperative clinical, MRI, and radiographic evaluations and undergo primary ACL reconstruction. Follow-up clinical evaluations will be performed post-op (range 1-8 weeks), 3 months (± 3 weeks), 6 months (± 3 weeks), 12 months (± 1 month), and 24 months (± 2 months) after surgery. Assessment of safety (i.e., assessment of adverse events and complications), pain, and clinical function as well as imaging will occur. In accordance with a separate radiographic protocol, analysis and scoring of MRI images (pre-op, 1 and 2 years), radiographs (pre- and post- op), and a CT scan post-op and at 1-year will be undertaken by an independent radiologist who will be masked to the identities of the subjects and clinical investigators. Outcome measures for imaging include position of the bone tunnels and interference screws, indirect evidence of ligament tissue remodeling, and evidence of tunnel-widening. Evidence of OA will also be monitored. The Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators will ensure that complications observed on radiographs, MRI, and CT images are reported to their ethics committee and the sponsor. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the L-C Ligament in primary ACL reconstruction. Safety will be evaluated by the occurrence, frequency, and severity of intra- and post- operative complications; the primary end point is one year and follow-up wil be performed for a minimum of two years. Clinical function will be assessed with the IKDC-2000 Scale and functionality of the device at two years follow-up. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine efficacy by objectively and subjectively measuring pain, function, and the results of image analyses of the L-C Ligament in primary ACL reconstruction. Objective measures include the Lachman test, the anterior drawer test, the KT-1000 Arthrometer, the pivot-shift test, and the single-leg hop test. Pre- and post- operative objective and subjective measures include the Tegner and Lysholm scales.

Methods: Forty-two patients randomly underwent single-bundle (Group SB, n = 21) or double-bundle (Group DB, n = 21) ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendon autografts. Anterior tibial translation and rotatory laxity were measured prior to and after fixation of the graft during reconstruction under the guidance of a navigation system. Clinical outcome measurements included the evaluation of the joint stability and functional status. Results: Anterior tibial translation and rotatory laxity were improved significantly at all degrees of knee flexion in both groups. The postoperative total rotation (sum of internal and external rotation) at 30° and 60° (26.6° vs. 24.0°; 28.7° vs. 25.1°) as well as postoperative change in external rotation at 60° (-1.4° vs. -4.6°), and a change in total rotation at 30° and 60° (-7.0° vs. -11.5°; -6.1° vs. -8.9°) differed between the two groups, with better stability in the DB group. At 2 years follow-up, IKDC subjective satisfaction score was significantly different between two groups (70.9 vs. 79.6), while manual and instrumented laxity, pivot shift tests, modified Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, thigh muscle strengths were not different. Correlation analysis showed little correlations between anterior laxity tests at follow-up, and the kinematic variables measured by navigation during surgery while pivot shift test, IKDC subjective satisfaction score, modified Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score were mainly correlated with navigation-measured rotations in both groups. Conclusions: The kinematic tests in this study found evidence suggesting that the DB ACL reconstruction improved rotatory laxity better than the SB ACL reconstruction at 30° and 60° of flexion, but there was no difference in functional outcome at 2 years follow-up between SB and DB groups.

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. From December 2005 to December 2007, 320 patients were prospectively randomized into 3 groups: ADB, ASB, and CSB reconstruction. The average follow-up was 51.15 months (range, 39-63 months). At the final follow-up, 281 patients were available.

Methods: We randomly separated 55 patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture into 3 groups: 18 in DB group, 18 in AM group, and 19 in PL group. The mean follow-up period is 33.7 months for the DB group, 31.9 months for the AM group, and 33.2 months for the PL group. We evaluated the Lysholm score, Tegner score, anterior laxity with the KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), rotator instability with the pivot-shift test, and muscle strength with knee extensor and flexor isokinetic peak torques at 60°/s. Results: There were no significant differences in postoperative Lysholm score and Tegner score. Anterior stability of the knee, as measured by the KT-1000 arthrometer, was significantly better in the DB group than the PL group (P < .05). The negative rate of the manual pivot-shift test in the DB group was significantly superior to the PL group (P < .05). Muscle strength of the extensor in the DB group was significantly superior to that in the AM group (P < .05), and muscle strength of the flexor in the PL group was significantly inferior to that in both the DB and AM groups (P < .05). Two patients in the PL group had rerupture; however, there was no graft failure in the other groups. Conclusions: At 2 years' follow-up, patients undergoing DB anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction had greater extension strength than patients receiving an AM single-bundle reconstruction. The DB and AM groups had greater flexion strength than the PL group. The DB and AM groups had a similar rate of negative pivot-shift test results, whereas the PL group had fewer negative pivot-shift test results than the DB group. There were no KT-1000 side-to-side differences between the DB and AM groups, whereas the DB group had better results than the PL group. Overall, the clinical outcome as measured by Lysholm and Tegner scores was not different between groups.

"Proprioceptive Function, Postural Stability & Clinical Outcome After Stump Preserving Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Surgery - A Comparative Study",,,,,,5/7/2025,5/7/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2011). Date of Publication: 4 May 2011,clinicaltrials.gov,2011,,,,,4-May-11,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is known to serve a number of functions in the knee joint. Besides providing mechanical stability, it also contributes to proprioceptive function. Numerous studies reported ACL is rich in mechanoreceptors contribute in proprioceptive function. ACL augmentation, or selective ACL bundle (AM, anteromedial or PL, posterolateral) reconstruction, a relatively new technique for partial torn ACL, preserves and augments the ACL remnant aiming at maintaining or facilitating proprioception, is now gaining its popularity. Preserving ACL stump is also reported to have merits in providing better mechanical protection and promoting revascularization to the newly reconstructed graft. In local setting, stump preserving ACL surgery is the usual practice in handling partial ACL tear. With the background of the surgery's potential benefits in restoration of knee function, a single-blinded, comparative study on the difference in proprioception, postural stability and clinical outcome between stump preserving ACL surgery and reconstruction is conducted.Detailed DescriptionAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is well known to be the knee's primary stabilizer which would be compromised by ligamentous injury, causing various functional deficits. Currently, ACL reconstruction is the common management focus on restoration of stability. Beside joint stabilization, proprioception, defined as the system of joint position sense and movement, is another function of the ACL which has also been widely studied. The proprioceptive function of human ACL has been recognized since the 1980's. The first study by described the presence of mechanoreceptors in human ACL fibres. Study further proved that ACL is extensively innervated with neural elements. Numerous studies reported ACL is rich in mechanoreceptors which contribute in proprioceptive function. One study on 29 ACL remnant reported that there are mechanoreceptors including Ruffini, Pacini receptors, Golgi tendon organ-like receptors and free nerves endings in the remnant and showed the numbers of mechanoreceptors is significantly related to joint sense accuracy. Another study performed by same group of researchers reported that a somatosensory evoked potential could be recorded in ACL remnants after electrical stimulation, confirmed original sensory neurons are preserved to certain extent, which may help graft neuralization and restoration of knee function. This further echos with various studies that, in ACL-deficit knee, loss of proprioceptive function is reported with corelation to the number of mechanoreceptors. At a result, it comes up with an idea that preserving the ACL remnant should help maintaining or facilitating proprioceptive function, by the operation technique of ACL augmentation. ACL augmentation is a relatively new technique which preserves and augments the ACL remnant using extra graft. Under arthroscopic examination, if any of the ACL bundles, anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL), shows a partial tear remnant of reasonable size, thickness and tension, augmentation may be performed instead of reconstruct the whole ligament. Instead of removing the remaining stump, it would be preserved as much as possible, and a formal ACL reconstruction would be performed. A commonly used graft is single-bundle autogenous semitendinosus gracilis tendon. As the retaining ACL fiber contains mechanoreceptor responsible for proprioception, it is believed that better knee proprioception and postural sense could be achieved by preserving the ACL remnant. Also, better vascularization and stronger mechanical protection is expected as native ACL fiber is retained. The current management of partial tear ACL injury are mainly conservative treatment and surgical treatment, including reconstruction and augmentation. For augmentation, the common practise is to perform a ""Selective Bundle Reconstruction"", that is to reconstruct the torn bundle, either AM or PL reconstruction, and preserve the remaining intact one. The clinical benefits of ACL augmentation had been reported by several studies. A study had demonstrated good clinical results in International Knee Documentation Commitee (IKDC) knee evaluation score, Cincinnati Knee Score and KT1000 in augmentation using autologous doubled and tripled semitendinosus (selective AM or PL) reconstruction at 1 year post-operatively. An other comparison study between ACL augmentation (selective AM or PL reconstruction) and reconstruction showed superior result in knee anterior stability in clinical tests, KT2000 and knee joint position sense in augmentation group at a 2-year follow-up period. This study has demonstrated the post-operation comparison only and allogenic fascia lata graft was also used in the control reconstruction group, which is not a common graft to be used in ACL surgery in local setting. Moreover, as the assessment is performed at 2 years post-operatively, the more immediate and early post-operative effect of this surgical technique is still questionable. As mentioned above, ACL augmentation may has potential clinical advantages including better knee stability, mechanical strength and proprioceptive function, yet evidence of the earlier effect of this technique is still lacking, with joint position sense was demonstrated by one study only. With the relatively new technique's popularity and potential benefit on proprioception, it deserves more research on studying the difference in both the clinical and proprioception outcome from reconstruction. Therefore, a comparative study on the difference in knee proprioception and postural stability between ACL augmentation and reconstruction, including early post-operative assessment is performed. In local setting, if the ACL injury is noted to be partially torn from pre-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), surgeons would try to preserve the remaining stump as much as possible with a single bundle ACL reconstruction performed intra-operatively. In order to make the current study result meaningful and could be generalized in local setting, ACL augmentation is renamed as ACL stump-preserving surgery, which is the common practice in local setting.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT01348945,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01348945,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT01348945&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Methods: Sixty-two ACL-insufficient patients were included in a prospective, randomized study (31 BPT and 31 HT). Both surgical procedures were performed without any implants by a press-fit technique by the senior author. The femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal for anatomic placement. At 8.8 years after reconstruction, 53 patients (28 BPT and 25 HT) were examined by different clinical and functional tests. Bilateral MRI scans were performed and interpreted by an independent radiologist. Results: On follow-up, the score on the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form was significantly better in the HT group. The clinical examination including range of motion, KT-1000 test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and pivot-shift test showed no significant differences. On isokinetic testing, the mean quadriceps strength was close to normal (96%) in both groups, but the hamstring strength was lower in the HT group (100.3%/95.1%). Kneeling (1.5/1.1, P = .002), knee walking (1.72/1.14, P = .002), and single-leg hop test (95.8%/99.1%, P = .057) were better in the HT group. The MRI findings about the mean degree of cartilage lesion (International Cartilage Repair Society protocol) of the operated (2.1/2.1) and nonoperated (1.4/1.8) knee showed no significant differences. No significant difference was found in the grade of medial or lateral meniscal lesion or the number of patients having meniscal lesions when the operated and nonoperated knees were compared. Tunnel measurements, Caton-Deschamps Index, and the sagittal ACL angle were similar. Conclusions: The implant-free press-fit technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by use of bonepatellar tendon and hamstring grafts with anatomic graft placement is an innovative technique to preserve the cartilage and meniscal status without significant differences between the operated and nonoperated knees in the long term. Significantly less anterior knee pain was noted in the hamstring group, when testing for kneeling and knee walking.

Methods: We included 34 patients in the study and randomized them into 2 groups--EndoButton and Transfix groups. An anteromedial portal technique was used to create the femoral tunnels in the EndoButton group, whereas a transtibial technique was used in the Transfix group. A bioabsorbable screw was used on the tibial side in both groups. Thirty patients completed the study protocol, and assessment was done at regular intervals until 12 months of follow-up was reached. The patients underwent computed tomography scans at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. The diameters of the tunnels were measured perpendicular to the long axis of the tunnels on oblique coronal and oblique sagittal planes at 3 levels: aperture, midway, and suspension point. We performed functional scoring with the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjective Knee Evaluation score and Lysholm score. Results: Femoral tunnel widening at the aperture and at midway was significantly greater in the EndoButton group compared with the Transfix group. A decrease in the loop length in the EndoButton group was associated with lesser tunnel widening, although this was not found to be statistically significant with the numbers available. A trend toward decreased tunnel widening at the aperture on the tibial side was observed when the tip of the screw was 10 to 15 mm away from the aperture.

Recently, reconstructions with double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (DLSG) grafts have become common. The prevailing opinion is that ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft produces a more stable knee with more anterior knee pain than DLSG grafts, while the functional results and knee scores are similar. The present study evaluates BPTB grafts fixed with metallic interference screws and DLSG grafts fixed with Bone Mulch Screw on the femur and WasherLoc fixation on the tibia. All else being the same, there is no difference in the outcome between the two grafts and fixation methods. This is a prospective randomized multicenter study. A total of 115 patients Screws and WasherLoc Screws. Follow-up was at one and two years; the latter by an independent observer. At two years, one ACL revision had been performed in each group. Eight patients in the DLSG group and one in the BPTB group underwent meniscus surgery in the follow-up period (P = 0.014). Mean Lysholm score at the two year follow-up was 91 (SD ± 10.3) in the DLSG group and also 91 (SD ± 10.2) in the BPTB group. Mean KT-1000 at two years was 1.5 mm in the BPTB group and 1.8 mm in the DLSG group (n.s.). At two years, four patients in the BPTB group and three in the DLSG group had a Lachman test grade 2 or 3 (n.s.). More patients in the BPTB group had pain at the lower pole of the patella (P = 0.04). Peak flexion torque and total flexion work were lower in the DLSG group at one year (P = 0.003 and P = 0.000) and total flexion work also at two years (P = 0.05). BPTB ACL reconstruction fixed with interference screws and DLSG fixed with Bone Mulch Screws on the femur and WasherLoc Screws on the tibia produce satisfactory and nearly identical outcomes. Among our patients in the DLSG group, flexion strength was lower, and more patients underwent meniscus surgery in the follow-up period.

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. A randomized series of 77 patients, all with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture, were divided into 2 groups (PLLA and metal). In both groups, hamstring tendon autografts were used with interference screw fixation at both ends and the patients were examined with standard radiographs, Tegner activity level, Lysholm knee score, single-legged hop test, early C-reactive protein response, and KT-1000 arthrometer knee laxity measurements. The preoperative assessments in both groups were similar in terms of gender, clinical tests, and the time from injury to surgery. The patients returned for a radiographic and clinical examination a mean of 96 months (range, 78-120 months) after the index operation. The PLLA group displayed significantly larger bone tunnels on the radiographs than the metal group on the femoral side (mean, 11.4 mm [range, 0-17.8 mm] vs 8.0 mm [range, 0-16.3 mm]; P < .005) but not on the tibial side (mean, 10.7 mm [range, 7.8-14.1 mm] vs 10.5 mm [range, 0-20.3 mm]; difference not significant).

Effects of Hamstring Training in Different Modes on Stabilizing Knee Joints With Anterior Drawer Laxity,,,,,,5/28/2025,5/28/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2010). Date of Publication: 23 Jul 2010,clinicaltrials.gov,2010,,,,,23-Jul-10,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryQuestion: To investigate how different modes of thigh muscles strengthening exercises emphasizing the knee internal rotators can be as effective as possible in improving the static stability and agility of the knees with anterior drawer laxity. Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants and Interventions: Young men with anterior drawer laxity of the knee were randomly assigned to three experimental groups in different strengthening modes: plate-loaded squat press (SP), plate-loaded kneeling leg curl with internal rotation (KLCIR), and kneeling leg curl (KLC). The control group with stable knees received no training. Outcome measures: static and dynamic knee stability, isokinetic strength. The purpose of this paper was to find out an optimal solution to the enhancement of the static and dynamic knee stability to a great extent. Key words: anterior cruciate ligament; agility; knee stability; hamstring; knee internal rotatorDetailed DescriptionINTRODUCTION Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are commonly seen among athletes, which eventually makes more or less devastating impacts on their performances. Although ACL injuries may result from the knee collision, 70% of them are due to noncontact movements, including abrupt brakes, changing directions at high speed (i.e. sidestep cuttings and crossover cuttings). In doing so, one must at first have his or her axial foot fixed on the ground to absorb the momentum oriented from the original direction. Insufficient eccentric muscles or ligament strength are likely to trigger muscle and ligament injuries. It is generally agreed that the risk of ligament injuries can be reduced by strengthening a specific muscle group by which the dynamic stability of the joint is able to be enhanced and the static stability provided by the ligament can also be compensated. Traditionally, the strengthening exercise of ACL rehabilitation has been putting an emphasis on the hamstring and quadriceps with an attempt to decrease the anterior drawer instability as well as the shearing force of ACL. Nonetheless, from the aforementioned pathomechanism of ACL injuries, the knee rotators should be valued as they are supposed to . The internal rotators of the knee joint (semitendinosus, semimembranosus and gracilis) are highly related to ACL injuries5. However, the knee rotator strength is often neglected and even sacrificed as an autograft for the ACL reconstruction . Modifications can be made in progressive resistance exercise for strengthening knee internal rotators. In this current study, 20 subjects with anterior drawer laxity were randomly assigned to three groups adopting different training modes: plate-loaded squat press (SP), plate-loaded kneeling leg curl with internal rotation (KLCIR), and plate-loaded kneeling leg curl (KLC). Static stability, dynamic stability, and isokinetic strength were measured. The purpose of this paper was to find out an optimal solution to the enhancement of the static and dynamic knee stability to a great extent. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects The research program was approved by the Human Subject Committee in Taipei Physical Education College. Knee joint laxity was surveyed by a KT-2000 test (MED Metric Co., San Diego, USA) in the Department of Physical Education and Health at Taipei Physical Education College. The anterior drawer laxity of the knee joint in this study was defined as anterior displacement over 3 mm discrepancy between bilateral knee joints by a KT-2000 test under 20-pound force. According to this criterion, Dale M. et al. demonstrated that 85% (33/39) of this population have complete ACL tears and 15% (6/39) have partial tear. One hundred and seventy-three students were tested and 30 met the criterion, including 22 males and 8 females, although no obvious trauma history was available in some of them. Two males were excluded due to other causes that might affect muscle strength or knee stability such as lower limbs fracture and arthritis. Besides, eight female students were eliminated to avoid possible gender difference. Twenty male students were included in the experimental group. Another 8 male students with stable knees without any medical history of knee injuries were included in the control group. The participants in both experimental and control groups lived a sedentary lifestyle. Stable knees were defined as a discrepancy less than 1.5mm between bilateral knees by a KT-2000 test under 20-pound force. Flow Path Twenty subjects in the experimental group were randomly assigned into three groups: SP (n=7), KLCIR (n=7) and KLC (n=6). Eight control subjects neither received any training nor was engaged in body-building on their own during the training period. Every subject was asked to fill in basic information, including age, body height, and body weight. Before the experiments, the flow path was explained to each subject who had already signed an informed-consent form. The experimental procedure was divided into three phases. The first and the third phases were the tests before and after training respectively, including KT-2000, agility, and isokinetic strength assessment. The second phase was the training phase. Static Stability (Laxity) The KT-2000 knee ligament arthrometer (MED Metric Co., San Diego, USA) is designed to assess the anterior drawer laxity of the knee joint. The discrepancy of anterior displacement between the sound side and the lesion side had been reported and applied in evaluating the static stability of the knee, and it was also used as one of the references for the ACL reconstruction surgery. In this current study, a discrepancy less than 1.5mm was normally accepted when 20-pound anterior traction force was exerted on the tibia with the knee joint in 20° flexion. In contrast, ACL laxity was defined as a discrepancy over 3mm, which was highly related to ACL injury. Dynamic Stability (Agility) Dynamic knee stability was assessed by agility, which was measured by a 6-meter left-and-right shuttle run. A good dynamic knee stability is necessary for changing the movement direction. Each subject started running from the midline to the left terminal and then stepped on the square with his left foot. Then, the subject used the left leg as the axis and turned around to the right side. The subject then ran to the right terminal. Once the front foot was crossing the midline, this was the first round for testing the agility of left knee. The subject kept running to the right terminal without stopping on the midline, stepping on the square with his right foot, turning around to the left side, and running toward the left terminal. This was the first round of right knee test as the subject's front foot crossed the midline. Whenever the front foot crossed the midline, a timer was clocked. The time interval in seconds between the 1st and the 2nd time clocked was the 1st measure of the left knee agility, and the time interval between the 2nd and the 3rd was the 1st measure of the right knee agility, and so forth. There were five-round tests for the agility of right and left knees respectively. Three raters were assigned respectively at the midline, right and left terminals. Single-blind method was adopted. That is, all the three raters did not know which group the subject was assigned to. The square at the right or left terminal ends was 10 inches wide and 3 meters away from the midline. It would be recognized as a qualified round if the plantar surface of the foot ever contacted any part of the square; otherwise, the subject would be asked to repeat the whole set consisting of five rounds. Three sets were collected and averaged. The rest interval between each set should be long enough for the examinee to feel relaxed before the next set. The subject was asked to run as fast as possible. The average time difference of 3 sets between the affected and the sound side was regarded as the dynamic stability of the affected side. The greater the difference was, the poorer the dynamic stability or the agility would be. A practice session was given prior to the actual beginning of the study to avoid learning effect. Prior to the study, intrarater test-retest reliability was established. Nine subjects, including four in the experimental groups and five in the control group, took the agility exam twice in separated days. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.78. Isokinetic Strength Cybex NORM (Cybex International, Inc, Ronkonkoma, New York, U.S.A.) was employed to evaluate isokinetic muscle strength before and after training. Tests were conducted in two different motion modes which included the flexor/extensor and the internal /external rotator. In the former, the range of motion was set in the range of 0-90°. Maximal concentric force had been performed for five times at the angular velocity of 60°, 120° and 180° per second, respectively. Peak torque was taken to represent muscle strength. Only smooth and similar curves with a peak torque which was no less than 90% of the maximum would be taken. The assessment of isokinetic strength of internal/external rotator was generally similar to flexor/extensor. The ankle joint was fixed into 30° dorsiflexion with an air-stirrup ankle brace (Aircast, Summit, NJ) to limit unnecessary inversion/eversion movement, which might affect measurement of knee joint rotation. In addition, the knee and hip joints were kept in 90°, and the range of motion of knee rotation was set in the range between 25° internally and 35° externally. Training Modes Three training modes were chosen. (Ⅰ) SP (or called angled leg presses); (Ⅱ) KLCIR; (Ⅲ) KLC. The training phase had been lasting for 6 weeks in which none dropped out. Each subject had to accomplish three training workouts weekly under supervision by licensed athletic trainers. A workout contained five sets for each lower limb, which were composed of 20 (repetitions)×60% (1RM), 15×65% , 12×70% , 8×75% and 20×60% with a two-minute resting interval between each set. During the six-week rehabilitation course, they were not allowed to involve in any other regular fitness activities or sports. Data Analysis Data are expressed as mean±SEM. SPSS version 12.0 Windows was used for statistic analysis. Nonparametric analysis, including Kruskal-Wallis Test, Wilcoxon Test and Mann-Whitney test, was applied. Significance was defined as P\<0.05.

Box 89, Vienna, Austria.","Background: Arthroscopic reconstruction is a standard surgical procedure in cases of symptomatic knee instability due to rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. Bone-tendon-bone and hamstring tendon grafts are both in use for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. There are no signifi cant diff erences between the two types of graft in relation to function scores, but there is a diff erence in anteroposterior stability when measured on the KT- 2000 arthrometer: knee joints after reconstruction with bone-tendon-bone autografts are more stable than those reconstructed with hamstring tendon autografts. Purpose: To improve knee stability after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a hamstring graft and use of platelet-derived growth factors. Basic procedure: Platelet-leukocyte gel was produced from platelet-leukocyte-rich plasma prepared from a unit of whole blood in an autologous platelet separator. The gel was applied locally, after hamstring graft placement. Fifty patients were included in the study: 25 in the platelet gel group, 25 in a control group. We evaluated anteroposterior knee stability with the KT-2000 arthrometer before surgery and at 3 and 6 months aftersurgery. Main fi ndings: Patients treated with the gel demonstrated signifi cantly better anteroposterior knee stability than patients in the control group. The calculated improvements in knee stability at 6 months were 1.3± 1.8 mm in the control group and 3.1± 2.5 mm in the platelet gel group (P = 0.011). Principal conclusion: Platelet-leukocyte gel, applied locally, can improve knee stability in surgery for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","basic fibroblast growth factor (106096-93-9), epidermal growth factor (62229-50-9), thrombin (869858-13-9, 9002-04-4), vasculotropin (127464-60-2)",,,English,English,2010437696,20517680,L359340573,10.1007/s00508-010-1340-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00508-010-1340-2,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L359340573&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=00435325&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00508-010-1340-2&atitle=The+effect+of+platelet-derived+growth+factors+on+knee+stability+after+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+A+prospective+randomized+clinical+study&stitle=Wien.+Klin.+Wochenschr.&title=Wiener+Klinische+Wochenschrift&volume=122&issue=SUPPL.+2&spage=91&epage=95&aulast=Vogrin&aufirst=Matja%C5%BE&auinit=M.&aufull=Vogrin+M.&coden=WKWOA&isbn=&pages=91-95&date=2010&auinit1=M&auinitm=,"Copyright 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

We randomised 105 consecutive patients with injury associated with chondral lesions no more severe than grades 1 and 2 and/or meniscal tears which only required trimming, to early (< two weeks) or delayed (> four to six weeks) reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using a quadrupled hamstring graft. All operations were performed by a single surgeon and a standard rehabilitation regime was followed in both groups.

HYPOTHESIS: Fixation of hamstring tendon grafts with a porous bone scaffold limits bone tunnel enlargement compared with a biodegradable interference screw fixation. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods Between 2005 and 2006, 20 patients (17 men, 3 women) with a primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized to obtain graft fixation in the tibial tunnel either by means of an interference screw (I) or a press-fit fixation with a porous bone cylinder (P). At 3 months after surgery, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the knee was performed, and tunnel enlargement was analyzed in the coronal and sagittal planes for the proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the tunnel. After 6 months and 1 and 2 years, radiographs of the knee in the sagittal and coronal plane were analyzed for bone tunnel widening. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, and Lysholm scores of both groups were compared after 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: The bone tunnel enlargement determined by CT was 106.9% + or - 10.9% for group P and 121.9% + or - 9.0% for group I (P < .02) in the anteroposterior (AP) plane and 102.8% + or - 15.2% versus 121.5% + or - 10.1% in the coronal plane (P <.01). The IKDC, Tegner, and Lysholm scores improved in both groups from preoperatively to postoperatively without significant differences between the 2 groups.

HYPOTHESIS: There are no differences in the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis or knee function in patients undergoing reconstruction of a torn anterior cruciate ligament with 4-strand hamstring autograft versus patellar tendon-bone autograft. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with subacute or chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament were randomly assigned to autograft reconstruction with 4-strand gracilis and semitendinosus tendon (HAM) (N = 37) or with patellar tendon-bone (PTB) (N = 35) from the ipsilateral side. Outcome measurements were the Cincinnati knee score, single-legged hop tests, isokinetic muscle strength tests, pain, knee joint laxity test (KT-1000 arthrometer), and a radiologic evaluation (Kellgren and Lawrence) at 10-year follow-up. RESULTS: At 10 years, 57 patients (79%) were eligible for evaluation-29 in the HAM group and 28 in the PTB group. No differences were found between the 2 graft groups with respect to the Cincinnati knee score, the single-legged hop tests, pain, muscle strength measurements, or knee joint laxity. Fifty-five percent and 64% of the patients had osteoarthritis corresponding to Kellgren and Lawrence grade 2 or more in the HAM and the PTB groups, respectively (P =.27). For the uninvolved knee, the corresponding numbers were 28% and 22% (P = .62). CONCLUSION: At 10 years postoperatively, no statistically significant differences in clinical outcome between the 2 graft types were found. The prevalence of osteoarthritis was significantly higher in the operated leg than in the contralateral leg, but there were no significant differences between the 2 groups. The results indicate that the choice of graft type after an anterior cruciate ligament injury has minimal influence on the prevalence of osteoarthritis 10 years after surgery.",,,,English,,,20097928,L358986098,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L358986098&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:&atitle=No+difference+in+knee+function+or+prevalence+of+osteoarthritis+after+reconstruction+of+the+anterior+cruciate+ligament+with+4-strand+hamstring+autograft+versus+patellar+tendon-bone+autograft%3A+a+randomized+study+with+10-year+follow-up.&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=38&issue=3&spage=448&epage=454&aulast=Holm&aufirst=Inger&auinit=I.&aufull=Holm+I.&coden=&isbn=&pages=448-454&date=2010&auinit1=I&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

PURPOSE: The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of hamstring isokinetic training used in the early phase of the rehabilitation program on the stability, strength, symptoms, and functional outcomes of patients throughout 12 months after anterior cruciate ligament surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Forty-eight men underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an ipsilateral bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. The patients were randomly assigned to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 3 weeks (group I) or to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 9 weeks (group II). The patients were evaluated monthly for the first 4 months and at the 12th month for postoperative hamstring and quadriceps strength, as well as for knee function via the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale and International Knee Documentation Committee form. RESULTS: Hamstring isometric strength at 30 degrees of knee flexion (at the first and second months) and concentric isokinetic strength (at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months) at the angular velocity of 60 deg/s were significantly (P <.05-.01) greater in group I compared with group II. Average scores of the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale for symptoms were significantly (P <.05-.001) higher in group I compared with group II at all evaluation periods.

Another aim was to compare the ACL-reconstructed knee with the ACL-injured and the uninjured knees for differences in anterior tibial translation and muscle activation during the exercises. Sagittal tibial translation and muscle activation were measured during the Lachman test (static translation) and during seven rehabilitation exercises (dynamic translation) in 19 patients. Results obtained 5 weeks after ACL reconstruction were compared with those obtained before the ACL reconstruction (ACL-deficient and uninjured knee). After ACL reconstruction the seated knee extension produced more anterior tibial translation than the straight leg raise and standing on one leg. The ACL reconstruction reduced the static and the dynamic tibial translation and the tibial translations measured in ACL-reconstructed knees were similar to those measured in uninjured knees. After ACL reconstruction, the patients used a joint stiffening strategy that used more hamstring activation and reduced the dynamic tibial translation.

However, to date, only a few randomized clinical studies have been published. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the clinical results of single- and double-bundle ACL reconstruction. Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Seventy patients with a chronic unilateral ACL rupture who underwent arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction using a hamstring graft were randomized to receive a single- (SB) or double-bundle (DB) reconstruction. Both groups were comparable with regard to preoperative data. A double-incision surgical technique was adopted in both groups. The graft was fixed by looping the hamstring tendons around a bony (DB) or a metallic (SB) bridge on the tibial side and with interference screws reinforced with a staple on the femur. The same rehabilitation protocol was adopted. Outcome assessment was performed by a blinded, independent observer using the visual analog scale (VAS) score, the new International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and KT-1000 arthrometer evaluation. All the patients reached a minimum follow-up of 2 years. No differences between the 2 groups were observed in terms of KOOS and IKDC subjective score. A statistically significant difference in favor of the DB group was found with the VAS (P < .03). The objective IKDC final scores showed statistically significantly more ""normal knees"" in the DB group than in the SB group (P = .03). There was 1 stability failure in the DB group and 3 in the SB group. The KT-1000 arthrometer data showed a statistically significant decrease in the average anterior tibial translation in the DB group (1.2 mm DB vs 2.1 mm SB; P < .03). The incidence of a residual pivot-shift glide was 14% in DB and 26% in SB (P = .08).

Purpose: To compare the clinical results of biodegradable pins (RigidFix) and interference screws (BioCryl) for fixation of hamstring grafts in arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: To test the hypothesis of a difference of 1.0 ± 1.2 mm in anterior knee laxity between the two fixation options, 54 patients were randomly assigned to groups via a block randomization scheme and sealed envelopes. All patients underwent standardized hamstring graft reconstruction and had similar postoperative aftercare by an accelerated rehabilitation protocol.

Methods: Between August 2000 and May 2003, 64 Keller Army Hospital patients with complete anterior cruciate ligament tears were randomized to hamstring (n = 32) or patellar tendon (n = 32) autograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Operative graft fixation and rehabilitative techniques were the same for both groups. Follow-up assessments included the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score.

Another aim was to compare the radiographic findings in terms of degenerative changes between the study groups. A randomised series of 71 patients, who underwent ACL reconstruction using BPTB or HS tendon autografts and interference screw fixation, were included in the study. Of these patients, 47/71 (66%) attended a clinical examination, including laxity measurements using the KT-1000 arthrometer, pre-operatively and on four post-operative occasions; 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 7 years after the reconstruction. The BPTB group consisted of 22 patients, while there were 25 patients in the HS group. There were no significant differences in the mean side-to-side knee laxity between the BPTB and the HS group pre-operatively or at the follow-up examinations. There was a tendency towards a reduction in side-to-side knee laxity over time in both groups, measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer. The decrease was significant when analysing the injured and uninjured knee separately (injured side p < 0.001 (BPTB) and p = 0.005 (HS), uninjured side p = 0.008 and p = 0.042, respectively). Forty-four patients (BPTB 21, ST 23) underwent a radiographic assessment at the 7-year follow-up, which revealed no significant differences between the study groups in terms of osteoarthritic findings classified according to the Fairbank and Ahlbäck rating systems. In overall terms, osteoarthritis was identified in 16% (BPTB 19%; ST 13%; n.s.) according to the Ahlbäck rating system and 68% (BPTB 67%; ST 70%; n.s.) according to the Fairbank rating system. There were no significant differences in knee laxity measurements between the two study groups pre-operatively or at 7 years. A decrease in knee laxity over time was seen in both groups. There were no significant differences between the BPTB and ST groups in terms of osteoarthritic findings at 7 years. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,,,English,English,,19575180,L50569142,10.1007/s00167-009-0846-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-009-0846-5,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L50569142&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-009-0846-5&atitle=Knee+laxity+measurements+after+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%2C+using+either+bone-patellar-tendon-bone+or+hamstring+tendon+autografts%2C+with+special+emphasis+on+comparison+over+time&stitle=Knee+Surg.+Sports+Traumatol.+Arthroscopy&title=Knee+Surgery%2C+Sports+Traumatology%2C+Arthroscopy&volume=17&issue=9&spage=1117&epage=1124&aulast=Ahld%C3%A9n&aufirst=Mattias&auinit=M.&aufull=Ahld%C3%A9n+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1117-1124&date=2009&auinit1=M&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

The authors hypothesized that the increment of hamstring tendons strength with 6-strand graft could improve the knee stability compared to the result from using the gold standard patellar tendon. Material and Method: Thirty-four patients were prospectively randomized into two groups for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Seventeen patients underwent reconstruction with 6-strand hamstring tendons and the remaining seventeen were treated with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. Patients were followed-up under the similar rehabilitation protocol for at least 12 months. At the time of final follow-up, all the patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of patient's satisfaction, activity level, and knee stability. Results: Fifteen patients in bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (two lost to follow-up) and thirteen patients used 6-strand hamstring tendons(four were converted to 4-strand hamstring tendons) were evaluated at a mean of 19 months (range 12-31 months). The mean of KT-2000 side-to-side laxity measurement in 6-strand hamstring group (0.96 mm) is less than BPTB group (1.22 mm) significantly (p < 0.05). Eleven of 13 patients (84.62%) that received the 6-strand hamstring tendons could return to sport activities compared to 10 of 15 patients (66.67%) that received BPTB graft. Hamstring group have a lower prevalence of donor-site morbidity resulting in less difficult in kneeling.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of four-tunnel DB ACL reconstruction. Methods: Sixty-four consecutive patients with ACL ruptures from May 2005 to May 2006 were randomly assigned into two groups: 32 cases for SB ACL reconstruction and 32 cases for DB ACL reconstruction. Clinical data, including KT 2000, Biodex test, Lysholm score, Tegner score and IKDC score, were prospectively collected until at least 10 months post-operative. Results: The average values of KT 2000 were (1.47±1.17) mm and (1.68±1.14) mm for the SB and DB ACL reconstruction groups at 30° of knee flexion (P >0.05), and were (1.04±0.98) mm and (1.13±0.98) mm at 90° of knee flexion (P >0.05). There were also no significant differences in Lysholm score, Tegner score, IKDC score and Biodex test scores between the two groups (P >0.05).

We conducted a randomized, prospective study. Forty patients were randomized to the DB group (20 patients) and the SB group (20 patients). Four-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis autologous grafts were used in the SB group and in the DB group the conventional four tunnel technique was carried out using the same tendons. The IKDC complete form was used for the preoperative evaluation, and in the follow-up the IKDC subjective knee evaluation form, IKDC current health assessment form and IKDC knee examination form were used. Anteroposterior (AP) laxity was evaluated by standardised and forced radiology in all patients. No significant preoperative between-group differences were found. During the follow-up, no differences were found between groups, except for significant between-group differences (P < 0.05) between the preoperative and postoperative evaluations. The IKDC index also showed significant differences in the 2-year follow-up. Median scores increased from 48 (range 41-54) to 81 (range 75-87) (P = 0.01) in the SB group and from 52 (range 46-58) to 80 (range 72-88) (P = 0.02) in the DB group. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of functional scores. In conclusion, the 2 and 10 o'clock placements showed no significant differences between SB and DB techniques in the pivot-shift test, manual and radiological anterior posterior laxity and IKDC scores.

The evaluation methods were clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometric measurement, the International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores, and MRI. There were no differences between the groups preoperatively. Fifty-five patients (89%) were available at a minimum of 2-year follow-up (range 24-36 months). There was tunnel widening in both groups, but the increase was significantly greater in the AP dimension of the femoral tunnel in the bioabsorbable screw group compared to metal group (P = 0.01). The tibial tunnels showed no intergroup difference. Ninety-four percent of the knees were normal or nearly normal according to the IKDC scores and the average Lysholm score was 91 with no intergroup difference. The follow-up AP tibial tunnel diameter was smaller with normal knee laxity compared to abnormal knee laxity. The graft failure rate in the bioabsorbable screw group was 23% (7/31 patients) and 6% (2/31 patients) in the metal screw group.

Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective comparison between two populations: in the first, rehabilitation was limited to the early postoperative period (PO); in the second, rehabilitation sessions were repeated, once in the early postoperative period and again 90 days later (POR). The second rehabilitation period lasted two or three weeks and included an open and closed-chain muscle training program controlled by physical therapists using isokinetic devices. The sessions also included proprioceptive exercises and cardiovascular exercise reconditioning with a therapeutic project developed by the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation physician in collaboration with other health professionals and taking into consideration the surgical recommendations and the patient's clinical status. A questionnaire was addressed to all patients one year after the operation. The response rate was 55 %. Two groups were created at random: 74 patients were in the PO group and 75 in the POR group. The two populations were comparable in terms of gender (64 men, 10 women in PO versus 57 men and 18 women in POR), sports level (regional, national, international), type of surgery (41 hamsting, 33 bone-patellar tendon-bone in PO and 43 hamstring and 32 bone-patellar tendon-bone in POR) and sports (generally rugby, soccer, handball or ski). Results: Our results were statistically in favor of the group POR in terms of resumption of sports activities: time to return to training (7.6 versus 8.7 months, p = 0.03) and time to return to competition (9.06 versus 10.84 months, p = 0.007). They were also in favor of the group POR for resumption of sports activities at the former level (52.05 % versus 19.44 %, p = 0.001), pain (numerical scale: 1.52 versus 2.03, p = 0.021) and subjective impression (IKDC subjective score: 87.58 % versus 81.64 %, p = 0.003). There was no significant difference for resumption of training (90.50 % versus 81.69 %, p = 0.2) or competition (71.80 % versus 56.76 %, p = 0.1) at one year, but the results were close to the level of significance. Discussion: Adapted preparation before returning to sports activities using a scheme elaborated by specialists (physicians, physical therapists, trainers) provided a statistically significant improvement in time and quality of resumed activity (return to prior level, pain, subjective IKDC score) in this specific population of high-level competition athletes.

In these studies, however, the number of patients was insufficient to compare the clinical results of the 2 procedures. Hypothesis: The anatomic double-bundle procedure may be significantly better concerning the anterior laxity and the pivot-shift test than the single-bundle procedure, while there may be no significant differences in the other clinical evaluations and the intraoperative and postoperative complications between the 2 procedures. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Three hundred and twenty-eight patients with unilateral ACL reconstruction using hamstring autografts were divided into 2 groups. The first 157 consecutive patients underwent single-bundle reconstruction and the remaining 171 patients underwent anatomic double-bundle reconstruction. Concerning all background factors, there were no statistical differences between the 2 groups. Each patient was examined 2 years after surgery. Results: No serious complications were experienced in either group. The anterior laxity was significantly less in the double-bundle reconstruction (mean, 1.2 mm) than in the single-bundle reconstruction (mean, 2.5 mm). In the pivot-shift test, the double bundle (+ indication, 16%; ++, 3%) was significantly better than the single bundle (+ result, 37%; ++, 12%). The mean Lysholm score averaged 96.5 points and 97.3 points in single-bundle and double-bundle reconstructions, respectively, while the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation showed that 90 and 110 patients, respectively, were evaluated as rank A (no significant difference between groups). There were no significant differences in the other clinical evaluations and the complications between the 2 procedures.

Methods: We prospectively selected 35 patients surgically treated for anterior knee instability. The patients were randomly assigned to either the study group (group A) (19 patients) or the control group (group B) (16 patients). A modified harvesting technique of the semitendinosus, which reserves its distal insertion, was performed in group A, with the aim to allow a better postoperative recovery of flexion and internal rotation strength. Patients in group B underwent a ""standard"" harvesting technique. All patients were postoperatively evaluated by clinical examination, isokinetic tests, and magnetic resonance imaging. Results: At a follow-up of 25 months, all patients showed satisfactory postoperative knee stability. Isokinetic tests showed a significant deficit in internal rotation strength at 60°/s in patients in group B (84.60% v 97.37% in patients in group A). No deficits were found in group A. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluations showed a higher percentage of regenerated semitendinosus in group A patients (100%) than that in group B patients (50%) at the joint line level. In group A, the site of reinsertion was found to be on the pes anserinus in 71% of the patients and in the posteromedial corner of the tibial plateau in the other 29%; in group B, a distal signal was detected in 50% of the patients, which was at the posteromedial corner of the tibia in every case.

Box 211, Amsterdam, Netherlands.","Hamstring tendon autograft has become a popular graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, but there is no consensus on the ideal technique of fixation. We performed a pilot randomized controlled study to compare the clinical and mechanical outcome of two femoral fixation techniques for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using hamstrings graft. We recruited 30 patients with a chronic unilateral tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. In all patients, quadrupled hamstring graft was used for ACL reconstruction. In 15 patients, femoral graft fixation was performed using Bio-interference Screws fixation (Arthrex, Inc. Naples USA) (Group 1). In the other 15 patients, femoral graft fixation was performed using BioTransFix femur extra cortical transverse fixation (Arthrex, Inc. Naples USA) (Group 2). In both groups, tibial fixation was achieved with a Delta bio-absorbable interference screw (Arthrex). Both groups were comparable with regard to demographic data, pre-operative activity level, mechanism of injury, interval between the injury and the operation, and pre-operative knee laxity measurements. An independent observer, who was blinded with regard to the involved leg and the type of graft, performed the outcome assessment with the use of a Rolimeter® arthrometer (Aircast), and the International Knee Documentation Committee. At 13 months follow up, all patients except one had functionally normal or nearly normal IKDC objective scores. The mean IKDC subjective score was 83.38 ± 9.4 in Group 1 and 79.92 ± 11.01 in Group 2 (P > .05). The side to side laxity as measured with the Rolimeter® arthrometer was 1.5 mm ± 1 (range 0-3) for Group 1, and 2 mm ± 1 (range 0-3) for Group 2 (P > .05). Femoral Biotransfix fixation and Bio-interference Screws fixation provide comparable mechanical stability and clinical outcome at 13 months follow up. BiotransFix fixation is an effective alternative to other devices. Our preliminary study shows that there is no evidence to prefer femoral transfixation to the more traditional, technically less demanding, and more economical interference screw fixation.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is usually performed by arthroscopic procedure that, even if minimally invasive, may elicit an inflammatory joint reaction detrimental to articular cartilage. In this study the effect of I-ONE PEMFs treatment in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction was investigated. The study end-points were (1) evaluation of patients' functional recovery by International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Form; (2) use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), necessary to control joint pain and inflammation. The study design was prospective, randomized and double blind. Sixty-nine patients were included in the study at baseline. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 30, 60 and 180 days, followed by 2-year follow-up interview. Patients were evaluated by IKDC Form and were asked to report on the use of NSAIDs. Patients were randomized to active or placebo treatments; active device generated a magnetic field of 1.5 mT at 75 Hz. Patients were instructed to use the stimulator (I-ONE) for 4 h per day for 60 days. All patients underwent ACL reconstruction with use of quadruple hamstrings semitendinosus and gracilis technique. At baseline there were no differences in the IKDC scores between the two groups. At follow-up visits the SF-36 Health Survey score showed a statistically significant faster recovery in the group of patients treated with I-ONE stimulator (P < 0.05). NSAIDs use was less frequent among active patients than controls (P < 0.05). Joint swelling resolution and return to normal range of motion occurred faster in the active treated group (P < 0.05) too. The 2-year follow-up did not shown statistically significant difference between the two groups. Furthermore for longitudinal analysis the generalized linear mixed effects model was applied to calculate the group × time interaction coefficient; this interaction showed a significant difference (P < 0.0001) between the active and placebo groups for all investigated variables: SF-36 Health Survey, IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation and VAS. Twenty-nine patients (15 in the active group; 14 in the placebo group) underwent both ACL reconstruction and meniscectomy; when they were analysed separately the differences in SF-36 Health Survey scores between the two groups were larger then what observed in the whole study group (P < 0.05). The results of this study show that patient's functional recovery occurs earlier in the active group. No side effects were observed and the treatment was well tolerated. The use of I-ONE should always be considered after ACL reconstruction, particularly in professional athletes, to shorten the recovery time, to limit joint inflammatory reaction and its catabolic effects on articular cartilage and ultimately for joint preservation.",,,,English,English,,18385980,L50109854,10.1007/s00167-008-0519-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-008-0519-9,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L50109854&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-008-0519-9&atitle=Effects+of+biophysical+stimulation+in+patients+undergoing+arthroscopic+reconstruction+of+anterior+cruciate+ligament%3A+Prospective%2C+randomized+and+double+blind+study&stitle=Knee+Surg.+Sports+Traumatol.+Arthroscopy&title=Knee+Surgery%2C+Sports+Traumatology%2C+Arthroscopy&volume=16&issue=6&spage=595&epage=601&aulast=Benazzo&aufirst=Francesco&auinit=F.&aufull=Benazzo+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=595-601&date=2008&auinit1=F&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Purpose: This trial was conducted to compare postoperative outcomes in patients using an ACL functional knee brace and patients using a neoprene knee sleeve. Hypothesis: Patients using a brace will have superior outcomes than those using a sleeve. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: One hundred fifty patients were randomized to receive a brace (n = 76) or neoprene sleeve (n = 74) at their 6-week postoperative visit after primary ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft. Patients were assessed preoperatively, then 6 weeks and 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Outcome measures included disease-specific quality of life (Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Quality of Life [ACL-QOL] Questionnaire), anterior tibial translation (KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference), the single-limb forward hop test (limb symmetry index), and Tegner Activity Scale. Outcomes at 1 and 2 years were compared after adjusting for baseline scores. Subjective ratings of how patients felt while using the brace/sleeve were also collected for descriptive purposes using a questionnaire. Four a priori directional subgroup hypotheses were evaluated using tests for interactions. Results: There were no significant differences between brace (n = 62) and sleeve (n = 65) groups for any of the outcomes at 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Adjusted mean differences at 2 years were as follows: -0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], -7.52 to 5.64) for the ACL-QOL Questionnaire, -0.10 mm (95% CI, -0.99 to 0.81) for KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference, -0.87% (95% CI, -8.89 to 7.12) for hop limb symmetry index, and -0.05 (95% CI, -0.72 to 0.62) for the Tegner Activity Scale. Subjective ratings of confidence in the knee provided by the brace/sleeve were higher for the brace group than the sleeve group. Subgroup findings were minimal. Adverse events were few and similar between groups. Conclusions: A functional knee brace does not result in superior outcomes compared with a neoprene sleeve after ACL reconstruction.

Hypothesis: There is no difference in postoperative range of motion or stability after ACL reconstructions performed either acutely or delayed. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients with an acute ACL tear were prospectively randomized to either early (within 21days) or delayed (beyond 6 weeks) reconstruction using autograft hamstring tendon. Previous knee surgery on the index extremity and a multiligamentous injury were exclusionary criteria. Surgical technique and postoperative rehabilitation were identical for all patients. Postoperative assessments included range of motion and KT-1000 arthrometer measurements compared with the contralateral knee. Standardized outcome measures were used including single assessment numeric evaluation (SANE), Lysholm, and Tegner Activity Score. Results: Seventy consecutive patients were enrolled, and 1 patient was dropped after a postoperative infection. Sixty-nine patients (34 acute, 35 delayed) with an average age of 27 years composed the study cohort. The mean time from injury to surgery was 9 days (range, 2-17 days) for patients in the early group and 85 days (range, 42-192) for those in the delayed group. The average follow-up from surgery was 366 days (range, 185-869). Articular cartilage and meniscal injuries were comparable between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in degrees of extension or flexion lost relative to the nonoperative side, operative time, KT-1000 arthrometer differences, or subjective knee evaluations. Conclusion: Excellent clinical results can be achieved after ACL reconstructions performed soon after injury using autograft hamstrings. Although the authors do not advocate that all reconstructions should be performed acutely, they found that early ACL reconstructions do not result in loss of motion or suboptimal clinical results as long as a rehabilitation protocol emphasizing extension and early range of motion is employed. © 2008 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",,,,English,English,2008147775,18212347,L351433302,10.1177/0363546507312164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546507312164,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L351433302&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=03635465&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546507312164&atitle=Postoperative+range+of+motion+following+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction+using+autograft+hamstrings%3A+A+prospective%2C+randomized+clinical+trial+of+early+versus+delayed+reconstructions&stitle=Am.+J.+Sports+Med.&title=American+Journal+of+Sports+Medicine&volume=36&issue=4&spage=656&epage=662&aulast=Bottoni&aufirst=Craig+R.&auinit=C.R.&aufull=Bottoni+C.R.&coden=AJSMD&isbn=&pages=656-662&date=2008&auinit1=C&auinitm=R,"Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A prospective series of 41 patients underwent primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by one surgeon, arthroscopically and electronically assisted; 37 were men and 4 were women with a mean age of 24.7 years. The mean follow-up was19.05 (12-30) months. Normal function and joint stability was achieved. The patients returned to full occupational activities within 3-6 months after the operation. The function of hamstrings was not disturbed. Two patients have sustained a new injury without rupture of the grafts. The Noulis-Lachman test was negative in 35 knees. Positive Pivot shift, post-operatively, was present in 15.45% of patients. The IKDC score was 84.55. In the proposed ACL reconstruction technique, the two tendons are transferred and used as grafts, with gracillis and semitendinosus retaining their distal and central attachment, respectively; the former superimposed upon the latter while entering the femoral tunnel. The tibial tunnels leave a bone bridge ranging between 12 and 15 mm within the footprints of ACL. The two bundles are tensioned, each at different angle. This configuration imitates both the anatomy and the function of ACL and controls not only the anterior translation, but also the rotatory stability. With this innovative technique, the final outcome is improved, thus being closer to normal, as evidenced from previous experiments and the present prospective series. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",,,,English,English,,17934715,L351434108,10.1007/s00167-007-0426-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-007-0426-5,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L351434108&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-007-0426-5&atitle=Arthroscopic+ACL+reconstruction+with+%CE%94+plasty%3A+An+innovative+approach+with+hamstrings%27+transfer+and+double+tibial+tunnel&stitle=Knee+Surg.+Sports+Traumatol.+Arthroscopy&title=Knee+Surgery%2C+Sports+Traumatology%2C+Arthroscopy&volume=16&issue=4&spage=420&epage=426&aulast=Papachristou&aufirst=George&auinit=G.&aufull=Papachristou+G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=420-426&date=2008&auinit1=G&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

METHODS: Thirty-two cases of ACL injury (3 cases compound with PCL injury) were reviewed. All the patients were divided into two groups randomly. Fifteen cases were reconstructed with hamstring tendon, including 12 male and 3 female with the age ranging from 23 to 61 years. Seventeen cases were reconstructed with allograft, including 11 male and 6 female with the age ranging from 17 to 57 years. The tendons were fixed with absorbable or Ti screws. All patients were recorded symptoms,physical signs and Lysholm Scores two weeks after operation,and functional rehabilitation of knee six months after operation. RESULTS: All cases were followed up from 6 to 8 months. Pain and clinical symptoms disappeared and the function of knee joint was improved in all patients. Five patients of allograft with positive Lachman test result,one with severe graft rejection was found complete absorption of allograft under arthroscopy. No significant differences were seen in Lysholm Score between the two groups,average (88.5 +/- 7.2), (93.2 +/- 8.5) after operation (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The effects of reconstruction of cruciate ligaments with allogeneic tendon or autologous hamstring tendon under arthroscopy are more satisfying. But there are more symptoms and obvious individual differences in the earlier stage of rehabilitation.

But up to now there are only a few clinical investigations comparing both techniques in a prospective manner. We hypothesized that double-bundle ACL reconstruction reveals superior clinical and subjective results compared to single-bundle technique in a high-demand collective. A total of 50 male patients (mean age 29.4 years) were prospectively randomized consecutively into one of the two reconstruction techniques. Group 1 (SB) underwent a 4-stranded single-bundle reconstruction with a ST graft in femoral position at 10:00 and 02:00 o'clock, respectively. In group 2 (DB), reconstruction was performed by using a 2-stranded ST graft with double-bundle, four tunnel technique. Before surgery and at a 2 year follow-up (range 23-25 months) patients were evaluated by the same blinded observer. There was no significant difference in the side-to-side anterior laxity-measurement with the KT-1000 between both groups. As evaluated by the pivot shift, no significant correlation could be noted (Fisher exact test P = 0.098) between rotational stability and any of the both reconstruction techniques. However, the anterior and rotational stability improved significantly at 2-year follow-up compared to preoperatively (P = 0.003) in both groups. The statistical analysis showed a significant increase for the IKDC (subjective, objective) and the Lysholm Score at final follow-up among each single technique, while we found no significant difference between the two reconstruction methods. On the basis of our investigation, we conclude that reconstruction of the ACL by a double-bundle ST graft with an extracortical anchorage can achieve excellent clinical results. But in contrast to our initial hypothesis, we could not quote any significant advantages by creating two independent bundles. Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in conventional single-bundle technique with a more horizontal femoral tunnel placement obtains comparable clinical results in the present high-demand collective. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,,,English,English,,18193194,L50036237,10.1007/s00167-007-0480-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-007-0480-z,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L50036237&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-007-0480-z&atitle=Reconstruction+of+the+ACL+with+a+semitendinosus+tendon+graft%3A+A+prospective+randomized+single+blinded+comparison+of+double-bundle+versus+single-bundle+technique+in+male+athletes&stitle=Knee+Surg.+Sports+Traumatol.+Arthroscopy&title=Knee+Surgery%2C+Sports+Traumatology%2C+Arthroscopy&volume=16&issue=3&spage=232&epage=238&aulast=Streich&aufirst=Nikolaus+A.&auinit=N.A.&aufull=Streich+N.A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=232-238&date=2008&auinit1=N&auinitm=A,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Hypothesis: A comprehensive rehabilitation program supplemented with quadriceps strengthening in open kinetic chain (OKC) exercise will increase quadriceps strength and improve knee function without increasing static or dynamic sagittal tibial translation, compared with the same comprehensive rehabilitation program supplemented with quadriceps strengthening in closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise, in patients with acute ACL deficiency. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Forty-two patients were tested a mean of 43 days (range, 20-96 days) after an ACL injury. Patients were randomized to rehabilitation with CKC quadriceps strengthening (11 men and 9 women) or OKC quadriceps strengthening (13 men and 9 women). Aside from these quadriceps exercises, the 2 rehabilitation programs were identical. Patients were assessed after 4 months of rehabilitation. Sagittal static translation and dynamic tibial translation were evaluated with a CA-4000 electrogoniometer. Muscle strength, jump performance, and muscle activation were also assessed. Functional outcome was evaluated by determining the Lysholm score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Results: There were no group differences in static or dynamic translation after rehabilitation. The OKC group had significantly greater isokinetic quadriceps strength after rehabilitation (P =.009). The hamstring strength, performance on the 1-repetition-maximum squat test, muscle activation, jump performance, and functional outcome did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Rehabilitation with OKC quadriceps exercise led to significantly greater quadriceps strength compared with rehabilitation with CKC quadriceps exercise. Hamstring strength, static and dynamic translation, and functional outcome were similar between groups.

Saunders, Independence Square West, Philadelphia, United States.","Purpose: Biomechanical studies show increased anterior and rotational stability with double-bundle (DB) compared to single-bundle (SB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of four-tunnel DB ACL reconstruction. Methods: Seventy patients undergoing arthroscopic hamstring ACL reconstruction were prospectively randomized to DB (n = 35) or SB (n = 35) groups. Each bundle fixation was by means of a femoral EndoButton CL and a tibial biodegradable interference screw. Demographic data were comparable between groups, and the average age of all patients was 29 years. The average follow-up was 19 months for both groups and included a history, clinical evaluation with knee scores, and radiographs. Results: The subjective results were similar in groups. The subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 score was 88 P for DB versus 90 P for SB; the Lysholm score was 90 P for DB versus 93 P for SB; and the Cincinnati knee score was 91 P for DB versus 92 P for SB. The objective IKDC was significantly higher for DB: 78% ""A"" (P < .000) and 19% ""B"" compared to 24% ""A"" and 68% ""B"" for SB. The average KT-1000 side-to-side difference was 1.0 mm for DB and 1.6 mm for SB (P = .054) and the pivot shift test was negative in 97% for DB (P = .01) and 71% for SB. The range of motion was comparable for both groups.

Methods: The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind investigation. We randomized 30 patients to the low tunnel position group and 30 to the high tunnel position group. Four-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis single-bundle grafts were used. At follow-up, the patients were examined according to the IKDC evaluation form and the IKDC examination form. The exact measurements of laxity at 25° and 70° were performed by use of the Rolimeter (Aircast, Boca Raton, FL). Standardized radiographs were evaluated. Results: In total, 26 patients in the low tunnel position group and 25 in the high tunnel position group completed the study. At follow-up, we found no significant difference in the laxity at 25° and 70° or scores on the IKDC examination form. We found a significant difference in the scores on the IKDC evaluation form, favoring the low position, with a subjective score of 82.8 versus 70.4. Conclusions: A change in the femoral tunnel placement from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock did not result in a detectable change in the sagittal laxity at 25° and 70°, on the pivot-shift test, or on the IKDC examination form scores. However, we found a significant difference between the two groups in the scores on the IKDC evaluation form, most evident in the subgroups dealing with the patient's subjective knee stability. We conclude that it is possible to improve the clinical result in 1-bundle ACL reconstruction by lowering the tibial tunnel angle and thereby lowering the femoral tunnel toward the 2-o'clock position.

The successful treatment of an ACL deficient knee aims to preserve the intact meniscus and chondral structures, and to provide a functionally stable knee so that patients can return to pre-injury activities and restore their quality of life. The current standard of care for ACL deficient knees is with a surgical ACL reconstruction procedure. A Cochrane Review was done and demonstrated that the existing literature is controversial. To date, no existing trial has used validated patient-based outcome assessment, accounted for the critical differences between acute and chronic ACL deficiency or used modern techniques to ensure randomization concealment and a sufficient sample size to avoid type II error. The existing information does not define graft failure or re-ruptures, involve long-term follow-up to address osteoarthritis development, nor compare outcomes between single- and double-bundle reconstructive techniques. The current standard includes either a patellar tendon or quadruple semitendinosus/gracilis tendon autograft reconstruction. The newest option is a double-bundle semitendinosus/gracilis graft. This option attempts to restore the complex ACL anatomy by using two separate tendon components to reconstruct the ACL. This study will measure disease-specific quality of life at short- and long-term post-operative intervals (1, 2, 5 and 10 years). Additional secondary outcomes, including the incidence of traumatic re-ruptures and graft failures, will also be compared between treatment groups.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT00529958,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00529958,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT00529958&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

We investigated whether minimal debridement of the intercondylar notch and the residual stump of the ruptured ACL leads to earlier revascularisation in ACL reconstruction in humans. We undertook a randomised controlled clinical trial in which 49 patients underwent ACL reconstruction using autologous four-strand hamstring tendon grafts. Randomised by the use of sealed envelopes, 25 patients had a conventional clearance of the intercondylar notch and 24 had a minimal debridement method. Three patients were excluded from the study. All patients underwent MR scanning post-operatively at 2, 6 and 12 months, together with clinical assessment using a KT-1000 arthrometer and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation. All observations were made by investigators blinded to the surgical technique. Signal intensity was measured in 4 mm diameter regions of interest along the ACL graft and the mid-substance of the posterior cruciate ligament. Our results indicate that minimal debridement leads to earlier revascularisation within the mid-substance of the ACL graft at two months (paired t-test, p = 0.002). There was a significant reduction of mid-substance signal six months after the minimal debridement technique (paired t-test, p = 0.00007).

Saunders, Independence Square West, Philadelphia, United States.","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical results of a double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with 4 strands versus 8 strands of hamstring tendon graft. Methods: Seventy-six patients with chronic ACL rupture were randomly separated into two groups for double-bundle ACL reconstruction. In the 4-strand hamstring graft (4SHG) group, the semitendinosus tendon was used to make two 2-stranded hamstring tendon grafts, whereas in the 8-strand hamstring graft (8SHG) group, the semitendinosus tendon was used to make one 4SHG and the gracilis tendon was used to make the other 4SHG. The 4SHG group comprised 33 patients and the 8SHG group comprised 35 patients, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scales were used to evaluate the clinical results. Results: In the 4SHG group the side-to-side difference was less than 3 mm in 26 patients (78.8%), 3 to 5 mm in 4 patients (12.1%), and 6 to 10 mm in 3 patients (9.0%), with a mean value of 2.8 ± 0.5 mm; the pivot-shift test was negative in 29 patients (89.9%) and positive in 4 (12.1%). In the 8SHG group the side-to-side difference was less than 3 mm in 32 patients (91.4%), 3 to 5 mm in 2 patients (5.7%), and 6 mm in 1 patient (2.9%) (P = .004), with a mean value of 1.3 ± 0.4 mm (P = .0003); the pivot-shift test was negative in 34 patients (97.1%) and positive in 1 (2.9%). According to the IKDC scale, 29 patients (87.9%) in the 4SHG group and 33 patients (94.3%) in the 8SHG group had a grade of normal or nearly normal. In the 4SHG and 8SHG groups the mean IKDC subjective knee evaluation results were 86.4 ± 4.2 and 96.3 ± 2.8 (P = .0007), respectively, and the mean Lysholm scores were 89.6 ± 3.7 and 96.5 ± 2.9 (P = .0006), respectively. Conclusions: On the basis of KT-1000 examination (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) and clinical measures, double-bundle ACL reconstruction with 8SHG yields significantly better results than double-bundle ACL reconstruction with 4SHG, with a mean side-to-side difference in anterior knee laxity of 1.3 ± 0.4 mm versus 2.8 ± 0.5 mm (P = .0003), IKDC subjective result of 96.3 ± 2.8 versus 86.4 ± 4.2 (P = .0007), and Lysholm score of 96.5 ± 2.9 versus 89.6 ± 3.7 (P = .0006).

Methods: We divided 68 patients with unilateral ACL injury into 2 groups according to their birth date, and they were followed up in person for a mean of 25 months (range, 18 to 41 months). Each group of 34 patients underwent either DB or SB ACL reconstruction using 4-strand ST with EndoButton femoral fixation (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy, Andover, MA) and anchor staple tibial fixation. There was no difference between the 2 groups with regard to age at surgery, sex, follow-up period, period before surgery, combined meniscus injuries, and athletic activity level. All patients followed the same postoperative program. They were evaluated using manual knee laxity tests, instrumented anterior laxity measurements (KT-1000 arthrometer [MEDmetric, San Diego, CA]), knee extension and flexion strength testing, and so on. General knee condition was evaluated by use of the Lysholm knee score and subjective rating scale. Results: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to range of motion, thigh girth, muscle strength, and Lysholm score. Manual knee laxity testing revealed that negative Lachman and pivot-shift test results were found in more patients in the DB group than in the SB group. KT measurements averaged 2.4 mm in the SB group and 1.4 mm in the DB group, which was statistically significantly different. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference regarding all of the modified International Knee Documentation Committee-categorized data between the 2 groups. Conclusions: This randomized controlled trial indicated that DB ACL reconstruction via 4-strand ST is superior to the SB technique with regard to anterior and rotational stability; however, it fails to show any subjective difference.

The purpose of this prospective, randomized clinical study is to compare the outcomes of ACL reconstruction when using either double-bundle or single-bundle technique and bioabsorbable interference screw fixation, and similar rehabilitation with both techniques. Sixty-five patients were randomized into either double-bundle (n = 35) or single-bundle (n = 30) ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendons and bioabsorbable screw (Hexalon, Inion Company, Tampere, Finland) fixation in both groups. The evaluation methods were clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, radiographic evaluation, as well as International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm knee scores. There were no differences between the study groups preoperatively. For an average of 14 months of follow-up (range 12-20 months), 30 patients of the double-bundle group and 29 patients of the single-bundle group were available (91%). At the follow-up, the rotational stability, as evaluated by pivot shift test, was significantly better in the double-bundle group than in the single-bundle group. However, in anterior stability of the knee, there was no significant difference between the groups.

Hypothesis: In the long-term, ACL reconstruction using BTB autografts will render more donor-site problems than ST autografts. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A randomized series of 71 patients (22 women and 49 men) with a unilateral ACL rupture who underwent reconstructive surgery were included in the study. The BTB graft was used in 34 patients (BTB group) and the ST-tendon graft was used in 37 patients (ST group). The patients were examined a median of 86 months (range, 68 to 114 months) after the reconstruction. Results: Sixty-eight of 71 patients (96%) were examined at follow-up. The clinical assessments at follow-up revealed no significant differences between the BTB group and the ST group in terms of the Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation system, 1-legged hop test, KT-1000 arthrometer laxity measurements, manual Lachman test, and range of motion. A significant improvement was seen in both groups compared with the preoperative values in terms of most clinical assessments. Donor-site morbidity in the form of knee-walking ability, kneeling ability, and area of disturbed anterior knee sensitivity revealed no significant differences between the groups. Conclusion: Seven years after ACL reconstruction, the subjective and objective outcomes were similar after using the central-third BTB autograft and triple/quadruple ST autograft. Furthermore, no difference in terms of donor-site morbidity was found between the 2 groups. © 2007 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",,,,English,English,2007301223,17293471,L46956288,10.1177/0363546506298275,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546506298275,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L46956288&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=03635465&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546506298275&atitle=Patellar+tendon+or+semitendinosus+tendon+autografts+for+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+A+prospective%2C+randomized+study+with+a+7-year+follow-up&stitle=Am.+J.+Sports+Med.&title=American+Journal+of+Sports+Medicine&volume=35&issue=5&spage=740&epage=748&aulast=Lid%C3%A9n&aufirst=Mattias&auinit=M.&aufull=Lid%C3%A9n+M.&coden=AJSMD&isbn=&pages=740-748&date=2007&auinit1=M&auinitm=,"Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Sixty-eight patients, 36 males and 32 females, with either patellar tendon graft (34 patients) or hamstring graft (34 patients) were enrolled in this study. All patients were randomly allocated to either early (the 4th postoperative week) or late (the 12th postoperative week) start of OKC exercises for the quadriceps, resulting in four subgroups: patellar tendon reconstruction, early start (P4) or late start (P12) of OKC quadriceps exercises, hamstring tendon reconstruction, early start (H4) or late start (H12) of quadriceps OKC exercises. Prior to surgery and 3, 5 and 7 months later, assessments of range of motion (goniometer), anterior knee laxity (KT-1000), postural sway (KAT 2000), thigh muscle torques (Kin-Com dynamometer) and anterior knee pain (anterior knee pain score) were evaluated. No significant group differences were found in terms of range of motion 3, 5 and 7 months postoperatively. The H4 group showed a significantly higher mean difference of laxity over time of 1.0 mm (CI: 0.18-1.86) than the P4 group (P = 0.04). Within the same type of surgery, the H4 against the H12, the mean difference over time was 1.2 mm (0.37-2.1) higher in the H4 group than in the H12 group (P = 0.01). There were no significant group differences in terms of postural sway or anterior knee pain at the different test occasions. Significant differences in trends (changes over time) were found when comparing the four groups, for both quadriceps muscle torques (P < 0.001) and hamstring muscle torques (P < 0.001). All groups, except the P4 group, reached preoperative values of quadriceps muscle torques at the 7 months follow-up. In the H4 and the H12 groups, significantly lower hamstring muscle torques at the 7 months follow-up compared with preoperative values were found. In conclusion, early start of OKC quadriceps exercises after hamstring ACL reconstruction resulted in significantly increased anterior knee laxity in comparison with both late start and with early and late start after bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, the early introduction of OKC exercises for quadriceps did not influence quadriceps muscle torques neither in patients operated on patellar tendon nor hamstring tendon grafts. On the contrary, it appears as if the choice of graft affected the strength of the specific muscle more than the type of exercises performed. Our results could not determine the appropriate time for starting OKC quadriceps exercises for patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft. Future studies of long-term results of anterior knee laxity and functional outcome are needed. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,,,English,English,,17219226,L46537522,10.1007/s00167-006-0246-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-006-0246-z,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L46537522&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-006-0246-z&atitle=Early+versus+late+start+of+open+kinetic+chain+quadriceps+exercises+after+ACL+reconstruction+with+patellar+tendon+or+hamstring+grafts%3A+A+prospective+randomized+outcome+study&stitle=Knee+Surg.+Sports+Traumatol.+Arthroscopy&title=Knee+Surgery%2C+Sports+Traumatology%2C+Arthroscopy&volume=15&issue=4&spage=402&epage=414&aulast=Heijne&aufirst=Annette&auinit=A.&aufull=Heijne+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=402-414&date=2007&auinit1=A&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Few studies have compared the differences in outcome after reconstruction using similar fixation methods. Hypothesis: Similar outcomes will be seen after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone or quadruple-strand semitendinosus/gracilis tendons fixed with bioabsorbable interference screws. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Ninety-nine patients were prospectively randomized to bone-patellar tendon-bone (46 patients) or quadruple-strand semitendinosus/gracilis (53 patients) reconstruction groups. The bone-patellar tendon-bone group had slightly lower preinjury Tegner scores (6.7 vs 7.1, P =.03); otherwise, the groups were similar. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using an endoscopic technique with bioabsorbable interference screw fixation. Patients were evaluated at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Results: Forty-six bone-patellar tendon-bone and 50 quadruple-strand semitendinosus/gracilis patients were available at 24 months (97%). No differences in International Knee Documentation Committee grade, Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, range of motion, single-legged hop test, KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum difference, Short Form-36, or patient knee rating were found. The bone-patellar tendon-bone group had better flexion strength in the operated leg than in the nonoperated leg (102% vs 90%, P =.0001), fewer patients complaining of difficulty jumping (3% vs 17%, P =.03), and a greater number of patients returning to preinjury Tegner level (51% vs 26%, P =.01). The quadruple-strand semitendinosus/gracilis group had better extension strength in the operated leg than in the nonoperated leg (92% vs 85%, P =.04), fewer patients with sensory deficits (14% vs 83%, P =.0001), and fewer patients with difficulty kneeling (6% vs 20%, P =.04). Both groups showed significant improvement in KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum difference, Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, International Knee Documentation Committee grade, and patient knee rating score.

Prospective randomized long-term studies are needed to determine the differences between the materials. Hypothesis: Five years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, there is a difference between hamstring and patellar tendon grafts in development of degenerative knee joint disease. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: From June 1999 to March 2000, 64 patients were included in this prospective study. A single surgeon performed primary arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in an alternating sequence. In 32 patients, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed with hamstring tendon autograft, whereas in the other 32 patients, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed with patellar tendon autograft. Results: At the 5-year follow-up, no statistically significant differences were seen with respect to the Lysholm score, clinical and KT-2000 arthrometer laxity testing, anterior knee pain, single-legged hop test, or International Knee Documentation Committee classification results; 23 patients (82%) in the hamstring tendon group and 23 patients (88%) in the patellar tendon group returned to their preinjury activity levels. Graft rupture occurred in 2 patients from the hamstring tendon group (7%) and in 2 patients from the patellar tendon group (8%). Grade B abnormal radiographic findings were seen in 50% (13/26) of patients in the patellar tendon group and in 17% (5/28) of patients in the hamstring tendon group (P = .012). Conclusion: Both hamstring and patellar tendon grafts provided good subjective outcomes and objective stability at 5 years. No significant differences in the rate of graft failure were identified.

Purpose: To compare the clinical and radiographic results in arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using 4-strand hamstring tendon grafts and either metallic (metal group) or biodegradable (PLLA group) interference screw fixation. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A randomized series of 77 patients, all with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture, was included in the study. The preoperative assessments in both groups were similar in gender, Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, and single-legged hop test results. In both groups, interference screw fixation of the graft was used at both ends, and 68 of 77 (88%) patients returned for a radiographic examination at 6 and 24 months, respectively. Results: At follow-up, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in KT-1000 arthrometer laxity measurements, Tegner activity level, or Lysholm score.

Successful ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon (PT) and hamstring tendon (HT) grafts combined with a well-structured rehabilitation program could bring athletes back to their previous level of sport activities. We prospectively followed-up 100 athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction with either PT (n=50) or HT grafts (n=50). Evaluation was done pre-operatively and post-operatively (3, 6, 12, and 24 months) using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, Noyes, and Tegner scales. Subjective assessment numeric evaluation (SANE), knee activity rating scale (Marx) and a psychological profile questionnaire (psychovitality) were also utilized. Objective evaluations included isokinetic tests and computerized knee motion analysis. Data gathered were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric U-test. Among the 100 patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction, 65% returned to the same level of sports, 24% changed sports and 11% ceased sport activities. No significant difference (P>0.05) in outcome between PT and HT grafts were observed. No significant differences (P>0.05) were noted between athletes who ""returned"" to their previous sport and those who ""did not return"" to sports at the same level when using the IKDC, Lysholm, Noyes, and Tegner knee evaluation scales. However, significant difference was observed with the knee scores obtained by those who returned and those who completely ceased participation in sport activities. Computerized laxity test revealed that 90% of these patients have less than 3 mm side-to-side difference with no significant difference between HT and PT groups. Patients who ""returned to sports"" obtained significantly better scores with the Marx scale (P=0.001) and the psychovitality questionnaire (P=0.001) than those who did not. Conventional knee scales including IKDC, Lysholm, Noyes, and Tegner remain as reliable means of evaluating outcome of ACL reconstruction. However, the data obtained from these are not sufficient to determine which among the patients who had knee reconstruction can successfully return to sport. The use of the Marx knee activity rating scale and the evaluation of the athletes' psychological profile are additional scales that can be useful in determining which among the patients treated have a better chance of returning to their pre-injury activity levels. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,,,English,English,,16496124,L44496644,10.1007/s00167-006-0050-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-006-0050-9,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L44496644&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-006-0050-9&atitle=Factors+affecting+return+to+sports+after+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction+with+patellar+tendon+and+hamstring+graft%3A+A+prospective+clinical+investigation&stitle=Knee+Surg.+Sports+Traumatol.+Arthroscopy&title=Knee+Surgery%2C+Sports+Traumatology%2C+Arthroscopy&volume=14&issue=10&spage=1021&epage=1028&aulast=Gobbi&aufirst=Alberto&auinit=A.&aufull=Gobbi+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1021-1028&date=2006&auinit1=A&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

The ACL-reconstruction using the transfixation device at the femoral side leads to less knee laxity and therefore to a better clinical outcome for the patient. Prospective randomized clinical outcome study. From February 2002 to December 2002, a total of 68 patients with hamstring ACL reconstruction using a femoral fixation once with TransFix (n=38; m:22 and f:16; median age=28.5 range 15-47) and the second with bioscrew (BS) (n=30; m:20, f:10; median age=25.5 range 13-61) completed the follow-up period. Patients in each group got a clinical assessment at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The measurement of anterior translation of the tibia has been performed using the Rolimeter® device. No significant differences in the knee laxity testing using the Rolimeter device were seen between both groups and over time within these groups. Ninety percent of all patients had functionally normal or near normal International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee ligament ratings. The TF-group included 17 grade A, 19 grade B, and 2 grade C knees, and the BS-group had 12 grade A, 13 grade B, and 5 grade C knees. The IKDC rating, the OAK-score, the Tegner-activity-score, and the Lysholm-score did not show significant differences between the TF-group and the BS-group. We disproved our hypothesis that the transfixation technique leads to less laxity and therefore to a better clinical outcome when compared to the use of BS. The clinical results in this study clarified that this technique is an effective and safe method for femoral hamstring fixation in ACL-reconstruction. However, this technique revealed no advantage compared to the bioscrew fixation technique within the short-term follow-up. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",,,,English,English,,16465537,L44598205,10.1007/s00167-006-0034-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-006-0034-9,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L44598205&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-006-0034-9&atitle=Prospective+randomized+clinical+comparison+of+femoral+transfixation+versus+bioscrew+fixation+in+hamstring+tendon+ACL+reconstruction+-+A+preliminary+report&stitle=Knee+Surg.+Sports+Traumatol.+Arthroscopy&title=Knee+Surgery%2C+Sports+Traumatology%2C+Arthroscopy&volume=14&issue=8&spage=730&epage=738&aulast=Rose&aufirst=Tim&auinit=T.&aufull=Rose+T.&coden=&isbn=&pages=730-738&date=2006&auinit1=T&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Type of Study: Prospective comparative cohort study. Methods: Seventy-two patients with unilateral ACL-deficient knees were randomly divided into 3 groups. Concerning all background factors, there were no statistical differences among the 3 groups. In group S (n = 24), single-bundle ACL reconstruction was performed. In group N-AD (n = 24), nonanatomic double-bundle reconstruction was carried out. In group AD (n = 24), anatomic double-bundle reconstruction was performed. One surgeon performed all operations using hamstring tendon autografts. Each patient underwent clinical examinations, before surgery and at 2 years. Results: No intraoperative and postoperative complications were experienced in each group. There were no significant differences concerning the time for operation among the 3 groups. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the postoperative side-to-side anterior laxity among the 3 groups (P = .006). The laxity was significantly less (P = .002) in group AD (1.1 mm) than in group S (2.8 mm), while there was no significant difference (P = .072) between groups AD and N-AD. Concerning the pivot-shift test, group AD was significantly superior to group S (P = .025). There were no significant differences in the range of knee motion, the muscle torque, and the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation. Conclusions: On the basis of the KT-2000 measurement, the side-to-side anterior laxity of our anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction was significantly better than that of the single-bundle reconstruction with the hamstring tendon graft, although there were no significant differences in the other clinical measures among any of the 3 procedures.

Purpose: To compare patellar tendon and hamstring tendon grafts with the same fixation method used to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: During the reconstructive procedure, the hamstring tendon graft was prepared as a bone-hamstring-bone graft; both bone-patellar tendon-bone and bone-hamstring-bone grafts were fixed with interference screws. Eighty consecutive patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were randomly assigned to either bone-patellar tendon-bone or bone-hamstring-bone groups. Follow-up examinations were performed for at least 5 years postoperatively. Seventy-two of the 80 patients (37 patients in the bone-patellar tendon-bone group and 35 in the bone-hamstring-bone group) were evaluated, with a mean follow-up period of 87.0 and 80.8 months, respectively. Follow-up examinations were performed using the International Knee Documentation Committee knee ligament standard and subjective knee forms. Results: The mean KT-1000 arthrometer evaluation results showed no significant difference between the bone-patellar tendon-bone and bone-hamstring-bone groups (1.2 ± 2.1 mm and 1.7 ± 1.4 mm, respectively; P = .24). However, symptoms related to graft harvest (anterior kneeling pain) were more frequently observed in the bone-patellar tendon-bone group, and unsatisfactory results were correlated with severe kneeling pain in 3 patients from this group (P = .0056). Significant hamstring muscle weakness without complaint of functional deficit was found in the bone-hamstring-bone group (P = .0045). Conclusion: Bone-hamstring-bone grafts were shown to reduce the risk of problems at the graft harvest site compared to bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts, with comparable results in the remaining clinical parameters tested. © 2006 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",,,,English,English,2006052008,16282583,L43152957,10.1177/0363546505279919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546505279919,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L43152957&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=03635465&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546505279919&atitle=A+comparison+of+bone-patellar+tendon-bone+and+bone-hamstring+tendon-bone+autografts+for+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction&stitle=Am.+J.+Sports+Med.&title=American+Journal+of+Sports+Medicine&volume=34&issue=2&spage=213&epage=219&aulast=Matsumoto&aufirst=Akio&auinit=A.&aufull=Matsumoto+A.&coden=AJSMD&isbn=&pages=213-219&date=2006&auinit1=A&auinitm=,"Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Type of Study: Prospective randomized study. Methods: One hundred patients were included and randomized and 87 patients were assessed at a 1-year follow-up. The evaluation included standardized radiographs, KT-1000 data, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) ratings, and Lysholm score. The diameter of the tunnel at the 1 year follow-up was, after correction for magnification, compared with the tunnel diameter of the radiograph from 2 weeks postoperatively. A more than 2-mm enlargement was considered TW. Results: In group A in which transfixation in the femur and interference screw in the tibia was used, 7 of 41 patients had developed femoral TW and 5 of 41 tibial TW. In group B, 20 of 46 patients had TW in the femur and 16 of 46 in the tibia (P < .05, χ-square test). No significant difference was found with respect to Lysholm score, IKDC, or arthrometric evaluation. Conclusions: There was a significant reduction of TW in both the femur and the tibia using fixation points close to the joint, compared with the system where the distance between the fixation points is long. We conclude that the position of the fixation sites and type of fixation device are major factors in the development of TW after ACL surgery.

Bone Tunnel Widening Following ACL Reconstruction,,,,,,5/14/2025,5/14/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2005). Date of Publication: 13 Sep 2005,clinicaltrials.gov,2005,,,,,13-Sep-05,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryHypothesis 1: There is less tunnel-widening with bone-patella tendon-bone graft compared with the hamstring graft when the same fixation method is used. Tunnel widening is greater with achilles tendon allografts versus autograft bone-patella tendon-bone and hamstring autografts. Hypothesis 2: Tunnel widening occurs in the early post-operative period (\< 8 weeks) when the tendon remodels within the bone tunnels. Hypothesis 3: Low pre-operative bone mineral density is associated with tunnel widening.Detailed DescriptionThis will be a prospective study for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction using bone-patella tendon-bone graft, hamstring graft or achilles allograft. Each group will have ACL reconstruction with fixation using bioabsorbable interference screws on the femoral and tibial side. Patients will be evaluated on the day of surgery, 6, 12, 24, 52 and 104 weeks post-operatively. Evaluations will include pre-operative regional and standard bone mineral density measurements, post-operative MRI evaluation of tunnel dimensions and bone-tendon interface, radiographic evaluation of tunnel dimensions and routine clinical follow-up. Interventions or Observations - outline specific procedures, treatments and/or interventions, as well as sources of research material to be utilized, which will involve human subjects or human materials that will be part of this research project. This study will require a pre-operative bone mineral density measurement in the Nuclear Medicine Division of the Department of Radiology at HSS. Standard measurements of the femoral neck, spine as well as regional studies of the distal femur and proximal tibia of the injured knee will be performed. On the day of surgery, the patient will undergo ACL reconstruction using bioabsorbable interference screw fixation of the hamstring, bone-patella tendon-bone graft, or achilles allograft. This is a standard procedure. The choice of graft type (hamstring, bone-patella tendon-bone graft, or achilles allograft) will be discussed with the patients and the patient will decide graft type pre-operatively. In this study, we will standardize the fixation method by using bioabsorbable interference screws. Post-operatively, the patient will undergo a limited MRI scan to evaluate the tunnel dimensions as well as graft placement prior to discharge from the hospital. During the patients' 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks clinical follow-up, they will be evaluated by their orthopaedic surgeon for clinical progress. Standard radiographs will be obtained of the patient's knee at the 6 weeks and 24 weeks follow-up visit. These are standard radiographic evaluations and are of no additional charge to the patients. We will utilize these images for radiographic measurements of tunnel expansion. During these visits, the patients will also undergo limited MRI scan of the femoral tunnel and tibia tunnel. With the serial MRI images, we will be able to make accurate measurements of the femoral and tibial tunnels. In addition, we will be able to evaluate the bone-tendon interface as well as the maturation of the intra-articular portion of the ACL graft. At 24, 52 and 104 weeks the patients will also be given standard IKDC and Lysholm clinical knee outcome questionnaires and will have objective stability measurements of both the operative and non-operative knees using a KT-1000 instrument. Overall Study Protocol: Pre-operative work-up 1. Bone mineral density measurement by D.E.X.A. Day of Surgery: 1. ACL reconstruction using bioabsorbable interference screws 2. Limited CT scans to quantitate tunnel dimensions 6 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up 2. Regular plain radiographs to quantitate tunnel dimensions 3. Limited MRI scans to quantitate tunnel dimensions 12 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up 2. Limited MRI scans to quantitate tunnel dimensions 24 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up and KT-1000 measurements 2. Regular plain radiographs to quantitate tunnel dimensions 3. MRI study to evaluate tendon-bone interface, graft maturation, tunnel dimensions and trabecular remodeling 4. Patients will answer IKDC and Lysholm knee questionnaires 52 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up and KT-1000 measurements 2. Patients will answer IKDC and Lysholm knee questionnaires 3. Limited MRI 104 weeks post-operatively 1. Regular clinical follow-up and KT-1000 measurements 2. Patients will answer IKDC and Lysholm knee questionnaires 3. Limited MRI Number of Subjects (power justification for numbers) A power analysis was performed to determine the number of subjects needed to determine significance between the hamstring and bone-patella tendon-bone group. Data from previous studies demonstrate tunnel widening up to 77 ± 28% following ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendons. We estimate that a 30% decrease in this amount of tunnel widening would be clinically significant. This extrapolates to a 54% increase in tunnel dimensions. Using these estimations, a power of 0.80 with α = 0.5 is achieved using 20 subjects per group (BPTB versus hamstring).",,,,English,English,,,LNCT00198042,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00198042,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT00198042&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Type of study: A prospective randomized comparison of patellar tendon (PT) versus semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (STG) autografts for ACL reconstruction. Methods: Between 1994 and 1996, 85 consecutive male patients with chronic ACL-deficient knees underwent arthroscopically assisted reconstruction with either autologous PT or double-loop STG (4-strand) graft. PT grafts were used in patients with even-numbered birth dates and STG grafts for those with odd-numbered birth dates. Preoperatively, no significant differences between the 2 groups were noted with respect to age, level of activity, and degree of laxity (χ-square analysis). A standardized rehabilitation program was used for both groups postoperatively that included immediate active extension and early weight bearing and gradual flexion. Return to sports was permitted 8 months postoperatively. Assessment of the patients was carried out using a questionnaire, clinical assessment, Lysholm knee scores, the International Knee Documentation Committee scale, and radiological examination. Results: At a mean follow-up of 81 months, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to subjective complaints (recurrent giving way, functional level) or objective laxity evaluation, including KT-1000 measurement or return to sports. Loss of extension of ≤5° was greater in the PT group (12 patients, 30%) than in the STG group (8 patients, 17%). There was loss of flexion of ≤15° in 5 patients (12%) in the PT group and 1 patient (2.2%) in the STG group. Anterior knee pain was recorded in 10 patients (24%) in the PT group and 3 patients (5%) in the STG group. The Lysholm knee score was 91.6 and 92.7 for the PT and STG groups, respectively, and the Tegner activity score decreased from 8.9 preoperatively for both groups to 7.9 for the PT group and 7.8 for the STG group. Conclusion: In this study, the 2 groups had comparable results in terms of patient satisfaction, activity level, and knee function. Our study showed that patellofemoral problems and loss of knee motion are more frequent in patients with PT grafts than in those with STG grafts.

Results: We did not find any significant difference between the 2 groups according to the standard knee scores; self-evaluation score; clinical findings; computerized knee laxity analysis; flexion, extension, and external rotation strengths; or functional tests. However, we did note that the internal rotation torque deficit was significantly higher in the STG group (P =. 039). Likewise, the external-to-internal rotation ratio was significantly greater in the STG group (P =. 006). Conclusions: Although there is not much clinical difference when using the ST alone versus the STG construct, internal rotation weakness following harvest of 2 tendons may need to be evaluated further. We suggest that, whenever possible, only 1 tendon should be used when performing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendons.

Arthroscopic ACL replacement by autologous tendon grafts has established itself as a standard of care. Data from both experimental and observational studies suggest that surgical reconstruction does not fully restore knee stability. Persisting anterior laxity may lead to recurrent episodes of giving-way and cartilage damage. This might at least in part depend on the method of graft fixation in the bony tunnels. Whereas resorbable screws are easy to handle, pins may better preserve graft tension. The objective of this study is to determine whether pinning of ACL grafts reduces residual anterior laxity six months after surgery as compared to screw fixation. Design/ Methods: SPOT is a randomised, controlled, patient and investigator blinded trial conducted at a single academic institution. Eligible patients are scheduled to arthroscopic ACL repair with triple-stranded hamstring grafts, conducted by a single, experienced surgeon. Intraoperatively, subjects willing to engage in this study will be randomised to transplant tethering with either resorbable screws or resorbable pins. No other changes apply to locally established treatment protocols. Patients and clinical investigators will remain blinded to the assigned fixation method until the six-month follow-up examination. The primary outcome is the side-to-side (repaired to healthy knee) difference in anterior translation as measured by the KT-1000 arthrometer at a defined load (89 N) six months after surgery. A sample size of 54 patients will yield a power of 80% to detect a difference of 1.0 mm ± standard deviation 1.2 mm at a two-sided alpha of 5% with a t-test for independent samples. Secondary outcomes (generic and disease-specific measures of quality of life, magnetic resonance imaging morphology of transplants and devices) will be handled in an exploratory fashion. Conclusion: SPOT aims at showing a reduction in anterior knee laxity after fixing ACL grafts by pins compared to screws. © 2005 Stengel et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,,English,English,2005133143,15723704,L40390009,10.1186/1471-2482-5-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-5-1,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L40390009&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14712482&id=doi:10.1186%2F1471-2482-5-1&atitle=Resorbable+screws+versus+pins+for+optimal+transplant+fixation+%28SPOT%29+in+anterior+cruciate+ligament+replacement+with+autologous+hamstring+grafts%3A+Rationale+and+design+of+a+randomized%2C+controlled%2C+patient+and+investigator+blinded+trial+%5BISRCTN17384369%5D&stitle=BMC+Surg.&title=BMC+Surgery&volume=5&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Stengel&aufirst=Dirk&auinit=D.&aufull=Stengel+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2005&auinit1=D&auinitm=,"Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Methods: Fifty-six female patients divided into 2 groups (standard tibial fixation with 7 x 25-mm metal interference screw versus metal interference screw with supplementary staple fixation) were followed for 2 years.

Type of Study: Prospective randomized clinical follow-up study. Methods: Sixty-two patients were randomized into either TransFix cross-pin (Arthrex, Naples, FL) (TransFix group, n = 31) or metal interference screw femoral fixation (screw group, n = 31) in ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendons. The distal fixations were an AO screw with spiked washer post and metal interference screw. The evaluation methods were clinical examination, CA 4000 laxity (OSI, Hayward, CA), and Lido isokinetic muscle torque measurements (Lido MultiJoint II; Loredon, West Sacramento, CA) as well as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner activity level, Lysholm knee, and Kujala patellofemoral scores. Results: There were no differences between the study groups preoperatively. For the 2-year follow-up, 26 patients of the TransFix group and 30 patients of the screw group were available (90%). The evaluation methods disclosed no statistical differences between the groups at the 1- or 2-year follow-up examinations.

In order to improve the biological conditions around the graft within the tunnel, we have developed a surgical technique using a periosteal flap. The periosteal flap is harvested at the superior and medial metaphysis of the tibia and wrapped around the proximal part of the four strands of gracilis and semitendinosus tendons near the outlet of the femoral tunnel.

The objective of this study was to determine in a prospective, randomized clinical trial whether two grafts (bone-patellar tendon-bone or doubled hamstring tendons) fixed with modern devices affect the two-year minimum clinical and radiographic outcomes of anterior cruclate ligament reconstruction. Methods: One hundred and twenty patients with a chronic unilateral rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent arthroscopically assisted reconstruction with use of either autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone or doubled hamstring tendon grafts, in a strictly alternating manner. Both groups were comparable with regard to demographic data, preoperative activity level, mechanism of injury, interval between the injury and the operation, and the amount of knee laxity present preoperatively. The same well-proven surgical technique and aggressive controlled rehabilitation was used. An independent observer, who was blinded with regard to the involved leg and the type of graft, performed the outcome assessment with use of a visual analog scale, the new International Knee Documentation Committee form, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, the Functional Knee Score for Anterior Knee Pain, and an arthrometric and an isokinetic dynamometric evaluation. Radiographs were also made. Results: At the two-year follow-up evaluation, no differences were found in terms of the visual analog score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, the new International Knee Documentation Committee subjective and objective evaluation scores, the KT-1000 side-to-side laxity measurements, the Functional Knee Score for Anterior Knee Pain, muscle strength recovery, or return to sports activities. In the bone-patellar tendon-bone group, we found a higher prevalence of postoperative kneeling discomfort (p < 0.01) and an increased area of decreased skin sensitivity (p < 0.001). In the hamstring tendon group, we recorded a higher prevalence of femoral tunnel widening (p < 0.01). In this group, a correlation was also found between medial meniscectomy and an increased prevalence of pivot-shift glide (p = 0.035). Conclusions: We believe that, with use of accurate and proven surgical and rehabilitation techniques, both grafts are an equivalent option for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Fifty patients, undergoing an ACL reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, were postoperatively allocated randomly to either a plaster cast or a brace for 5 weeks. The brace group had ROM exercises from postoperative day 7. The commencement of ROM exercises was postponed 4 weeks for the plaster group compared to the brace group, but progressed subsequently with equal speed. There was no difference between the groups in the ROM of flexion or extension 20 weeks after the ACL reconstruction and later. Twenty-four months after surgery, the muscle strength deficit in the hamstring muscles (isokinetic measurements; percent difference, injured vs uninjured) was significantly larger in the brace group (mean +/- SD: 5.9 +/- 7.8%, P < 0.01) than in the plaster group (- 0.9 +/- 11.8%, NS) (brace vs plaster group, P < 0.05).

It is concluded that the postoperative treatment with early range of motion training after ACL reconstruction gave as good ROM, knee stability, subjective knee function and activity level as the treatment with immobilization.

Methods: Fifty-six patients with a torn anterior cruciate ligament were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Twenty-eight underwent reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, and twenty-eight were treated with a two-strand semitendinosus-gracilis autograft. Patients were followed for an average of thirty-nine months (range, thirty-six to fifty-seven months). At the time of final follow-up, twenty-two patients in each group were evaluated in terms of clinical test findings, patient satisfaction, activity level, functional status, and isokinetic muscle strength. Results: The objective outcome of replacement of the torn anterior cruciate ligament with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was superior to that obtained with a two-strand semitendinosus-gracilis graft. At the three-year follow-up interval, the patients in whom a hamstring graft had been used had an average of 4.4 mm of increased anterior knee laxity compared with the laxity of the contralateral, normal knee, whereas the patients in whom a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had been used had an average of 1.1 mm of increased knee laxity. Fourteen percent (three) of the twenty-two patients with a hamstring graft had a mild pivot shift, and 27% (six) had a moderate pivot shift. Only 14% (three) of the twenty-two patients with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had a mild pivot shift, and none had a moderate pivot shift. At the same follow-up interval, the patients in whom a hamstring graft had been used had significantly lower peak knee-flexion strength than those who had a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (p = 0.039). In contrast, the two treatments produced similar outcomes in terms of patient satisfaction, activity level, and knee function (ability to perform a one-legged hop, bear weight, squat, climb stairs, run in place, and duckwalk). Conclusions: After three years of follow-up, the objective results of anterior cruciate ligament replacement with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft were superior to those of replacement with a two-strand semitendinosusgracilis graft with regard to knee laxity, pivot-shift grade, and strength of the knee flexor muscles.

One patient suffered early graft rupture and 89 (84%) of the remaining 106 patients were able to attend the follow-up within the given time limit. There were no differences in sick leave between the groups. The Lysholm score, Tegner activity level score and Visual Analog Scales (VAS) with the questions ""How does your knee function?"" and ""How does your knee affect your activity level?"" revealed no differences between the groups. Subjective patellofemoral pain, patellofemoral compartment findings and donor site morbidity were more common in the BTB group, P < 0.05. Lachman test grade 1+ was more common in the ST group, P < 0.05, but there was no significant difference in instrumented Lachman side-to-side comparison. The ST group scored better in the one-leg hop test than the BTB group, P < 0.05. No correlations between these clinical and functional findings and subjective knee function scores were found.

We studied anterior knee laxity, thigh muscle torque, and return to preinjury sports level in 44 patients with unilateral ACL; group 1 carried out quadriceps strengthening only with CKC while group 2 trained with CKC plus OKC exercises starting from week 6 after surgery. Anterior knee laxity was determined with a KT-1000 arthrometer; isokinetic concentric and eccentric quadriceps and hamstring muscle torque were studied with a Kin-Com dynamometer before and 6 months after surgery. At an average of 31 months after surgery the patients answered a questionnaire regarding their current knee function and physical activity/sports to determine the extent and timing of their recovery. No significant differences in anterior knee laxity were noted between the groups 6 months postsurgery. Patients in group 2 increased their quadriceps torque significantly more than those in group 1, but no differences were found in hamstring torque between the groups. A significantly higher number of patients in group 2 (n = 12) than in group 1 (n = 5) returned to sports at the same level as before the injury (P < 0.05). Patients from group 2 who returned to sports at the same level did so 2 months earlier than those in group 1. Thus the addition of OKC quadriceps training after ACL reconstruction results in a significantly better improvement in quadriceps torque without reducing knee joint stability at 6 months and also leads to a significantly higher number of athletes returning to their previous activity earlier and at the same level as before injury.",,,,English,,,11147151,L33421621,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L33421621&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:&atitle=Closed+kinetic+chain+alone+compared+to+combined+open+and+closed+kinetic+chain+exercises+for+quadriceps+strengthening+after+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction+with+respect+to+return+to+sports%3A+a+prospective+matched+follow-up+study.&stitle=Knee+Surg+Sports+Traumatol+Arthrosc&title=Knee+surgery%2C+sports+traumatology%2C+arthroscopy+%3A+official+journal+of+the+ESSKA&volume=8&issue=6&spage=337&epage=342&aulast=Mikkelsen&aufirst=C.&auinit=C.&aufull=Mikkelsen+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=337-342&date=2000&auinit1=C&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed in the STG-endobutton group with a 1.5-T imager. There were no statistical differences between the groups with respect to clinical findings, stability tests, or knee scores. In the STG-endobutton group the average femoral and tibial bone tunnel diameter detected on anteroposterior view radiography had increased at 2-year follow-up by 33% and 23%, respectively. On MRI the ligamentous graft itself was not enhanced by the contrast medium whereas periligamentous tissue within and around the STG graft bundles showed mild contrast enhancement.
