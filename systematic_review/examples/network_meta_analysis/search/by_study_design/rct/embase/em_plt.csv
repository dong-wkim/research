Patients and methods: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 ± 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 ± 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 ± 3.9 (range = 85–100). Conclusion: Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.

Methods: The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. Results: A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18–20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group. Conclusions: PL tendon autograft can be used as a safe and effective autograft choice for ACLR with excellent functional outcomes comparable to HST tendon autograft and minimal donor site morbidity.

Recent interest has focused on the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) as a potential alternative to hamstring tendons (HT) due to its biomechanical properties and potential advantages. However, comparative studies assessing functional outcomes between PLT and HT in ACLR are lacking. We conducted a cross‐sectional study involving 60 ACL injury cases treated with ACL reconstruction using either hamstring or peroneus longus tendon grafts. Patient selection was randomized, and assessments included preoperative planning, surgery under spinal or combined spinal‐epidural anesthesia, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols. Functional scores were assessed using the Lysholm Knee Score and IKDC Score at various follow‐up intervals. Both groups showed favorable outcomes in terms of knee stability and functional scores. There were no statistically significant differences in Lysholm and IKDC scores between the two groups at any time point during the follow‐up period. Additionally, postoperative complications did not significantly differ between the groups. The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autografts yields comparable outcomes to hamstring tendon autografts in terms of knee stability and functional scores. The use of peroneus longus tendon grafts may offer advantages such as larger size, satisfactory ankle function preservation and avoidance of potential complications associated with hamstring graft harvesting. Thus, peroneus longus tendon autografts could be considered a safe and viable option for ACL reconstruction, particularly in specific patient populations showing a preference for this approach.",,,,English,English,,,L2035509225,10.59218/makrjms.2024.3.254.259,http://dx.doi.org/10.59218/makrjms.2024.3.254.259,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2035509225&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=19936095&id=doi:10.59218%2Fmakrjms.2024.3.254.259&atitle=Comparative+Study+Between+Functional+Outcome+of+Knee+with+ACL+Recontruction+Using+Hamstring+Graft+vs+Peroneus+longus+Graft&stitle=Res.+J.+Med.+Sci.&title=Research+Journal+of+Medical+Sciences&volume=18&issue=3&spage=254&epage=259&aulast=Siddique&aufirst=Mohammed+Sohail&auinit=M.S.&aufull=Siddique+M.S.&coden=&isbn=&pages=254-259&date=2024&auinit1=M&auinitm=S,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

While various autograft options exist for ACL reconstruction, each has associated drawbacks. The peroneus longus tendon has emerged as a promising alternative, but literature on its functional outcomes remains limited. The objective is to evaluate the functional outcomes of primary ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 31 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft at BLDE (Deemed to be University) Shri B. M. Patil Medical College, Hospital & Research Centre from August 2022 to January 2024. Patients were followed up for 12-21 months. Functional outcomes were assessed using Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Return to pre-injury activity levels and complications were also evaluated. Result: The mean Lysholm score improved from 46.41 ± 6.5 preoperatively to 96.61 ± 3.22 at 12 months postoperatively. The mean IKDC score increased from 41.87 ± 6.91 preoperatively to 91.12 ± 6.86 at 12 months postoperatively. Both improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Twenty-eight patients (91%) returned to their pre-injury activity level, with 20 (64.5%) resuming sports activities. Minor complications were observed in 16.2% of cases, with no major complications requiring revision surgery. Conclusion: ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft demonstrates excellent functional outcomes, high rates of return to pre-injury activity levels, and a low complication rate.

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied.Methods:Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared.Results:The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up.Conclusions:PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level II.

Reconstruction of this ligament with hamstring tendon has been time-tested but peroneus longus autograft is also gaining popularity. However, very limited literature is available comparing the two grafts. This study aims to compare the functional outcome and donor site morbidity between hamstrings and peroneus longus autograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: A prospective randomised study was conducted on 45 patients, who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were assigned into Hamstring group and the Peroneus longus group. Functional outcome was assessed using Lysholm score and Modified Cincinnati scores for the knee joint and American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Scoring for ankle joint. Donor site morbidity was assessed by measuring flexion and extension strength of the knee and plantar flexion and eversion strength of the ankle by handheld dynamometer preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and 1 year follow up. Results: Functional outcome of the knee showed significant improvement in peroneus longus group (p-value 0.002) compared to hamstring group. Even though there was minimal reduction in functional outcome of the ankle at 6 months follow-up in peroneus longus group, it improved at one year follow-up. While assessing the donor site morbidity at the knee joint, knee flexion strength showed improvement in the group (p-value 0.02) but reduced in the hamstring group where the hamstring tendon was harvested. Knee extension strength in the hamstring group scored marginally better than the peroneus longus group, which was not statistically significant (p-value 0.5). Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint.",,,,English,English,,,L2015583944,10.1177/22104917221088335,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/22104917221088335,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2015583944&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=22104925&id=doi:10.1177%2F22104917221088335&atitle=Is+Peroneus+longus+autograft+a+better+alternative+to+the+Hamstring+autograft+for+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3F+%E2%80%93+A+randomised+control+study&stitle=J.+Orthop.+Traum.+Rehabil.&title=Journal+of+Orthopaedics%2C+Trauma+and+Rehabilitation&volume=29&issue=1&spage=&epage=&aulast=Vijay&aufirst=&auinit=C.&aufull=Vijay+C.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=C&auinitm=,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. Purpose: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-N·m force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P =.863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 ± 0.83–cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL–posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 ± 1.02–cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 ± 1.35–cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P =.154). Conclusion: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height. Clinical Relevance: The side-to-side difference in heel height may be a clinically relevant examination tool for diagnosing multiligament knee injuries.",,,,English,English,,,L2015581725,10.1177/23259671221086669,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23259671221086669,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2015581725&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=23259671&id=doi:10.1177%2F23259671221086669&atitle=Determining+the+Roles+of+the+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament%2C+Posterolateral+Corner%2C+and+Medial+Collateral+Ligament+in+Knee+Hyperextension+Using+the+Heel-Height+Test&stitle=Orthop.+J.+Sports+Med.&title=Orthopaedic+Journal+of+Sports+Medicine&volume=10&issue=4&spage=&epage=&aulast=Perry&aufirst=Allison+K.&auinit=A.K.&aufull=Perry+A.K.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2022&auinit1=A&auinitm=K,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0 ± 3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Tunnel positions, which were confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomical positions. At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4 ± 7.1 vs. 89.3. ± 8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71 ± 0.57 vs. 1.85 ± 0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15 ± 0.36 vs. 0.10 ± 0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1 ± 1.40 vs. 99.5 ± 1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up. An AHPLT autograft may be a good alternative for all-inside ACL reconstruction with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity.",,,,English,English,20180121878,29421837,L620767532,10.1055/s-0038-1627466,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1627466,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L620767532&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=19382480&id=doi:10.1055%2Fs-0038-1627466&atitle=All-Inside+Single-Bundle+Reconstruction+of+the+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+with+the+Anterior+Half+of+the+Peroneus+Longus+Tendon+Compared+to+the+Semitendinosus+Tendon%3A+A+Two-Year+Follow-Up+Study&stitle=J.+Knee+Surg.&title=Journal+of+Knee+Surgery&volume=31&issue=10&spage=1022&epage=1030&aulast=Bi&aufirst=Mingguang&auinit=M.&aufull=Bi+M.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1022-1030&date=2018&auinit1=M&auinitm=,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
