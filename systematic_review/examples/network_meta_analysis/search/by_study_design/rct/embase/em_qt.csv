METHODS: While 153 patients were prospectively recruited and randomized to an ST or STG autograft, 131 (62 ST and 69 STG) were retained following ACLR and followed post-surgery. Standardized surgical techniques were employed, varying only in graft selection and fixation. The primary study outcomes were early hamstring pain, donor site morbidity and strength recovery. However, several outcomes were assessed pre-surgery and at 3 and 6 months, encompassing the Donor-site-related Functional Problems following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (DFPACLR) score, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for hamstring pain and other commonly employed PROMs, anteroposterior laxity (KT-1000), isokinetic hamstring and quadriceps strength, hop testing, complications and re-operations. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using linear mixed models for continuous data and Mann-Whitney U tests where appropriate. RESULTS: At 6 months, ST patients reported significantly lower hamstring pain (p < 0.001) and DFPACLR (p < 0.001) scores. A significantly higher (p < 0.001) peak knee flexor strength limb symmetry index (LSI) was observed for the ST group, though no other group differences in side-to-side laxity, hop tests or other normalized strength measures or LSIs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: ACLR using an ST autograft resulted in less donor site pain and morbidity, and improved knee flexor strength symmetry at 6 months, while demonstrating comparable functional outcomes to the STG autograft.

Whole-body vibration (WBV), which can modulate quadriceps neuromuscular function has not yet been incorporated into ACL prehabilitation. The aim of this study was to determine whether the combination of WBV in a prehabilitation program could achieve a better knee function after ACLR by promoting quadriceps neuromuscular function during the preoperative period. Methods: A single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted. Forty-four participants with a primary, unilateral ACL rupture were randomly assigned to the control (N = 22) or the WBV group (N = 22). The control group underwent prehabilitation twice weekly for five weeks. The WBV group received the same prehabilitation plus WBV. Quadriceps neuromuscular function, including strength (maximal voluntary isometric contraction, MVIC), the early (rate of torque development from 0 to 50ms, RTD(0 − 50)), and the late phase (rate of torque development from 100 to 200ms, RTD(100 − 200)) of rapid contraction and inhibition (central activation ratio, CAR) in the injured limb, were measured at baseline and preoperatively. Knee function was assessed by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score at baseline, preoperatively, and 4 months postoperatively. The linear mixed effect models and multiple linear regression were used for the statistical analyses. Results: Forty participants completed interventions and 35 finished the postoperative follow-up. Preoperatively, the intervention demonstrated main effects on quadriceps MVIC (p = 0.002), RTD(0 − 50) (p = 0.024), RTD(100 − 200) (p = 0.005) and CAR (p = 0.043). Furthermore, the effect of time* intervention interaction was significant on quadriceps MVIC (p = 0.011). Postoperatively, the WBV group achieved higher IKDC scores than the control group (p = 0.006). The improvements in preoperative quadriceps MVIC and intervention contributed to better knee function post-ACLR (R(2) = 0.239, p = 0.007). Conclusions: Five weeks of WBV in prehabilitation enhanced quadriceps strength pre-ACLR and had potential to enhance knee function post-ACLR. WBV can be considered as an adjunct to prehabilitation protocols. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04988828.

The hypothesis for the current study is that ACL reconstruction using QT autograft results in better clinical outcomes than hamstrings tendon (HT). Methods: Patients underwent a single-bundle, all-inside ACL reconstruction after being randomized into QT and HT groups. At 12 months, objective outcomes (Lachman test, anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and side-to-side anterior translation measurement with KT-1000) and subjective outcomes (Lysholm and KOOS scores) were evaluated, along with donor site morbidity and graft failure. Results: Sixty-nine patients (QT: 33, HT: 36) were included in the final analysis. At 12 month follow-up, a negative Lachman test was found in 72.7% of cases in the QT group and 41.6% in the HT group (p = 0.04). Positive pivot shift was more frequent in the HT group (13.9% vs. 0%, p = 0.27), while KT-1000 showed greater anterior translation in the HT group than QT (3.77 ± 2.01 vs. 2.73 ± 1.64 mm, p = 0.23). Lysholm (92.4 vs. 88.2, p = 0.008) and KOOS (94.1 vs. 89.6, p = 0.01) scores were higher in the QT group. The only case of graft failure occurred in the HT group, which also had more sensory hypoesthesia (30.5%), while one patient in the QT group developed stiffness requiring arthrolysis. Conclusion: Quadriceps tendon autograft in ACL reconstruction offers superior translational stability and reduced donor site morbidity, with comparable PROMs and a trend toward improved rotational stability.

In ACL reconstruction (ACL-R), multiple autograft options are available, each with distinct advantages and limitations. The quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft has gained increasing attention due to its favorable biomechanical properties and lower donor site morbidity, yet studies comparing only athletic populations remains limited. This study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to compare QT autograft with bone-block (QT-B) with semitendinosus tendon (ST) autograft in athletes undergoing primary ACL-R. Methods: This is a single center RCT. Two Hundred ACL-R patients aged 16–40 years with a Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) of ≥ 7 prior to the ACL injury will be randomized to receive either a ST graft or a QT-B graft at the time of ACL-R. All participants will receive standard postoperative care and rehabilitation, followed by comprehensive follow-up. The primary outcome was the side-to-side (STS) difference in anterior tibial translation (ATT) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), isokinetic strength testing, imaging-based graft evaluation, surgical and clinical events, and 10-year radiographic evidence of joint degeneration. Detailed definitions and timepoints are provided in the full manuscript (Table 1). Discussion: This protocol is the first RCT comparing the ST autograft to the QT-B autograft exclusively in athletes with TAS ≥ 7 undergoing ACL-R. In addition, this trial has the ambition of including 200 patients, thereby making it the largest trial to compare these two grafts to date. The successful completion of the trial has the potential to change current practice and contribute to the existing knowledge regarding graft choice in athletes undergoing ACL-R.

Effects of Early Rehabilitation Using Blood Flow Restriction and/or Surface Electromyography Biofeedback on Quadriceps Activation and Strength After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,10/13/2025,10/13/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2025). Date of Publication: 21 Aug 2025,clinicaltrials.gov,2025,,,,,21-Aug-25,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryMany patients experience quadriceps inhibition after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, delaying strength recovery, hindering return to sport, and potentially increasing the risk of re-injury. Two rehabilitation strategies-low-load blood flow restriction (BFR) training and surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback-aim to enhance neuromuscular activation and strength while limiting joint load. However, comparative and combined evidence in pragmatic, multicenter settings remains limited. AMIRACL is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial with four arms enrolling 200 adults (18-35 years) undergoing a first-time ACL reconstruction. Participants are randomized with center stratification; outcome assessors are blinded to allocation. The four groups are: (1) standard rehabilitation; (2) standard + early BFR; (3) standard + early sEMG biofeedback; and (4) standard + combined BFR and sEMG biofeedback. Interventions begin about 2 weeks postoperatively, are delivered over 6 weeks at three supervised sessions per week, and are integrated into contemporary ACL rehabilitation. BFR uses individualized, auto-regulated cuff pressure during low-load isometric and then dynamic exercises. sEMG biofeedback provides real-time visual and/or auditory feedback to optimize quadriceps recruitment during targeted tasks. The combined arm receives both modalities concurrently. The primary objective is to compare quadriceps activation (sEMG) and maximal isometric knee extensor strength between groups at 3 and 6 months. Secondary objectives include return-to-sport readiness and patient-reported function (e.g., ACL-RSI, IKDC), broader knee outcomes (e.g., KOOS, Lysholm), adherence and adverse events across arms, and ACL re-injury (ipsilateral graft rupture or contralateral ACL injury) within 2 years. Longer-term patient-reported quality of life is explored up to 5 years. Key eligibility criteria include age 18-35 years, first ACL reconstruction, and preinjury sport participation; major exclusions include revision ACL surgery, concomitant multi-ligament repair, neuromuscular disorders, and contraindications to BFR or sEMG. The planned sample size is 200 (50 per arm), powered to detect a clinically meaningful between-group difference in quadriceps activation. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle using mixed-effects models for repeated measures. The study is conducted under Good Clinical Practice and applicable Swiss regulations; all participants provide written informed consent. Overall, AMIRACL will determine whether early BFR, sEMG biofeedback, or their combination meaningfully improves quadriceps activation, strength, and clinical recovery after ACL reconstruction compared with standard rehabilitation alone.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT07145606,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07145606,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT07145606&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

There were no statistically significant differences in strength between STx4 and ST-G at final follow-up (hamstrings in flexion [mean ± SD]: 173 ± 53 N vs. 166 ± 51 N, p = 0.7; hamstrings in extension: 204 ± 61 N vs. 199 ± 64 N, p = 0.8; quadriceps in flexion: 217 ± 42 N vs. 209 ± 47 N, p = 0.6; quadriceps in extension: 193 ± 51 N vs. 191 ± 46 N, p = 0.9). Conclusions: This study found no statistically significant differences at 2 years between a STx4 and a ST-G graft configuration for primary ACL reconstruction regarding strength, PROMs, return to sport, failure rates and complications; larger studies are required to confirm noninferiority.

Rehabilitation timing, particularly early versus delayed initiation, can influence postoperative muscle strength outcomes, especially in hamstring tendon autograft cases. While early rehabilitation may promote faster recovery, concerns about graft protection and joint stability have limited its universal adoption. This study aimed to compare the effects of early and delayed rehabilitation protocols on quadriceps and hamstring strength symmetry after ACLR using hamstring tendon autografts. Materials and Methods:A prospective comparative study was conducted on 60 patients (mean age: 26.4 ± 4.8 years) undergoing primary ACLR with semitendinosus-gracilisautograft. Patients were randomized into two groups: Early Rehabilitation Group (ERG) (n = 30), commencing structured physiotherapy within 2 weeks post-surgery, and Delayed Rehabilitation Group (DRG) (n = 30), starting at 6 weeks post-surgery. Isokinetic dynamometry assessed quadriceps and hamstring peak torque at 60°/s and 180°/s at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Strength symmetry index (SSI) was calculated as the ratio of the operated to non-operated limb strength × 100. Statistical analysis included repeated measures ANOVA with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: At 3 months, ERG demonstrated significantly higher quadriceps SSI (81.6 ± 5.3%) compared to DRG (72.4 ± 6.1%, p < 0.001) and hamstring SSI (86.9 ± 4.7% vs 78.2 ± 5.6%, p < 0.001). At 6 months, the differences persisted (quadriceps SSI: 91.2 ± 3.8% vs 85.4 ± 4.1%, p = 0.002; hamstring SSI: 93.1 ± 3.5% vs 88.0 ± 3.9%, p = 0.004). By 12 months, both groups achieved near-symmetrical strength, with no significant difference (quadriceps SSI: 97.3 ± 2.4% vs 96.1 ± 2.8%, p = 0.18). No graft failures or significant complications were reported in either group. Conclusion: Early initiation of rehabilitation following hamstring tendon autograft ACLR resulted in faster recovery of lower limb strength symmetry during the first 6 months post-surgery without increasing complication risk. However, by one year, both early and delayed protocols achieved comparable strength outcomes, suggesting early rehabilitation primarily benefits short- to mid-term recovery.",,,,English,English,,,L2040075838,10.69605/ijlbpr_14.7.2025.278,http://dx.doi.org/10.69605/ijlbpr_14.7.2025.278,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2040075838&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=22503137&id=doi:10.69605%2Fijlbpr_14.7.2025.278&atitle=Impact+of+early+versus+delayed+rehabilitation+protocols+on+lower+limb+strength+symmetry+after+hamstring+tendon+autograft+ACL+reconstruction&stitle=Int.+J.+Life+Sci.+Biotechnol.+Pharma+Res.&title=International+Journal+of+Life+Sciences+Biotechnology+and+Pharma+Research&volume=14&issue=7&spage=1656&epage=1660&aulast=Kadivar&aufirst=Yash&auinit=Y.&aufull=Kadivar+Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1656-1660&date=2025&auinit1=Y&auinitm=,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

METHODS: After recruitment and randomisation, 112 patients (HT = 55; QT = 57) underwent ACLR. Patients were assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months using the Kneeling Tolerance Test, which evaluates patient-reported pain in a position of both 90 (KT90) and 110 (KT110) degrees of knee flexion. PROMs collected included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire and the ACL Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) questionnaire. RESULTS: Kneeling tolerance at KT90 and KT110 improved (p < 0.05) for both graft types across all time points. There was no difference in KT90 scores between groups at 6 or 12 months. At 24 months, kneeling tolerance was superior in the QT group (mean HT 93 ± 9 vs. QT 98 ± 5; p = 0.003).

Knee Extensors Activation Device Versus Rolled Towel for Early Quadriceps Activation After ACL Reconstruction: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,10/13/2025,10/13/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2025). Date of Publication: 18 Jun 2025,clinicaltrials.gov,2025,,,,,18-Jun-25,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe goal of this clinical trial is to learn if a novel Knee Extensors Activation (KEA) device can improve quadriceps muscle activation in adults after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. The study focuses on adults aged 18-45 years undergoing primary unilateral ACL reconstruction, a population commonly affected by this injury. The main questions it aims to answer are: Does using the KEA device lead to greater quadriceps muscle activation (measured via EMG) by postoperative Day 5 compared to standard care using a rolled towel? Does the KEA device improve early knee function, reduce pain, and decrease fear of movement compared to the towel method? Researchers will compare participants using the KEA device versus a control group using the conventional rolled towel during early postoperative rehabilitation to see if the KEA device provides better outcomes. Participants will: Begin quadriceps strengthening exercises on the first day after ACL surgery. Be randomly assigned to use either the KEA device or a rolled towel for isometric quadriceps exercises. Perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions of knee extension exercises, twice daily for 5 consecutive days. Undergo assessment of quadriceps EMG activation and complete questionnaires (KOOS, IKDC, TSK, and VAS) on Day 5.Detailed DescriptionBACKGROUND Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and its surgical reconstruction are followed by substantial deficits in quadriceps muscle function. In the early postoperative period, reflexive inhibition of the quadriceps, known as arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), leads to drastically reduced voluntary muscle activation. Quadriceps activation failure contributes to weakness, which is concerning since quadriceps strength is strongly related to knee function and stability. Without effective intervention, patients can experience persistent strength deficits, delayed functional recovery, and even altered knee biomechanics due to inadequate quadriceps activation. Notably, one study reported that by 2 weeks after ACL reconstruction, the electromyographic (EMG) activation amplitude of the vastus medialis was less than 50% of normal levels, highlighting the severity of early postoperative quadriceps inhibition. Early rehabilitation therefore prioritizes reactivation of the quadriceps. Standard ACL rehabilitation protocols universally include quadriceps setting exercises beginning immediately after surgery. Quadriceps setting is an isometric contraction of the knee extensors (quadriceps) with the knee in extension, often performed with a rolled towel or bolster placed under the knee to provide a slight knee flexion angle and a target to press down against. This simple exercise is aimed at recruiting the quadriceps muscle and counteracting AMI as soon as possible. Clinical guidelines and expert consensus recommend initiating such isometric quadriceps contractions on post-op day 1 to restore active knee extension and prevent loss of motion. The conventional method using a rolled towel under the knee is easy and requires no special equipment; however, it provides minimal feedback to the patient. The patient or therapist typically counts repetitions, and the assessment of contraction quality (e.g. how hard the muscle is engaging) is largely subjective. Enhancing feedback during early exercises may improve quadriceps muscle recruitment. Prior studies have shown that adjunctive biofeedback modalities can significantly improve quadriceps activation and outcomes in early ACL rehabilitation. For example, it's demonstrated that adding electromyographic biofeedback (visual EMG signal feedback) to standard exercises in the first weeks after ACL reconstruction led to greater quadriceps EMG output and better knee extension range than exercise alone. Similarly, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is often used alongside exercise to help activate the quadriceps, with evidence that combined NMES and exercise yields stronger quadriceps than exercise alone in the early phase post-ACL. These findings underscore the importance of maximizing muscle activation through innovative rehabilitation strategies during the vulnerable immediate postoperative period. The Knee Extensors Activation (KEA) Device was developed to address the need for objective feedback and standardization in early quadriceps rehabilitation. The KEA device is a novel, portable tool consisting of an inflatable cushion, a hand-held air pump, an integrated pressure gauge, and a digital repetition counter. The inflatable cushion (placed under the patient's knee) provides resistance during isometric contraction, similar to a rolled towel but with adjustable pressure. The built-in pressure gauge displays the pressure inside the cushion, and is equipped with sensor markers that indicate when a full contraction (sufficient pressure threshold) is achieved. When the patient contracts the quadriceps and presses the knee down on the cushion, a pressure indicator moves; reaching the end-range sensor triggers the digital counter to register a successful repetition. The counter only increments when the pressure has risen above a preset threshold (indicating an adequate contraction) and then returns to baseline, ensuring that only correct, full-effort repetitions are counted. By providing visual feedback of pressure and an automatic rep count, the device aims to engage the patient and encourage maximal activation of the quadriceps with each contraction. In doing so, it standardizes the quad set exercise and reduces reliance on the therapist's subjective judgment of effort or on the patient's inconsistent self-monitoring. It's hypothesized that using the KEA device in the first week after ACL reconstruction will result in greater quadriceps muscle activation compared to the conventional rolled towel method. It's further hypothesized that patients using the device will report equal or better early functional outcomes, such as reduced pain and kinesiophobia, due to potentially greater confidence in knee contraction and improved knee extension ability. This paper presents the protocol for a two-arm randomized controlled trial designed to test these hypotheses. The trial's primary objective is to compare the quadriceps muscle EMG amplitude during a maximal contraction on day 5 post-surgery between patients trained with the KEA device versus those performing standard care (towel under knee). Secondary objectives include comparing patient-reported outcomes (knee function, pain, and fear of movement) between the two groups at the end of the intervention. We anticipate that the findings will provide evidence on whether an inexpensive, feedback-enhanced device can improve early ACL rehabilitation outcomes, which could have implications for standard postoperative care. METHODS/DESIGN Study Design and Setting This study is a single-centre, two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) employing parallel groups, conducted at a tertiary-care orthopedic hospital. Participants will be enrolled during their inpatient stay following ACL reconstruction. The study design aligns with SPIRIT guidelines for clinical trial protocols, and reporting will adhere to CONSORT standards. Ethical approval has been bending for review process at the Scientific Research Ethics Committee at Jouf University. All participants will provide informed consent prior to enrollment. Figure 6 illustrates the participant flow from recruitment and eligibility screening through randomization, intervention allocation (KEA device versus rolled towel), and subsequent outcome assessments performed at Day 5 postoperatively. Participants Inclusion criteria involes Adults aged 18-45 years undergoing primary unilateral ACL reconstruction surgery are eligible for the trial. Participants must be within this age range to capture young to middle-aged adults (who are most commonly affected by ACL injuries) and to ensure a relatively homogeneous activity level. They must be undergoing a primary (first-time) ACL reconstruction on one knee (either autograft or allograft, any surgical technique) and be willing and able to participate in postoperative rehabilitation. All participants are required to provide informed consent and comply with the study procedures for the 5-day inpatient intervention and assessments. Exclusion criteria covers patients will be excluded if they have any condition that could confound the rehabilitation or outcomes. This includes those undergoing bilateral knee surgery (simultaneous both knees, which would make the rehabilitation protocol and EMG measures incomparable), any significant neuromuscular disorder or cognitive impairment that would interfere with performing the exercises or following instructions, or any history of major lower limb surgery in the past year (aside from the current ACL surgery) that could affect muscle function (e.g. recent fractures or surgeries on the involved leg). Patients with concomitant ligament injuries requiring additional extensive repair (other than minor meniscal trim or minor collateral ligament repair) may also be excluded to maintain a relatively uniform rehabilitation course. Table 1 summarizes the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sample size would include a target sample of 40 participants (20 per group) has been set. A priori power analysis was performed based on detecting a difference in quadriceps EMG activation between groups at Day 5. We drew on prior research of early quadriceps facilitation: for example, Christanell et al. reported significantly greater vastus medialis EMG output in an EMG-biofeedback group versus controls at 6 weeks post-ACL,5 even with a total sample of 16 patients. Given that finding, we conservatively anticipate a moderate to large effect size for the difference in EMG amplitude at 5 days using the KEA device. Assuming a between-group difference of approximately 15-20% in normalized EMG amplitude (device vs control) with a standard deviation of \~15% (based on variability observed in similar EMG studies),3 we estimate that 16 participants per group would provide 80% power at α=0.05 (two-tailed) to detect a statistically significant difference. Our chosen sample of 20 per group (\~40 total) accounts for potential drop-outs or exclusions. The hospital where the trial is conducted performs a high volume of ACL reconstructions, facilitating recruitment of 40 patients within the planned enrollment period (approximately 6-8 months). Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they cannot complete the intervention due to medical complications or if they request to withdraw; replacements will be recruited until the target sample size is reached. Randomization: After confirming eligibility and obtaining consent, participants will be randomly assigned to either the KEA Device group or the Towel group in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random sequence with random block sizes (to ensure concealment and balance). Allocation will be concealed in opaque sealed envelopes prepared by an independent researcher not involved in patient recruitment or treatment. On the morning of postoperative Day 1 (the day after surgery), the treating physiotherapist will open the envelope to reveal the group assignment. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of participants and treating therapists is not possible, patients will know whether they are using the device or a towel, and therapists must instruct accordingly. However, to minimize bias, the outcome assessor (the physiologist conducting the Day 5 EMG tests and administering questionnaires) will be blinded to group allocation. Participants will be instructed not to reveal which training method they used, and the device or towel will not be present during outcome assessments. Intervention Protocol Both groups will receive a structured quadriceps exercise protocol starting on Postoperative Day 1 (within \~24 hours after surgery) and continuing through Day 5. This corresponds to the typical inpatient period for post-ACL recovery at our institution (patients are kept for intensive physiotherapy and monitoring during the first 5 days). The intervention consists of two supervised exercise sessions per day (morning and afternoon), for a total of 10 sessions over 5 days. Each session focuses on isometric quadriceps contractions (quadriceps setting exercises), performed as 3 sets of 10 repetitions. For each repetition, the patient is instructed to ""tighten your thigh muscle and push the back of your knee down"" as hard as possible, hold the contraction for 5 seconds, then relax for 5 seconds before the next repetition. After 10 repetitions, a longer rest of 1 minute is given before starting the next set. This dosage (3×10 reps, 5 s hold) is consistent with common early-phase ACL rehab protocols 6 and is intended to provide sufficient activation stimulus without fatiguing the freshly operated limb excessively. A physiotherapist will supervise all sessions to ensure proper technique and safety. In this study, the intervention protocol varies primarily in the exercise setup and feedback mechanisms between groups. KEA Device Group participants perform quadriceps setting exercises in a long-sitting position using the patented Knee Extensors Activation (KEA) device. The operated knee rests in approximately 20° flexion over an inflatable cushion secured to a stable 8-shaped base. The cushion is inflated to a comfortable level using a hand pump (Figure 4), allowing pressure adjustment to match the patient's rehabilitation stage. During contraction, the patient presses the knee into the cushion, generating internal pressure that moves a dial indicator on the device's panel-mounted gauge. The gauge has two sensor thresholds-midpoint and end-range-used to assess contraction quality. A digital counter records a repetition only when the pressure reaches the upper sensor and subsequently returns below the midpoint, ensuring a complete contraction-relaxation cycle. This feedback mechanism standardises repetition quality and encourages maximal quadriceps activation (Figures 1-3). During each session, the physiotherapist provides verbal cues, verifies 5-second contraction holds, and monitors progress via the counter. Minimal manual support may be given, but no adjunct devices are used. Between sets, the patient rests and adjusts for comfort. The device is removed post-session. Figure 5 illustrates a typical clinical application of the KEA device. By contrast, the Towel Group (Control) follows the same exercise protocol, three sets of 10 repetitions with 5-second holds, but uses a rolled towel (10-15 cm diameter) under the knee. The patient is instructed to press the knee down onto the towel while the therapist provides verbal feedback and manually counts repetitions. Unlike the KEA group, there is no objective feedback or automated counting. Repetitions are recorded based on visible effort, even if suboptimal, reflecting standard clinical practice. All other elements-frequency, therapist supervision, positioning, and adjunct treatments (e.g. cryotherapy, mobilisation)-are consistent between groups to isolate the effect of feedback and measurement modality. A summary of the intervention protocol for both groups is presented in Table 2. This table outlines the exercise dosage (frequency, sets, reps), duration, and the distinguishing features (use of KEA device vs towel) Outcome Measures All outcome assessments will be conducted on Day 5 postoperatively, immediately following the final intervention session. This time point was selected to capture the acute effects of the 5-day quadriceps training programme. An experienced assessor, blinded to group allocation, will perform all measurements in a clinical rehabilitation setting. Participants will be familiarised with the procedures to ensure consistent and maximal effort. The primary outcome is quadriceps activation, quantified by surface electromyography (EMG) amplitude of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis and vastus lateralis. EMG amplitude, a validated proxy for muscle activation, reflects motor unit recruitment during contraction. Testing will be conducted in long sitting with the knee supported by a rolled towel (identical for both groups to avoid bias). Participants will perform three 5-second maximal isometric contractions, with 30 seconds rest between trials. Standard Ag/AgCl electrodes will be placed per SENIAM guidelines, and signals will be sampled at 1000 Hz with a 20-450 Hz band-pass filter. Root-mean-square (RMS) EMG will be computed over a steady 3-second segment, and the highest amplitude from the three trials will be recorded. Data will be normalised to the contralateral leg's Day 5 activation, assuming symmetrical capability; if unreliable, raw values will be analysed with body mass index as a covariate. A composite activation score may be derived from the mean of the three muscles. This measure enables between-group comparison in voluntary muscle activation. Additional qualitative markers such as knee extension capacity and muscle tremor during contraction will be noted. As quadriceps activation failure is known to impair functional recovery, even early improvements in EMG may hold clinical relevance. Secondary outcomes include knee-specific function, pain and psychological readiness, all assessed on Day 5. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) evaluates pain, symptoms, ADL, sport and quality of life (0-100 per subscale), widely used in ACL populations. We expect limited change by Day 5 but will explore pain and symptom subscales for potential group differences. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) assesses fear of movement, a known barrier in ACL rehabilitation. The TSK may reflect whether real-time feedback from the KEA device influences early confidence. Since early kinesiophobia can hinder recovery, this measure will help evaluate psychological impact. IKDC Subjective Knee Form, a global measure of knee function (0-100), complements KOOS by capturing symptoms and performance.While some sport-related items may be less applicable at this early stage, IKDC still offers insight into initial recovery. Pain will be measured using a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), capturing both average rest pain and peak pain during exercises. As pain can limit muscle recruitment, group comparisons will determine whether the KEA protocol affects perceived discomfort. All questionnaires (KOOS, TSK, IKDC and VAS) will be completed on Day 5 before EMG testing to avoid influence from muscular effort. Responses will be collected electronically or on paper. In cases where data cannot be obtained (e.g. due to language or cognitive limitations), these will be recorded as missing, although such participants are generally excluded. Table 3 provides an overview of all outcomes and their respective instruments. Data Collection and Management Demographic data (age, sex, BMI, activity level, etc.) and surgical details (graft type, any concomitant injuries) will be recorded at baseline from medical records. During the 5-day intervention, therapy logs will document session attendance, any missed reps or issues, and any adverse events (e.g. intense pain, device problems). The digital counter readings from the KEA device group will be noted to verify compliance (each session should have 30 counts if fully completed). In the towel group, therapists will similarly log that 3 sets of 10 were attempted. Any deviations (e.g. patient could only do 2 sets due to fatigue) will be documented. Outcome data on Day 5 will be recorded on case report forms and then entered into a secure database by a data manager blinded to allocation. EMG data will be stored electronically; the EMG signals will be analyzed offline by a blinded analyst who labels the files by code (so as not to know group). We will average the EMG results from the three quadriceps muscles or analyze them separately depending on distribution; primarily, we expect all three to change in the same direction. The database will be checked for errors and locked after entry. We plan to de-identify and share the dataset underlying the results upon publication, in line with open science practices. Statistical Analysis All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, including all participants in the groups to which they were randomized, regardless of adherence (as long as outcome data are available). Descriptive statistics will summarize baseline characteristics by group to check for any chance imbalances (though randomization should prevent systematic differences). The primary outcome (quadriceps EMG amplitude, e.g. % of reference) will be compared between the KEA and Towel groups using an independent-samples t-test if the data are approximately normally distributed. If the distribution is skewed or variances unequal, we will use a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. A repeated-measures or ANCOVA analysis will also be performed if a baseline measure of activation becomes available (for instance, if we consider the contralateral leg as baseline activation, we could use a paired comparison; however, our primary analysis is the between-group comparison at Day 5). Additionally, the three muscles' EMG values may be analyzed using a multivariate approach (MANOVA) to see if there is a consistent group effect across all heads of the quadriceps. For secondary outcomes (KOOS subscales, IKDC, TSK, VAS), group comparisons will similarly be made with t-tests or non-parametric equivalents. Given the exploratory nature of secondary outcomes at this early time point, adjustment for multiple comparisons for these outcomes will not be applied, but the findings will be interpreted cautiously. Categorical variables (if any) will be compared with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Effect sizes (Cohen's d or rank-biserial for non-parametric) will be calculated to quantify the magnitude of differences. A subgroup or exploratory analysis may be conducted to see if outcomes differ by gender or by graft type, though the sample is likely too small to draw firm conclusions on subgroups. No interim analyses are planned due to the short intervention and follow-up duration. Missing data: Minimal missing data is anticipated since the outcome assessment is at day 5 in a controlled setting. If a participant misses the day 5 assessment (e.g. due to early discharge or complication), we will attempt to have them return within 1-2 days for testing. If data remain missing, we will not impute primary outcomes (given short-term, we will likely treat it as missing and only analyze available cases). However, sensitivity analyses using last observation carried forward (not really applicable as no prior measure) or assuming worst-case for missing may be done to ensure results are robust. Safety and Monitoring The intervention (isometric muscle contractions) is low-risk. All patients are routinely prescribed similar exercises after ACL surgery, so no additional risk from participation is expected beyond standard care. Use of the KEA device does not involve electricity or invasive components, and it has been tested for safety (the cushion pressure used is well below any level that could cause harm; the device is sturdy and stable under the knee). Participants will be monitored for any adverse events such as excessive pain, popping sensations, or swelling increases during exercises. If any participant experiences concerning pain or adverse signs, they will pause exercises and if needed withdraw from the intervention (but still be followed for outcome if possible). A Data Safety Monitoring Officer (an independent senior physiotherapist) will periodically review the log of any adverse events. Given the short timeframe, formal interim analysis for efficacy is not applicable, but safety monitoring is continuous. All investigators and therapists will maintain protocol adherence, and any protocol modifications will be communicated to the ethics committee and updated in the trial registry. Discussion Quadriceps weakness and impaired activation continue to present a major challenge during the early stages of ACL rehabilitation.The KEA device introduces a novel solution by delivering real-time feedback and objective monitoring during a foundational exercise, quadriceps setting. To our knowledge, this is the first study to rigorously compare a device-assisted training method with the conventional approach in the immediate postoperative phase. Its randomised controlled design strengthens internal validity by isolating the effect of the feedback mechanism. Both groups follow an identical exercise protocol, enabling direct comparison of EMG amplitude, the primary outcome and mechanistic marker of neuromuscular activation. Measuring EMG on Day 5 allows us to capture early training effects; even modest improvements at this stage could be significant, as conventional rehabilitation often fails to elicit full quadriceps activation weeks after surgery. If the KEA device enhances EMG activation by Day 5, it may indicate early neuromuscular benefit, possibly translating to better strength recovery and earlier functional milestones. However, a lack of between-group difference would suggest either sufficient efficacy of standard care or that a longer intervention duration is required. The short follow-up period is a limitation, and while the study is not designed to assess long-term outcomes, promising findings would warrant future trials with extended observation to explore whether early gains influence 1-3 month recovery trajectories. Although patients are permited to continue exercises after discharge, the unsupervised nature of post-study activity limits conclusions beyond the controlled 5-day period. A further consideration is blinding and expectancy bias. The KEA group may benefit from motivational effects linked to the novelty and feedback of the device. While therapist contact are matched across groups, the study is not sham-controlled. Nevertheless, the EMG outcome-being objective and assessor-blinded, mitigates expectancy bias. We acknowledge the KEA group may be partially ""trained to the test"" due to exposure to biofeedback, but increased EMG implies true physiological activation, not just improved performance. Another factor influencing generalisability is the protocol's reliance on a 5-day inpatient setting, which may not be feasible in all healthcare systems. However, the KEA device is portable and user-friendly, allowing for potential adaptation to outpatient or home settings with appropriate instruction. The feasibility of such remote protocols merits future exploration. The inclusion of early patient-reported outcomes such as KOOS, IKDC, TSK and VAS adds valuable insight. For instance, reduced TSK scores in the KEA group may suggest enhanced confidence from observing feedback, potentially mitigating early kinesiophobia. Since fear of re-injury can hinder long-term adherence, this early psychological signal is clinically relevant. Pain responses will be monitored carefully, although both groups perform low-load exercises. Pressure discomfort with the device can be mitigated by adjusting inflation, and pilot testing indicated good tolerance. Although NMES or cryotherapy are not incorporated, commonly used to reduce AMI, this was intentional to isolate the KEA device's mechanical feedback effect. If proven effective, the device may serve as a low-cost, scalable adjunct or alternative to NMES, especially in low-resource settings. Unlike NMES, the KEA requires active effort, potentially enhancing volitional control and neuromuscular retraining. In summary, this study targets a critical gap in ACL rehabilitation by evaluating whether a simple feedback-based device can facilitate early quadriceps activation. Demonstrating measurable EMG gains within days could support broader adoption of the KEA device and similar technologies, particularly where traditional methods fall short. Conversely, null results would inform current practice and refine future interventions. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and academic conferences, and shared with clinical teams to guide practice. Informal participant feedback will inform device refinement. If validated, the KEA device could be extended beyond ACL recovery, benefiting early rehabilitation in other knee pathologies such as patellar fractures or joint replacements. Additionally, by standardising effort and enabling objective tracking, it holds promise for improving both clinical outcomes and rehabilitation research design. Ultimately, this study will assess whether integrating a real-time feedback tool into early ACL rehab can enhance recovery beyond traditional methods.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT07040384,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07040384,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT07040384&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

However, their effects on return-to-sport (RTS) testing are not well understood in the setting of quadriceps (Quad) or bone-tendon-bone (BTB) autograft ACLR. The purpose was to evaluate the effects of adding LEAP to Quad or BTB autograft ACLR in young athletes, with respect to formal RTS testing outcomes. We hypothesized that the addition of LEAP to Quad or BTB ACLR would result in non-inferior outcomes as compared to isolated ACLR. METHODS: A retrospective case-control analysis was performed of prospectively collected data from 93 patients under the age of 25 undergoing Quad or BTB ACLR from a single surgeon between 2021 and 2023. A control group of isolated ACLR was compared to the study group of ACLR/LEAP (either anterolateral ligament reconstruction [ALLR] or lateral extra-articular tenodesis [LET]). All patients underwent standardized RTS testing at 6 and 9 months post-surgery. The study was powered based on a priori power analysis to assess non-inferiority of the ACL/LEAP group. RESULTS: There were 51 patients (54.8%) in the isolated ACLR group and 42 (45.2%) in the ACLR/LEAP group. The ACL/LEAP group was non-inferior to the isolated ACLR group for the limb symmetry index (LSI) and passing rates for each of the 6- and 9-month RTS tests, as well as psychological readiness, as measured by Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury. There was no significant difference in overall pass rate between the control and ACL/LEAP groups (33% vs. 45.2%, respectively, p = 0.273) at 9 months. Subgroup analysis showed no differences in any outcome variables at 6 or 9 months between ACL/ALLR and ACL/LET.

Comparison of Two Different Rehabilitation Approaches Applied After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,,,,,,6/9/2025,6/9/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2025). Date of Publication: 9 Jan 2025,clinicaltrials.gov,2025,,,,,9-Jan-25,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe anterior cruciate ligament is incumbent upon the stabilization of the knee joint in our body. Consequently, it is also of great importance for athletes since it is seen that injuries in clinics are predominantly monitored in young individuals, who do active sports. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries commonly occur in football players when a secondary task (motor or cognitive) is involved while they are busy with a motor activity. In these processes, a circumstance, in which there becomes a quick landing after a jump or a difficult pass whilst dribbling the ball, can be monitored. In such cases, the subject of preventing these injuries, which may occur in athletes, and making them ready for second tasks after the treatment of the injury, has become a current issue. It is important for individuals who have suffered the injury- to be able to bring the knee joint to its former function at the highest level after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. As a result, the development of novel rehabilitation strategies has been an ongoing focus of research. A prime exemplar of this phenomenon is the implementation of dual-task exercises. Dual-task exercises appear in athletes as motor-cognitive or motor-motor. Athletes' exercising motor-cognitive functions has attracted the attention of researchers in the past period to prevent injuries in sports and has brought a new breath to the academic world. Studies suggest a decrease in cognitive and motor functions in the acute period after injuries. However, observing its long-term effects, they also suggest an increase in the attention parameter, crucial for athletes. In a study examining postural stability in individuals, who underwent an operation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by giving motor-motor or motor-cognitive exercises, it is seen that worse results are obtained in postural stability in individuals, who underwent only anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, in cases -in which eyes were closed and dual motor tasks were given-, more negative results are obtained compared to the open-eyed group. It is associated with a significant decrease in proprioceptive performance in individuals after anterior cruciate ligament injury. Owing to this decrease, postural control decreases, and negative situations arise due to the pathology of the individual. The star balance test is a sensitive test to determine and emerges as an exercise that will correct this negative situation. Post-ACL injury, individuals exhibit significantly lower physical component scores in quality-of-life assessments compared to healthy controls, as reported in books and articles. Moreover, after the ACL reconstruction, a decrease in the mental scores of the individual is seen owing to reasons such as long-term absenteeism from work, rehabilitation, the high costs of the operation, and traumatic occasions. Foam roller, one of the current treatment modalities, is a myofascial release technique. The purpose of the foam roller application is to activate myofascial release by using the athlete's body weight and back-and-forth movement cycle. It has been observed that the usage of foam roller delays the emergence of delayed muscle soreness with myofascial release in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, while also increasing joint range of motion. Despite the widespread utilization of foam rollers in clinical practice, empirical evidence elucidating the underlying mechanisms and clinical efficacy of this modality remains relatively limited. Nevertheless, the factors -which are consequential in the return to pre-injury performance of the athletes- have not been thoroughly scrutinized. For instance, there is no encounter in the literature examining the effects of dual-task exercises on kinesiophobia, ACL-specific quality of life, star balance test evaluation, normal range of motion evaluation, Tegner-Lysholm knee scoring scale. The purpose of the study is to compare two different rehabilitation groups in terms of pain, range of motion, functionality, balance, quality of life, and kinesiophobia in individuals who underwent ACL reconstruction. The first group is the one with a dual-task approach given during walking and balance exercises together with the conventional physiotherapy program. The latter is the one with the same dual-task approach given during walking and balance exercises together, as an extra with a foam roller.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06831279,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06831279,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06831279&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

"The Effect of Cognitive-Based Neuromuscular Exercises on Reaction Time, Joint Position Sense, Proprioceptive Force Sense and Balance in Individuals Who Had Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery",,,,,,6/9/2025,6/9/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2024). Date of Publication: 18 Dec 2024,clinicaltrials.gov,2024,,,,,18-Dec-24,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe aim of this study is to investigate the effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises on increased reaction time, decreased joint position sense, reduced proprioceptive force sense, and balance problems in individuals who have undergone surgery following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. With the results obtained from the study, the investigators aim to provide a different perspective on rehabilitation methods applied after ACL reconstruction and contribute to the literature with objective and evidence-based information regarding the effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises on sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and proprioceptive senses.Detailed DescriptionAnterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common knee injuries, occurring due to both contact and non-contact mechanisms, such as sudden deceleration, changes in direction, or landing after jumping, and leading to disruptions in knee stability and biomechanics. In the United States, it is estimated that there are between 100,000 and 200,000 cases annually, while the global incidence of ACL ruptures approaches 2 million cases per year. Treatment for ACL injuries can be either conservative or surgical. Conservative treatment is considered a viable option for specific populations, such as athletes who do not engage in activities requiring direction changes, individuals with no significant knee instability, and those with lower activity levels. ACL injuries result in quadriceps and hamstring weakness, reduced knee joint proprioception, and impaired balance. To restore the anatomy and biomechanics of the knee, arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is performed to stabilize the knee and prevent secondary injuries, with approximately 30,000 procedures conducted annually in the United Kingdom. Although comprehensive rehabilitation is a critical component of ACL injury management, whether treated conservatively or surgically, there is currently no gold standard rehabilitation approach for such a widespread injury. The type of rehabilitation protocol applied is one of the most significant factors influencing the outcomes of ACL reconstruction. Rehabilitation protocols have evolved substantially over the past few decades, with traditional rehabilitation, accelerated rehabilitation, and criterion-based rehabilitation protocols being the most commonly employed. These protocols aim to enhance muscle strength, improve proprioception, and ensure knee stabilization, with the timing and types of exercises determined by the biological healing and remodeling periods of the graft. Criterion-based rehabilitation protocols, a relatively new approach, aim to provide patient-specific rehabilitation and maximize progress. Developed in 2016 by the Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy (KNGF), this protocol is divided into three phases: early, mid, and late stages. To progress to the next stage, patients must meet specific goals for each phase, which are verified through objective and subjective testing. The effectiveness and quality of early and mid-stage rehabilitation significantly influence long-term outcomes. The goals of early-stage rehabilitation, lasting approximately two months, include reducing effusion, restoring joint range of motion, and minimizing muscle atrophy. During the mid-stage, which extends from the second to the sixth month, the focus shifts to achieving full control of knee extension, restoring 80% of the muscle strength in the operated limb compared to the uninjured side, and regaining jumping ability. This phase includes exercises such as knee flexor and extensor strengthening, closed kinetic chain exercises, functional exercises, balance training, plyometric exercises, and neuromuscular exercises. Neuromuscular control is essential for initiating movement and requires the integration of sensory information from proprioceptive, kinesthetic, visual, and vestibular sources, as well as cortical and spinal motor commands. This control is critical for the effective execution of movement. Recent studies indicate that ACL injuries are not isolated joint damages that merely affect stability and biomechanics but also directly influence neuromuscular control of the knee via mechanoreceptors located within the ACL. These injuries lead to neurophysiological effects on sensorimotor control. Following ACL injuries, these somatosensory changes may result in deficits in postural and motor control, leading to slower lower extremity reaction times. Additionally, nociceptive activity related to pain and swelling, combined with reduced joint position sense and kinesthesia, impairs movement quality. Neuromuscular control impairments, proprioceptive deficits, and disruptions in somatosensory inputs due to damaged mechanoreceptors may persist for 9-12 months, highlighting the need for targeted exercises during the mid-stage rehabilitation. The complex integration of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory inputs, necessary for situational awareness, enhanced alertness, and the ability to select between attentional resources, can promote the development of neurocognitive functions. Cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises aim to improve patients' reaction times, joint position sense, proprioceptive strength, and neurocognitive functions such as balance, while enhancing motor control and knee stability. An example of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises is the Life Kinetik (LK) method, developed by Lutz in Germany in 2007. This method is used to promote neural learning, support neuroplasticity, and reduce neurological symptoms. During these exercises, visual or cognitive tasks are combined with physical activity to train the brain, aiming to enhance concentration, problem-solving skills, reflexes, balance, and coordination. These exercises involve performing multiple complex tasks that require active and continuous thinking during movements. The investigators hypothesize that the complex tasks involved in these exercises may positively influence reaction time, joint position sense, proprioceptive strength, and balance, which are impaired following ACL reconstruction. A review of the literature reveals that studies examining joint position sense, neurocognitive control, and reaction time in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction are limited. Furthermore, research investigating lower extremity reaction or detection time, resulting from disrupted somatosensory inputs after ACL injuries, is also scarce. While studies have been conducted on neuromuscular exercises in ACL rehabilitation programs, no research has been identified focusing on cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises. The lack of a gold standard rehabilitation method for ACL reconstruction in the literature has driven ongoing research into new treatment modalities and their effects. Recently, cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises have emerged as a promising method to enhance cognitive abilities, joint position sense, perceptual strength, and balance. This study is designed to investigate the effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises on reaction time, joint position sense, proprioceptive force sense, and balance disorders observed in patients following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. With the results obtained from this study, the investigators aim to provide a new perspective on rehabilitation approaches in ACL reconstruction, where no gold standard treatment exists, and contribute to the literature with objective and evidence-based data regarding the effects of cognitive-based neuromuscular exercises on sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and proprioceptive senses. Study Population and Sample The study will include individuals of both genders aged 20-40 years. Post-surgical patients will initially undergo an 8-week home-based rehabilitation program, as described by McNeil et al., with weekly monitoring to assess their progress. At the end of the 8th week, patients who meet the criteria for the early phase of a criterion-based rehabilitation approach will be included in the study. These participants will then follow an 8-week rehabilitation program, twice per week, adhering to the mid-phase criterion-based rehabilitation protocol. All rehabilitation sessions will be conducted in-person under the supervision of an experienced physiotherapist. Measurements will be performed before the rehabilitation and at the end of the 8-week program. The sample size was calculated using G\*Power 3.1, and a total of 27 participants were determined with 80% power. Data Collection Tools Demographic data, including age, gender, body weight, height, BMI, alcohol and smoking habits, injured limb, time between injury and surgery, and occupation, will be collected. Pain Measurement: Pain intensity will be assessed using the Numeric Pain Scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain). Lower Extremity Reaction Time Measurement: FITLIGHT Corp, a wireless light-sensor system, will be used to measure reaction time. Participants will deactivate randomly lit sensors using the affected and unaffected lower extremities. Task variations will include cognitive dual tasks (e.g., counting backward by fives) and motor dual tasks (e.g., tossing and catching a ball) to assess dual-task performance. Joint Position Sense: Passive joint position sense will be evaluated using a joint repositioning task at 15° and 45° knee flexion, with measurements taken using the ""Clinometer"" smartphone application. Cognitive and motor tasks will also be incorporated. Proprioceptive Force Sense: Proprioceptive force sense will be assessed using the StabilizerTM biofeedback device. Participants will perform isometric contractions, and differences between targeted and actual force values will be recorded. Cognitive and motor dual tasks will also be included. Static Balance Test: Single-leg stance tests will evaluate static balance under open-eye conditions. Dual-task conditions will include verbal tasks (e.g., naming words starting with specific letters) and motor tasks (e.g., holding a tray with a cup of water). Activity Level: Pre-injury activity levels will be measured using the Tegner Activity Scale, which scores activity from 0 (no activity) to 10 (elite-level competition). IKDC Subjective Knee Form: Knee symptoms, function, and activity levels will be evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function. Treatment Protocol Participants meeting progression criteria will undergo an 8-week mid-phase rehabilitation program (twice weekly). Patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1: Exercises performed without secondary tasks. Group 2: Exercises performed with cognitive or motor dual tasks (e.g., rhythmic counting, reverse spelling, ball manipulation). Example Exercises (Weeks 8-16): Quadriceps and hamstring strengthening exercises, Hip, lumbo-pelvic, and gastrocnemius-soleus strengthening, Closed kinetic chain exercises, Functional exercises (e.g., squats, lunges, leg press), Balance training (e.g., tandem walking, single-leg stance with open and closed eyes). Exercises will include 8-12 repetitions across 3 sets, ensuring optimal loading without over-stressing healing tissues. Pain and swelling will be closely monitored, with exercise intensity adjusted as necessary. Resistance will start at 40-50% of the unaffected limb's capacity and progress to 70-80%, depending on the patient's functional status.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06755398,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06755398,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06755398&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

However, even after completing the rehabilitation programme, some patients may have persistent quadriceps muscle weakness affecting knee function which ultimately leads to a failure in returning to play. Vitamin D has been long recognized for its musculoskeletal effects. Vitamin D deficiency may impair muscle strength recovery after ACLR. Correcting vitamin D levels may improve muscle strength. Methods: This is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation during the post-operative period on quadriceps muscle strength in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-injured patients. Patients aged 18–50 with serum vitamin D < 20 ng/ml, unilateral ACL injury, > 90% deficit in total quadriceps muscle volume on the involved leg compared with uninvolved leg, Tegner score 7 +, and no previous knee injury/surgery will be recruited. To assess patient improvement, we will perform isokinetic and isometric muscle assessments, ultrasound imaging for quadriceps thickness, self-reported outcomes, KT-1000 for knee laxity, biomechanical analysis, and Xtreme CT for bone mineral density. To investigate the effect of vitamin D status on quadriceps strength, blood serum samples will be taken before and after intervention. Discussion: Patients with low vitamin D levels had greater quadriceps fibre cross-sectional area loss and impaired muscle strength recovery after ACL. The proposed study will provide scientific support for using vitamin D supplementation to improve quadriceps strength recovery after ACLR. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05174611.

"Comparison of Conservative Treatment With Blood Flow Restriction With Standard Management in Total ACL Rupture. ""Randomized Clinical Trial""",,,,,,6/9/2025,6/9/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2024). Date of Publication: 30 Nov 2024,clinicaltrials.gov,2024,,,,,30-Nov-24,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe goal of this randomised clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR) in patients with a complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. The main questions it aims to answer are: 1. Does blood flow restriction adds any additional benefits to conservative treatment of the ACL? 2. Does bracing promotes spontaneous healing to the ACL Researchers will compare bracing and BFR to bracing and sham BFR to see if the intervention provides any additional benefits to the conservative management of this injury. Participants will: 1. Use a knee brace for 6 weeks with adjustments according to protocol 2. Follow and identical exercise plan with either BFR (intervention group) or BFR sham (control group) 3. Follow a home based exercise program.Detailed DescriptionMethodological design: For the purposes of the present study, a double-blind, two-arm randomised clinical trial will be conducted. Participants in the intervention group will undergo and exercise protocol with the use of blood flow restriction (BFR). Participants in control group will follow the same exercise protocol but with sham BFR instead. Both groups will follow the same brace protocol. Intervention group: The intervention group will consist of people with a recent ACL tear who meet the eligibility criteria. Participants in this group will follow a splint use protocol. In particular, during the first 3 weeks (phase 1) a splint will be used with the knee immobilised at 90°, non-weight bearing walking with the use of walking aids according to age and mobility. During the 4th and 5th week (phase 2) the range of motion of the splint will be set to 60° to 90° and from 30° to 90° respectively. Walking will remain non-weight bearing. During the 6th week (phase 3) the degree of freedom of the splint will be placed at 0° allowing full flexion but preventing hyperextension of the joint. During this phase, partial bearing is allowed with the use of a walking aid. From the 7th week (phase 4) onwards the splint is removed and walking is done with no loading restrictions. Regarding the exercise program, participants in this group, during phase 1, will perform isometric quadriceps and hamstring contractions guided by a visual stimulus from an electronic hand dynamometer. The exercise parameters will be 75 repetitions divided into 4 sets (30,15,15,15) at 30% of the 1st maximum of the opposite leg. During phase 2, the exercise protocol is maintained as phase 1 with the only differences that the exercises will be performed at 60 degrees too. Additionally, the ""sliding"" exercise will be added where the heel is dragged on the bed causing knee flexion as well as the skateboard sliding exercise from a seated position in the allowed range of motion. Exercise parameters remain the same for all exercises as previous phase. In the 3rd phase, single leg squats up to 45° are added. Exercise parameters remain the same. In the 4th phase, the exercise protocol changes. Subjects start at a stationary bike for 5 minutes (without BFR) and the quadriceps and hamstrings isometrics are replaced with resistance exercises for extension and knee flexion. Sliding and single-leg squats are performed at an increased range of flexion (up to 90°) and climbing a 30cm step is added. All exercise parameters remain the same as in the previous phases. During the last phase (5th) gait retraining on a treadmill for 5 minutes and Y balance exercise is added. Both of these exercises will be performed without BFR. The break between sets will be 30 seconds and between exercises 1 minute. The exercise program of the intervention group will be performed under lower extremity blood flow restriction. Cuff pressure will be reduced during the breaks. The execution speed of the exercises will be 2 seconds of contraction followed by 2 seconds of return. Hold in all isometric exercises will be 3 seconds. Initial measurements will be taken upon enrollment of participants and will include MRI, Lachman test, arthrometer, strength, swelling, Lysholm scale, Tegner scale, pain (Vas), exercise pain (Vas). By the end of 2nd and 4th week, strength, swelling and pain (Vas) will be reassessed. The final measurements will be taken at the end of the intervention period and will include all the measurements taken initially. The participants will be given a home-base exercise program through an electronic platform which will provide the possibility of monitoring their compliance. At the same time, through the platform, the correct execution of the exercises will be ensured as all the exercises will be presented with videos and specific exercise parameters. Control Group: The control group will perform an identical program of splinting, exercises, home exercises and measurements as the intervention group. The blood flow restriction protocol will be performed in an identical manner to the intervention group, with only difference being that variables setting will be set at a control program (sham).",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06727344,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06727344,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06727344&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Purpose: To investigate the effects of an augmented reality (AR)–based, telerehabilitation system in patients after ACLR compared with a brochure-based rehabilitation program in terms of patient-reported outcomes and functional performance measures. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: This was a multicenter, assessor-blinded study. Enrolled participants were allocated randomly to either the intervention group, who underwent AR-based telerehabilitation system, or to the control group, who underwent a brochure-based rehabilitation program with a self-log. Both groups performed the same postoperative rehabilitation exercise protocol. Subjective knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) as the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were a numeric rating scale for pain, the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level, isometric knee strength, range of motion, and the single-leg hop test. The intervention group also completed a satisfaction survey. Follow-up was conducted at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Results: A total of 28 patients were enrolled in each group; 1 patient in the control group was lost to follow-up. Patients in both groups demonstrated improvement on all outcomes over time. There were no significant between-group differences in the IKDC score from baseline to 12 weeks postoperatively. The intervention group saw a greater increase in the relative isometric strength of the quadriceps on the involved limb at 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively (P <.05 for all). No significant group differences were observed in the remaining secondary outcomes.

This is aimed at successful recovery of muscular strength and functional stability. NMES has appeared to be a promising adjuvant modality that might enhance neuromuscular activation and accelerate the recovery process. The main objective of the study is to assess the impact of NMES coupled with a structured therapeutic exercise program on muscle strength, functional outcomes, and overall recovery in patients undergoing postoperative ACL rehabilitation. Methods: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 16 patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, receiving NMES combined with therapeutic exercises, or the control group, receiving therapeutic exercises alone. The intervention lasted 10 weeks, with assessments conducted at baseline and at 10 week. Primary outcomes included quadriceps muscle strength, measured using an isokinetic dynamometer, and knee function, evaluated through Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. Results: the results showed significant improvement in strength of quadriceps and knee function in group receiving NMES and therapeutic exercises as compared to therapeutic alone group with a mean difference of a mean difference of 8.75 (p=0.04) and 5.50 (p=0.047) for quadriceps strength and knee function respectively. Conclusion: NMES is considered to substantially enhance the recovery of muscle strength and function during post-ACL reconstruction rehabilitation programs compared to therapeutic exercises alone.

Exploring Prolonged Arthrogenic Muscle Responses and Associated Factors After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,,,,,,6/5/2025,6/5/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2024). Date of Publication: 17 May 2024,clinicaltrials.gov,2024,,,,,17-May-24,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe goal of this observational study is to explore the significance of subject-reported outcomes and clinical parameters in relation to the occurence of prolonged presence of arthrogenic muscle responses (AMR) in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructed patients. The main questions it aims to answer are: 1. Is there a link between the long-term occurence of AMR in ACL reconstructed patients and the level of kinesiophobia experienced before or after their ACL surgery? We hypothesize that ACL patients with higher levels of kinesiophobia are more likely to exhibit prolonged AMR as an unconscious reaction to protect their affected knee joint. 2. Is the long-term presence of AMR in ACL reconstructed patients linked to their subjective knee function and stability (at certain time points throughout their recovery)? Our hypothesis is that poorer subjective knee function and stability might be associated with the presence of prolonged arthrogenic muscle responses in ACL reconstructed patients. 3. Is the prolonged presence of AMR in ACL reconstructed patients linked to their pain levels (at certain time points throughout their recovery)? Our hypothesis is that ACL patients with higher pre- and/or postsurgical pain levels may exhibit a higher degree of long-lasting AMR. 4. Is the long-term presence of AMR in ACL reconstructed patients linked to clinical parameters such as swelling, isometric quadriceps and hamstrings strength and knee range of motion (at certain time points throughout their recovery)? Our hypothesis is that ACL patients with poorer outcomes in terms of these clinical parameters may be more likely to exhibit prolonged AMR.

PURPOSE: To investigate patient outcomes in patients undergoing HT versus QT ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: After recruitment and randomization, 112 patients (HT = 55; QT = 57) underwent ACLR. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively (6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months), with a range of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), graft laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer; primary outcome variable), active knee flexion and extension range of motion (ROM), peak isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength, and a 6-hop performance battery. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated for strength and hop measures. Secondary procedures, ACL retears, and contralateral ACL tears were reported. RESULTS: All PROMs and knee ROM measures significantly improved (P < .0001), and no other group differences (P > .05) were observed-apart from the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) score, which was significantly better in the HT group at 3 (P = .008), 6 (P = .010), and 12 (P = .014) months. No significant changes were observed in side-to-side laxity from 6 to 24 months (P = .105), and no group differences were observed (P = .487) at 6 (HT mean, 1.2; QT mean, 1.3), 12 (HT mean, 1.1; QT mean, 1.3), and 24 (HT mean, 1.1; QT mean, 1.2) months. While the HT group demonstrated significantly greater (P < .05) quadriceps strength LSIs at 6 and 12 months, the QT group showed significantly greater (P < .05) hamstring strength LSIs at 6, 12, and 24 months. The HT group showed significantly greater (P < .05) LSIs for the single horizontal (6 months), lateral (6 and 12 months), and medial (6 months) hop tests for distance. Up until 24 months, 1 patient (QT at 22 months) had a retear, with 2 contralateral ACL tears (QT at 19 months; HT at 23 months). Secondary procedures included 5 in the HT group (manipulation under anesthesia, notch debridement, meniscal repair, and knee arthroscopy for scar tissue) and 6 in the QT group (notch debridement, meniscal repair, knee arthroscopy for scar tissue, tibial tubercle transfer, and osteochondral autologous transplantation). CONCLUSION: Apart from the ACL-RSI, the 2 autograft groups compared well for PROMs, knee ROM, and laxity.

However, the ideal graft source is still debatable. This study compared hamstring (HT) and bone-free quadriceps (QT) tendon autografts in terms of muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes. Methods: Between June 2018 and December 2019, 46 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of two groups for the ACL reconstruction surgery—the HT autograft group or the QT autograft group. An experienced examiner performed preoperative and postoperative examinations. The HUMAC NORM isokinetic machine (Computer Sports Medicine International-CSMI, 2004) was used to assess flexor and extensor thigh muscle strength. Both groups received the same surgical technique and fixation method. All patients were examined after three, six, nine, and 12 months. The final evaluations were performed at the 24-month follow-up. Patients’ scores on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form and the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale were used to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. The two groups were also compared in terms of postoperative complications and activity levels. Results: The difference between preoperative and postoperative knee flexor peak torques (FPT) was lower in the QT group than in the HT group. The average difference between preoperative and postoperative knee extensor peak torque (EPT) was higher in the QT group than in the HT group. As a result, the HT group had a lower postoperative H/Q ratio (flexor strength normalized to body mass divided by extensor strength normalized to body mass) than the QT group (p < 0.001). The mean IKDC scores for the HT and QT groups were 90.13 ± 6.99 and 87.12 ± 6.61, respectively. The scores of the two groups postoperatively were close, and both groups showed significant improvement. The average graft size in the QT group was significantly greater than that in the HT group. Saphenous nerve palsy was the most common complication in the HT group (22%). Thigh hematomas were observed in two patients in the QT group and required urgent intervention (12%). Conclusion: After ACL reconstruction, we found a significant decrease in strength at the donor sites in both techniques, with similar patient-reported measures and stability outcomes. The H/Q strength ratio was higher in the QT group postoperatively, which may have a protective effect on the reconstructed ligament.

This weakness of quadriceps muscle is a complex neural phenomenon ascribed to arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI). Purpose: The purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in AMI post-ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Methods: A prospective randomized study involving 60 patients with isolated ACL injury above 18 years of age were included. Patients with osteoarthritis knee, multiligament injury, previous knee surgery, and inflammatory knee pathology were excluded from the study. Patients were divided into Groups A and B (n = 30, each). Group A received TENS therapy with exercises and ice packs, whereas Group B received only exercise and ice packs post-ACLR. All patients were assessed subjectively using Visual Analog Scale score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC score for functional outcome pre and postoperatively on day 2, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Objective assessment was done by measuring thigh girth (10 cm above knee joint line) and isometric quadriceps strength (using David Biofeedback Strength Evaluation Machine) pre and postoperatively at day 2, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Results: Pain decreased in both groups at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, but there was significantly lower pain in Group A in comparison to Group B at 1 month (P = 0.003), 3 months (P = 0.001), and 6 months (P ≤ 0.0001). There was no pain at 1 year in both the groups. Lysholm score improved in both groups, but there was statistically significantly better Lysholm score in Group A in comparison to Group B at each follow-up. IKDC score improved in both groups, but the improvement in Group A was significantly higher than Group B at each follow-up. No significant difference in mean thigh girth was observed. Mean quadriceps strength was similar in both groups except at 6 months where Group A was better than Group B (<0.001).

This study aims to assess clinical outcomes and RTS across various surgical methods, such as anatomical single-bundle reconstruction (ASBR), central-axial single-bundle reconstruction (CASBR), and double-bundle reconstruction (DBR). Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted, comprising 191 patients who underwent ACL rupture. These patients were divided into three groups based on the ACL reconstruction techniques they received (ASBR, CASBR, DBR). Over the 2-year follow-up period, the study assessed RTS through four single-hop tests, isokinetic extension tests, and limb asymmetry indices. Postoperative graft status was determined using the signal-to-noise quotient (SNQ), while knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 (IKDC-2000) score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, and degree of knee laxity. A binary logistic regression model was developed to forecast the factors influencing ideal RTS. Results: DBR (67.63%) and CASBR (58.00%) exhibited higher RTS passing rates compared to ASBR (30.39%; χ(2) = 19.57, P <0.05). Quadriceps strength symmetry in the lower limbs was identified as the key determinant of RTS (χ(2) = 17.08, P <0.05). The RTS rate was influenced by SNQs of the graft’s tibial site (odds ratio: 0.544) and quadriceps strength of the reconstructed knee joint at 60°/s (odds ratio: 6.346). Notably, the DBR group showed enhanced knee stability, evidenced by superior results in the Lachman test (χ(2) = 13.49, P <0.01), objective IKDC-2000 (χ(2) = 27.02, P = 0.002), and anterior instability test (χ(2) = 9.46, P <0.01). Furthermore, DBR demonstrated superior clinical outcomes based on the Lysholm score (DBR: 89.57 ± 7.72, CASBR: 83.00 ± 12.71, ASBR: 83.21 ± 11.95; F = 10.452, P <0.01) and IKDC-2000 score (DBR: 90.95 ± 7.00, CASBR: 84.64 ± 12.68, ASBR: 83.63 ± 11.41; F = 11.78, P <0.01). Conclusion: For patients with ACL rupture, more ideal RTS rate and clinical outcomes were shown in the DBR group than in the ASBR and CASBR groups. Autograft status and quadriceps strength are postively related to RTS.

"Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciated Ligament With Quadriceps Tendon Graft With Bone Plug vs Bone Patellar Tendon Bone Graft, a Randomized Clinical Controlled Essay With 2 Years of Follow up",,,,,,6/4/2025,6/4/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2023). Date of Publication: 2 Dec 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,2-Dec-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryBackground: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common orthopedic injuries worldwide. Currently, the use of the bone patellar tendon bone graft (BPTB) technique is considered the gold standard. The use of the quadriceps tendon graft (QT) has gained greater interest in recent years, this because with an adequate technique it is possible to obtain a biomechanically superior graft with fewer adverse events. The objective of this study is to compare the objective and subjective clinical results, as well as the presence or not of adverse events in ACL reconstruction with these 2 types of grafts in the medium term. Materials and methods: Controlled, longitudinal, prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial that will include patients of both sexes, between 15 and 55 years of age, with primary ACL injury who attend the outpatient clinic of the Sports Orthopedics Service. INRLGII arthroscopy between October 2023 and October 2025, prior informed consent. Graft selection will be done randomly 1:1 between bone-tendon-bone (BPTB) graft Vs. quadriceps tendon graft (QT) for ACL reconstruction surgery. The clinical evaluation of the patients Will be done by 2 blinded evaluators, through the objective measurement of KT-1000 and the use of subjective clinical knee scales, both preoperatively and at 3-6-12 and 24 months. The presence or absence of adverse events or complications will be documented during a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests will be used depending on whether the distribution is normal or not, for dependent and independent groups, using the SPSS version 25 statistical program.Detailed DescriptionJUSTIFICATION ACL rupture is one of the most frequent and studied injuries in orthopedic literature. Various short-, medium- and long-term results of ACL reconstruction have been described in the international literature, as well as comparisons between different types of reconstruction techniques, grafts and complications. The vast majority of studies and clinical trials focus on BPTB and hamstrings tendon (HT), the former being considered by multiple authors as the gold standard for the management of these injuries despite its association with high donor site morbidity such as anterior knee pain, pain when kneeling and muscle weakness. With an adequate surgical technique for both graft harvesting and ACL reconstruction, the use of QT as a graft has reported good biomechanical and clinical results and even superior to other grafts. However, despite this, at present a precise justification has not been established that defines the advantages or disadvantages of choosing this graft over other popular techniques, which is why a randomized study was carried out in a center of high specialty and concentration of patients with this type of lesions will increase the level of scientific validation of the information available regarding the use of this graft. PROBLEM STATEMENT Is there a statistically significant difference between both techniques (BPTB and QT) at 2 years? Minimum follow-up regarding clinical evolution measured with IKDC, objective stability measured by KT-1000, and adverse events in primary ACL reconstruction? HYPOTHESIS In patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury who undergo surgery reconstruction with the use of autologous quadriceps tendon with bone plug (QT) or bone patellar tendon bone (BPTB) graft, there will be no statistically significant difference between them, in the first 2 years of follow-up, in terms of clinical evolution measured by the International subjective scale Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), nor objective stability measured by arthrometry with the KT1000 device; In addition, there will be fewer adverse events in patients in whom quadriceps tendon graft (QT) was used compared to bone patellar tendon bone graft (BPTB). GENERAL OBJECTIVE Observe if there is a statistically significant difference between both QT and BPTB grafts in terms of clinical evolution measured by IKDC, and objective stability measured by KT-1000, as well as reporting adverse events in both groups at 2 years of follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS Controlled, longitudinal, prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial that will include patients from the Luis Guillermo Ibarra-Ibarra National Rehabilitation Institute (INRLGII) of the Sports Orthopedics and Arthroscopy service, with primary ACL injury who undergo surgery with a consistent procedure in ACL reconstruction either with the use of bone patellar tendon bone graft or quadriceps tendon with bone pad in the period from October 2023 to October 2025. When a patient who requires ACL reconstruction surgery is scheduled in our service, if he meets With the inclusion criteria, you will be invited to participate in the study and if you accept and give your written informed consent you will be included in the study. The selection of the graft to be used will be carried out randomly with a box with a closed envelope, which contains the same number of envelopes with one or another type of graft, and the resulting option will be the way in which the type of graft is assigned. graft, which will not be disclosed to the patient during the period of the study. During the surgical procedure, the repair of concomitant injuries (meniscal or chondral) will be carried out, and at the end of the surgery, the surgeon will prepare the surgical report sheet detailing the findings found and the characteristics of the graft used in terms of thickness, length , and the presence or absence of incidents during surgery. Subjective clinical scales from IKDC, Kujala, Lysholm, Tegner, and KOOS will be applied. Measurement of the anterior translation of the tibia will be performed objectively with the use of the KT-1000 device. Subjective and objective clinical evaluations with KT-1000 will be carried out preoperatively and postoperatively at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months by 2 evaluators who will be blinded to the type of graft used in each patient, for which the anterior part of his knee will be covered with a 20cm long ""micropore"" band, so that the type of graft cannot be identified by the evaluator based on the area of the knee and surgical scar. Clinical follow-up of the patient will also be carried out, in the necessary weeks or months at the discretion of the surgeon or treating doctor, as is usually carried out in the clinical practice of the institute. Non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies will be performed to evaluate the integrity of the ACL graft, by an orthopedic evaluator with experience in musculoskeletal imaging, blinded to the type of graft used, to classify it as: intact graft, graft with partial injury to its fibers or graft with complete injury to its fibers. Knee radiographs will also be performed (AP projection in standing position, lateral at 30° of flexion and axial of the patella at 40°), preoperatively and 12 and 24 months after surgery, which will be evaluated by an orthopedic evaluator with experience in musculoskeletal imaging. , blinded to the type of graft used, to evaluate the presence or absence of Osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren \& Lawrence classification, in grades 0 to 4. All patients will be subjected to the same rehabilitation protocol during the first 3-4 months after surgery, as well as follow-up by sports medicine both pre-surgery and from the 3rd to 4th post-surgical month to receive the same muscle strengthening protocol established in our Institute for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction surgery. Keeping a record of the evaluation of preoperative and postoperative quadriceps strength in a standardized and objective manner through isokinetic evaluation with Cybex. The use of a mechanical knee brace locked to the operated on knee will not be required on a routine basis, unless there is some indication of its use by the treating surgeon to protect associated injuries that require it, and in that case the use of It will be for a period of no more than 6 weeks. Patients must perform assisted ambulation with the use of crutches for the first 2 weeks with partial support of the operated leg and will subsequently progress to full support, as long as there is no contraindication on the part of the treating surgeon in relation to the management of associated injuries. The presence or absence of adverse events or complications will be documented during 2 years of minimal monitoring. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests will be used depending on whether the case has a normal distribution or not, for dependent and independent groups, of the related variables that are the result of periodic evaluations (3, 6, 12 and 24 months) of the same technique. either QT or BPTB, using the SPSS statistical program version 25.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT06189573,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06189573,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT06189573&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Recently, the quadriceps tendon has been considered as a graft choice for primary ACL reconstruction due to its reliable graft size and resistance to rupture. The available literature comparing Quadriceps and Hamstring autografts in ACL reconstruction is limited. Therefore, the present study was conducted to compare the functional outcomes of these autografts using suspensory fixation at the femoral and tibial sites. Aim: To compare the functional outcomes of quadriceps tendon versus hamstring tendon autografts for primary ACL reconstruction. Materials and Methods: A randomised controlled study was conducted at Department of Orthopaedics, BLDE’s Shri BM Patil Medical College and Research Centre, Vijayapur, Karnataka, India, from January 2021 to April 2023. Thirty-four patients were included in the study and randomised into two groups: one group was operated with a quadriceps tendon graft, and the other group used a hamstring tendon autograft. Both groups underwent surgery using suspensory fixation, and postoperative rehabilitation was similar. Functional outcomes (assessed using Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores), return to preinjury activity, and complications were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare pre- and postoperative functional outcomes (Lysholm and IKDC scores) at 6, 12, and 24 months, with a significance level of p<0.05. Results: Out of 34 patients, 27 (79%) were male and 7 (21%) were female. The follow-up period ranged from a minimum of 24 months to a maximum of 26 months. The mean Lysholm score in the hamstring group increased from 47 preoperatively to 92 at six months postoperatively, while in the quadriceps group, it increased from 46 preoperatively to 90 at six months postoperatively. The reliability and validity of the IKDC score for the hamstring group also increased from 46 preoperatively to 79 at six months, and for the quadriceps group, it increased from 44 preoperatively to 78 at six months. A total 31 of the cases (91%) returned to their preinjury activity, while 3 patients (9%) (2 from the hamstring group and 1 from the quadriceps group) experienced knee stiffness, which restricted their ability to squat and sit cross-legged. There were no significant differences in Lysholm and IKDC scores between the hamstring and quadriceps tendon autografts at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Patients undergoing single bundle ACL reconstruction have comparable functional outcomes with either hamstring or quadriceps grafts at the end of the 2-year follow-up period, with no specific graft site complications.

Reduced Knee Flexion Strength 18 Years After ACL Reconstruction in Hamstring Group,,,,,,5/22/2025,5/22/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2023). Date of Publication: 17 Apr 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,17-Apr-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryBackground: Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) and a double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (hamstring group) graft are commonly used for ACL reconstruction. Short-term and mid-term studies show little to no significant difference between the two groups, and there are a few long term studies to compare results between the two grafts. Purpose: To compare the results after using either BPTB grafts or hamstring grafts 18 years after ACL reconstruction. Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence II. Methods: 114 patients with ACL rupture between 2001 and 2004 were randomized to reconstruction with either BPTB graft or a hamstring graft. Patients were operated at four major hospitals. The 18-year follow-up evaluation included isokinetic testing of muscle strength, patient-reported outcome measures, clinical knee examination and an assessment of radiological osteoarthritis using the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. Hypothesis:Hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the long-term outcome between the two groups, as well hypothesis of no difference in patients with prosthesis after ACL reconstruction, arthrosis difference in operated knees and the rate of graft failure between the two groups. Previous follow-up studies showed a significant difference in total flexion work between the two groups, so detecting a persistent difference between the groups will be point of interest.Detailed DescriptionIntroduction Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common soft-tissue knee injury, and has increased in number over the last twenty years. Reconstructing the ligament may be important for maintaining the stability and preventing further damaging of the knee. The two most commonly used grafts in reconstructions are the autologous patellar tendon grafts and hamstring tendon grafts There is yet to be a universally established agreement regarding which reconstruction method of an ACL is preferred. The method using the central third of the patellar tendon with proximal and distal bone blocks as the replacement has been used since the late 80s and is well documented with good results. When the technique using the hamstring tendon grafts was introduced, its popularity increased. Arguments favoring each of the methods depend on which variables one values the most. In some studies, the patellar tendon group reported problems regarding anterior knee pain and decreased sensitivity of the knee, whereas for the hamstring tendon group there was reported increased weakness of the hamstring muscles and knee laxity. However, the overall assessment and satisfaction in multiple short-term/semi-long studies have shown little to no difference . The aim of this prospective randomized multicenter study is to compare the use of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts and double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (DLSG) grafts for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, 17-20 years after the surgery. The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant differences at this long-term follow-up evaluation between the two methods. Method and material of the first study- Drogset et al. recruited 115 patients with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in the period of 2001-2004, and randomized them to either reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts fixed with metal interference screw graft, or double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (DLSG) grafts fixed with Bone Mulch Screws and WasherLoc Screws. The surgeries were performed at four different hospitals. After one and two years, the patients were examined by an independent observer, using a series of objective tests, as well as recording the patients' subjective opinion of their knee function. The subjective tests used were Tegner's activity score, Lysholm's functional score and Modified Cincinnati Score. The objective tests used were Lachmann's test, pivot shift and KT-1000, as well as Cybex and Biodex to measure muscle strength. Method and material- The present study is a long-term follow-up of a prospective randomized multicenter study. The patient recorded outcome scores will be Tegner's activity score, Lysholms's functional score and the Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The examinations include Lachmann's test, pivot shift and KT-1000. We also plan to include radiographs to evaluate the degree of arthrosis 17-20 years after the surgery, and Cybex or Biodex to examine the hamstring and quadriceps strength. The radiographic positioning will be knee AP weight-bearing standing bilateral and lateral view, as well as skyline projection. The Kellgren-Lawrence classification will be used to assess the degree of osteoarthritis. Even though 115 patients were included in the original study, we will only attempt to contact 114 due to lost inclusion-papers between the 2-year and 7-year follow-up \[8\]. During the spring of 2022, the patients will receive an invite to participate in the follow-up study. Following this, patients will be contacted to uncover different circumstances that might exclude certain patients from the clinical assessment. This includes revision of the reconstruction in question, total knee replacement or total knee arthroplasty, and if the knee had been injured beforehand. The clinical examination will be carried out by both a medical student and an experienced orthopedic surgeon. Hopefully all the patients will be examined over the course of two days at each location, and if needed, the rest will be examined at a later date. Hypothesis- Current hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the long-term outcome between the two groups. However, it will be interesting to see how many patients have received a prosthesis, and how many patients struggle with arthrosis. As the previous follow-up studies showed a significant difference in total flexion work between the two groups, we will be interested in detecting a persistent difference between the groups. Another interesting aspect will be the rate of graft failure between the two groups. Feasibility- The strength of the study is the randomization and the long follow-up period of 17-20 years. The possible limitations are the fact that there may be a problem recruiting enough patients to the follow-up, and that it might not be able to get x-rays of the patients at the different hospitals, as this is a matter of cost and availability. In addition, the different hospitals may not have a Biodex available. Publicity plan- The goal for the paper is to be published in an international journal and probably be presented at conferences. For article, that hopefully will be published in journals, Marko Popovic will stand as first author, and Julie Holen and Julie Myhre as contributing authors. Jon Olav Drogset will be listed last, as the main supervisor. Ethics- The REK-application was submitted on the 24th of December 2021. Application number: 391796. Additionally, the project will be reported to NSD when the REK-application is approved.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05876013,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05876013,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05876013&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Quadriceps Tendon Bone Autograft,,,,,,5/6/2025,5/6/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2023). Date of Publication: 4 Jan 2023,clinicaltrials.gov,2023,,,,,4-Jan-23,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament injuries are one of the most common sports knee injuries. Their effect on the knee joint can be detrimental with patients experiencing instability and progressive damage of the intraarticular structures. Therefore, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is often indicated. Multiple graft option exist, including autograft, allograft and xenograft tissues, with autografts being considered as a first-choice source of reconstructed ligament in most cases. Two most common harvested autografts are hamstring tendons (semitendinosus or semitendinosus and gracilis tendons; ST or STG) and patellar tendon with two bone blocks (bone - patellar tendon - bone; BPTB). However, in the recent literature there is an increasing trend towards use of quadriceps tendon autograft (QT). Multiple techniques of harvesting this graft were described, including both partial and complete thickness of the tendon. Another issue is whether bone block from the upper pole of the patella is harvested along with the soft tissues (quadriceps tendon bone graft, QTB). The aim of this study is to add to the body of knowledge concerning full-thickness quadriceps tendon-bone autograft (QTB) used in ACLR.

Quadriceps muscle strength is one of the key determinants for a patient’s successful return-to-play after ACLR. Quadriceps muscle atrophy can persist beyond the completion of the rehabilitation program in almost half the patients and the reason behind this is still unknown. There are emerging evidences showing that pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) can modulate mitochondrial activities for muscle gain. PEMF exposure on top of regular exercise training may promote muscle regeneration and tissue healing. Methods: This is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of PEMF treatment during the postoperative period on quadriceps muscle strength in ACL injured patient. Adult patients (aged 18–30) with a unilateral ACL injury, total quadriceps muscle volume is equal or more than 7% deficit on involved leg compared with uninvolved leg, sporting injury with a Tegner score of 7+, and both knees without a history of injury/prior surgery will be recruited. To estimate the improvement of patients, isokinetic muscle assessment, ultrasound imaging and MRI for quadriceps muscle thickness, self-reported outcomes with questionnaires, KT-1000 for knee laxity and biomechanical analysis, and Xtreme CT for bone mineral density will be performed. To investigate the mechanism of PEMF therapy on increasing quadriceps strength, samples of blood serum will be drawn before and after intervention. Discussion: This is the first trial evaluating the effects of PEMF on quadriceps muscle recovery after ACLR. The proposed study addresses a huge research gap by evaluating practical use of PEMF as part of rehabilitation. The proposed study will provide much needed scientific support in the use of this noninvasive treatment modality to facilitate recovery of quadriceps strength after PEMF.

Use of Nordic Hamstring Exercise to Improve Hamstrings Function in Patients After ACL Reconstruction,,,,,,5/31/2025,5/31/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2022). Date of Publication: 2 Nov 2022,clinicaltrials.gov,2022,,,,,2-Nov-22,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries constitute a significant portion of major knee joint injuries sustained by young, active individuals, and significantly increase risk for long-term disability. Yet the recommended solution to restore joint stability following injury--ACL reconstruction (ACLR)--does not prevent post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis (PTOA). Post-traumatic quadriceps (dys)function is a hallmark characteristic following ACLR, reported to accelerate the onset of PTOA after ACL injury, making the recovery of muscle function a primary concern to clinicians. However, hamstrings muscle function is drastically underrepresented relative to the quadriceps in the context of recovery from ACLR, which impedes the ability to develop targeted treatment approaches. Persistent hamstrings weakness is widely reported in patients who undergo ACLR with a hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, which increases ACL strain, and may contribute to higher graft failure rates in this population. To effectively treat muscular impairments, underlying neuromuscular adaptations known to occur in response to ACLR must be targeted. Eccentric exercise is uniquely suited to enhance neuromuscular function. The Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) is a specific form of eccentric exercise that is clinically relevant and easy to implement, but has not been explored as an intervention for hamstrings neuromuscular dysfunction in patients who undergo ACLR with HT. To establish an evidence-based treatment model, the investigators will use a single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial to establish the feasibility and efficacy of a 4-week NHE protocol in patients who undergo ACLR with HT. Separate factorial ANOVAs will be used to assess the effects of group (NHE, control) and time (baseline, 4 weeks) on selected outcomes. Effect sizes will be calculated for within- and between-group comparisons. The investigators expect to observe improvements in hamstrings neuromuscular function following the NHE protocol, and that those improvements will be greater than the control group. Additionally, the investigators expect the protocol to be feasible in terms of intervention adherence and patient retention. This study will identify specific barriers to the implementation of NHE in patients who undergo ACLR with HT, and will provide support for the application of an easy to implement clinical intervention able to address a complex neurophysiological problem.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05738200,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05738200,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05738200&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

To date, there has only be one completed randomized controlled trial with quad tendon to BTB and the tendon included a bone plug. There has been no study to date comparing an all soft tissue quad tendon to patellar tendon in a randomized controlled trial for ACL reconstruction.Detailed DescriptionPatients will be recruited from the PI's population base at Highlands Sports Medicine Clinic. Patients in need of an ACL reconstruction will be asked if they are interested in participating in a study comparing BTB and QT autografts by the PI (Dr. Amit Momaya). The benefits and risks of each graft choice will be thoroughly explained. Both graft options are considered equally appropriate management. Interested patients will be screened for eligibility criteria by a research assistant; those matching eligibility will be consented and enrolled in person at the time of the visit. Patients will be randomized per trial arm assignment to either (i) assignment ""0"" or (ii) assignment ""1"". To ensure randomization, a random number generator is used to assign patient numbers and study groups; these assignments are placed with consent information to remain blinded to research personnel and participants until the consent and enrollment process. We anticipate fifty participants per assignment and oen-hundred participants in total. Assignment 0 represents the BTB group. This procedure harvests the patient's middle third of the patella tendon through a single incision for the new ACL graft. When the graft is in place, the graft is secured using a surgical button at the femoral end and a non-absorbable screw at the tibial end. Assignment 1 represents the QT group. This procedure harvests the patient's quadricep tendon through a single incision then utilizes surgical buttons to fix the graft at the tibial and femoral ends. Following enrollment, patients will immediately be notified of their assignment. Patients will also complete KT-1000 manual maximum side-to-side difference measurements . The patient will then be scheduled for ACL reconstruction surgery according to their assignment. Following reconstruction, standard of care rehabilitation and mobility instructions will be provided.

Normalization of Gait After ACL Reconstruction: A Comparative Study Between Home-based Versus Standardized Therapy,,,,,,6/3/2025,6/3/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2022). Date of Publication: 20 Jun 2022,clinicaltrials.gov,2022,,,,,20-Jun-22,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe objective of this study is to evaluate the regaining of a normal gait within the early rehabilitation (12-13 weeks postsurgical) after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Therefore, two different rehabilitation programs (supervised versus home-based) will be compared. A prospective, parallel-grouped trial with patients´ free choice of postsurgical therapy (home based versus supervised) will be conducted. One group will receive a well supervised, standardized rehabilitation program, while the other group will be instructed in a home-based rehabilitation program. Gait assessments will be carried out 6-7 weeks and 12-13 weeks postsurgical using standard 3D clinical gait analysis. Complementary, gait will also be evaluated using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) three times postsurgical (6-7 weeks, 9-10 weeks, 12-13 weeks). Furthermore, various clinical parameters, like patient reported outcome measures (PROM), knee swelling, range of motion (ROM) will be taken presurgical as well as on days of gait assessment. The study will show the impact of physiotherapeutic therapy on the early normalization of gait after ACL reconstruction. The results may help to build a better understanding of the required physiotherapeutic supervision after ACL surgery and if a home-based therapy can safely be recommended to specific patients.Detailed DescriptionDesign: The study is designed as a prospective, parallel-grouped trial. The patient will have the free choice out of two postsurgical rehabilitation regimens. The baseline assessments will take place presurgical after the official enrolment procedure. After surgery, three follow ups are set (6-7, 9-10, 12-13 weeks postsurgical). 3D gait analysis will be performed on first and third series. Additionally, IMU gait analysis as well as the modified Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) will be performed . Furthermore, various clinical parameters, like patient reported outcome measures (PROM), knee swelling, range of motion (ROM) will be taken on assessment days. Enrolment/Allocation/Blinding: An appointment for checking eligibility will be made presurgical. If the patient is eligible, a signed informed consent will be collected and a continuous identification number will be defined by a central study coordinator. Further, the general personal data will be assessed, and presurgical measurements (e.g. ROM, knee swelling, PROM, height, weight) will be performed. After surgery the patients can choose between a standardized rehabilitation program at the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at University Hospital Krems (UHK) or a supervised home-based program. A blinding of the patients is not possible, due to the nature of the study and the obviosity of group allocation. The principal investigator will be blinded to the allocation and will only get access to the coding list in special cases (e.g. harm). Furthermore, the principal investigator is not involved in the statistical analysis of data. Rehabilitation programs: Therapy Focus (both Groups): Stationary setting: Reduction of swelling, gait training with crutches, introduction to a CPM (continuous passive motion) machine, instruction to exercises for home practice (active flexion and extension), stretching of ischiocrural muscles and M. iliopsoas From 2nd week postsurgical: Mobilisation of the patella, mobilisation of scars, gait training (beginning with partial weight-bearing), improvement of range of motion, progression of soft strengthening of knee flexion and extension.

Training diaries: Patients of both rehabilitation programs will be encouraged to keep training diaries to monitor progression in load increase, repetitions of exercises and frequency in the period of home training. Additional treatments shall also be documented (e.g. surge current). The diaries between the groups differ, as the standard-group will receive only one general sheet to document their training for the whole study period, while the home-based group will receive an extra sheet for every phase (5 documents), where all exercises can be selected separately. Ethical aspects: All participants will be informed about the nature and the scope of the study and will give a written consent. The trial has been registered and received an ethical approval of the Committee for Scientific Integrity and Ethics of the Karl Landsteiner University Krems. The registration number is 1038/2019. Participants may withdraw from the study anytime, without giving a specific reason. Furthermore, if a participant may take obvious physiological harm by staying within the study protocol, the principal investigator can decide to remove him/her from the study. Sample size calculation and statistical procedures: For the statistical analysis a matched pair t-test will be used. The matching criteria will be the Tegner score (maximum one point difference) and the age of the participants (maximum five years difference). The required number of patients was calculated beforehand using the software nQuery version 8.5. The sample size estimation is based on the primary outcome parameter (step length symmetry) after a literature review. According to the calculation 24 pairs are needed to detect a statistical effect size of 0.6 with a power of 80 percent. Considering the usual drop-out rates and the impossibility of finding matching partners, for estimated a third of the participants, the sample size was set with 45 persons per group.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05481918,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05481918,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05481918&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial from 2018 to 2019. The same preoperative protocol, surgical technique and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. Eighty-eight young adult male patients were randomized, and 44 of each group completed the trial. Results: After the follow up analysis, the contralateral receptor and donor limb demonstrated a statistically significant increase in peak extension torque compared with the ipsilateral operated limb (effect size (ES) = 0.99, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001; ES = 0.46, power = 0.56, P < 0.04). The symmetry between limbs was compared between groups. In the contralateral group, there was a significant decrease in the recipient limb (after surgery), compared with the donor limb (before surgery) (ES = 0.87, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001). In the ipsilateral group, the operated limb demonstrated a significant decrease in peak extension torque compared with the non-operated limb after surgery (ES = 1.88, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001). The comparison between groups in sensory-motor capacity and Lysholm score demonstrated a non-significant group effect postoperatively.

High-level evidence for mid- and long-term results is lacking, whereas outcomes of ACLSR in several historical studies were shown to deteriorate at midterm follow-up after initial good short-term outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: Contemporary ACLSR is noninferior to ACLR in the treatment of acute ACL rupture in terms of patient self-reported outcomes at 5 years postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A total of 48 patients were enrolled in the study and, after stratification and randomization, underwent either dynamic augmented (DA) ACLSR or anatomic single-bundle ACLR. The primary outcome measure was the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 (IKDC) subjective score (IKDCs). Furthermore, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner Activity Scale score (TAS), visual analog scale score for satisfaction (VASs), IKDC physical examination score (IKDCpe), limb symmetry index for quadriceps (LSIq) and hamstrings (LSIh) strength and jump test battery (LSIj), Kellgren-Lawrence grade of osteoarthritis (OA), and rate of adverse events were recorded. Analyses were based on an intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the median IKDCs of the DA ACLSR group (n = 23; 75.9) was lower than the prespecified noninferiority margin (n = 21; 86.6). Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. However, the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the DA ACLSR group (100.0) was higher than the median IKDCs of the ACLR group (96.6), rendering the result for noninferiority inconclusive. No statistical difference was found between groups for median IKDCs (repair, 90.2; reconstruction, 96.6). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were found for any of the secondary outcome measures for the DA ACLSR compared with the ACLR group: KOOS Symptoms, 92.9 versus 96.4; KOOS Pain, 100 versus 97.2; KOOS Activities of Daily Living, 100 versus 100; KOOS Sport and Recreation, 85.0 versus 100; TAS score, 7.0 versus 6.5; VASs, 9.2 versus 8.7; IKDCpe, 81.8% versus 100%; LSIq, ≥91.6 versus ≥88.2; LSIh, ≥95.1 versus ≥90.7; LSIj, ≥94.2 versus ≥97.6; OA grade 0, 90.9% versus 77.8%; clinical ACL failure rate, 20.8% versus 27.2%; and repeat surgery rate, 37.5% versus 20.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: It remains inconclusive whether the effectiveness of DA ACLSR is noninferior to that of ACLR in terms of subjective patient-reported outcomes as measured using the IKDCs. Although DA ACLSR may be a viable treatment option for patients with acute ACL rupture, caution must be exercised when considering this treatment for young, active patients, corresponding to the present study population.",,,,English,English,,35486517,L637902920,10.1177/03635465221090527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03635465221090527,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L637902920&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F03635465221090527&atitle=Acute+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Rupture%3A+Repair+or+Reconstruction%3F+Five-Year+Results+of+a+Randomized+Controlled+Clinical+Trial&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=50&issue=7&spage=1779&epage=1787&aulast=Hoogeslag&aufirst=Roy+A+G&auinit=R.A.G.&aufull=Hoogeslag+R.A.G.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1779-1787&date=2022&auinit1=R&auinitm=A.G.,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"

Limited evidence is available regarding the most effective intervention to achieve symmetry after reconstruction with contralateral bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) graft. Purpose: To verify whether unilateral isotonic resistance exercise is more effective than bilateral exercise for obtaining postoperative functional and muscular strength symmetry between the donor limb and reconstructed limb for patients who received BPTB graft. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 88 patients were randomly divided into a control group (n = 44) and an intervention group (n = 44). All participants performed an 8-week exercise program starting at the beginning of the fourth postoperative month and were evaluated before and after the program. The control group performed bilateral exercises, and the intervention group performed unilateral exercises for the donor limb only (the limb with the greatest disability). The primary outcome was muscle strength (peak torque and hamstrings to quadriceps [H:Q] ratio), and the secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM; goniometry), KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference in anteroposterior knee laxity, and objective (single-leg hop test) and subjective (Lysholm score) functionality. Results: Both groups improved significantly from before to after the exercise program. The improvements were significantly greater in the intervention group regarding peak torque, H:Q ratio, flexion ROM, single-leg hop test, and Lysholm score in the donor limb (P <.001 for all), and the improvements were significantly greater in the control group regarding peak torque and single-leg hop test in the reconstructed limb (P <.001 for both). Comparison between the groups showed significantly increased symmetry regarding peak torque, H:Q ratio, and single-leg hop test in the intervention group compared with the control group (P <.001), with large effect sizes (>0.80) except for the H:Q ratio. Conclusion: Although postoperative, bilateral, isotonic resistance exercise provided better strength gains to the reconstructed limb, unilateral exercise was more effective in obtaining functional and muscle strength between-limb symmetry in patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with contralateral BPTB graft.

Optimizing GRAft SElection for ACL Reconstruction (GRASE-ACL Trial) - a Three-armed Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,6/2/2025,6/2/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2022). Date of Publication: 4 Apr 2022,clinicaltrials.gov,2022,,,,,4-Apr-22,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryPurpose: To investigate the differences between the three most common methods for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), to support the development of the best method for the individual patient. Main research area: ¨ Sports Orthopedic Surgical research. State of the art: Every year in Denmark 2500 patients receive surgical reconstruction surgery to replace a ruptured ACL. Many patients experience a decline in knee function and 4-12% suffer a new ACL rupture within 5 years. According to data from the Danish ACL register, three methods of reconstruction are most prevalent, but with large variation between hospitals. This indicates lack of consensus on optimal surgical procedure. Design: Assessor-blinded randomized controlled study. 150 patients aged 18-40 with ruptured ACL are allocated to reconstruction with tendon(s) harvested from either the semitendinosus and gracilis, or the patella tendon, or the quadriceps tendon. Patient follow-up will be conducted preoperatively and 1, 6, 12, 24 months postoperatively. Primary technologies and outcomes: * Patient-reported knee-joint function, quality of life and donor-site morbidity is obtained with standardized questionnaires. Primary outcome is subjective knee function with the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form (IKDC) * Instrumented analysis of knee-joint coordination and neuromuscular control including 3-D motion capture and electromyography (EMG) during single leg jumps, landings and change-of-direction. Measurement of maximal explosive muscle power in knee extension and flexion. Primary outcome is relative difference between injured and healthy leg in rate of force development (RFD-LSI). * Standard clinical knee examination of range of motion and instrumented examination of knee-joint stability. * Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thigh muscles for examination of muscle morphology. The trial is designed for publication in three primary publications 1. \- Patient reported effect of graft choice in ACL reconstruction 2. \- Biomechanical effect of graft choice in ACL reconstruction 3. \- Clinical effect of graft choice in ACL reconstruction Additional secondary publications are in the pipeline.

The study compares the three most common methods for ACL reconstruction: autograft harvested from the m. quadriceps tendon (QT), the hamstring tendons (ST/Gr), and the patella tendon (BPTB). By applying this 360° scientific approach, it is the hope to improve the possibilities for a much-needed evidence-based and individualized treatment of ACL ruptures. Objectives and hypotheses: • Objective no. 1: The patient-centered perspective To investigate the effect of graft choice on patient-reported questionnaire scores, primarily on the International Knee Documentation Committee Evaluation Form (IKDC). The investigators hypothesize that of all three grafts, the QT graft will result in non-inferior patient reported knee function. * Objective no. 2: The biomechanical perspective To investigate the effect of graft choice on muscle strength and knee joint control. The investigators hypothesize that of all three grafts, the ST/Gr graft will show largest negative effect on explosive muscle strength. * Objective no. 3: The clinical perspective To explore the effect of graft choice on knee stability and surgery complications. * Objective no. 4: The muscle morphological perspective To explore the effect of graft choice on length and cross section area of the hamstring tendons. State-of-the-art: The most common method for ACL reconstruction in Denmark is the use of an autograft to replace the ruptured ACL. The autograft is harvested from either the m. quadriceps tendon (QT), the m. semitendinosus and m. gracilis tendons (hamstrings) (ST/Gr), or the patella tendon with bone plugs (BPTB). The BPTB graft was initially used as standard method. It has the advantages of faster graft incorporation (bone to bone healing), reliable graft size and low risk of graft rupture and knee laxity. It is widely used around the world. In Denmark it accounts for app. 10% of all reconstructions. A number of disadvantages of the BPTB graft have been described in the literature: anterior knee pain, pain from the donor site, extension strength deficits, and decreased knee joint flexion range of motion. Due to these potential morbidity problems of the BPTB graft, there was a shift towards the ST/Gr graft as the preferred choice. Today, the ST/Gr graft is harvested in more than 52% of all ACL reconstructions in Denmark. From a surgeon's perspective, the graft is easy to harvest, time efficient, and leaves smaller scars. The ST/Gr graft is however associated with increased laxity of the knee joint compared to the BPTB graft, and the size of the graft can be a challenge. Also, harvest of the ST/Gr graft is associated with sustained loss of strength, length, and volume of the harvested muscles. This is of concern, as biomechanical research has shown that semitendinosus is essential to stabilize the knee joint and protect the ACL during cutting movements. Finally, recent research indicates higher risk of revision surgery using the ST/Gr graft compared to the BPTB graft. Currently, particularly in Scandinavia, surgeons are reintroducing a third graft, the QT graft. The advantages of the QT graft are large and predictable graft size and acceptable clinical outcomes. A recent study from the Sports Orthopedic Research Center - Copenhagen (SORC-C) at Hvidovre Hospital found no difference in revision rates between the ST/Gr graft and the QT graft in a cohort of more than 400 patients. The QT graft now accounts for app. 10% of all ACL reconstructions in Denmark, but the graft remains a relatively untested method. Methods: Study design and approvals: This is an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial with a three-group parallel design. Patients will be randomized to ACL reconstruction with either BPTB, ST/Gr, or QT graft with a 1:1:1 allocation. Follow-up will be performed 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after reconstruction. The study will adhere to the CONSORT guidelines for reporting of Multi-Arm Parallel-Group Randomized Trials (http://www.consort-statement.org) and is pre-registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. The study is approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee for the Capital Region (Journal-no.: H-19001194) and by the Danish Data Protection Agency (Jr. no. VD-2018-524) Randomization and blinding: Patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment group using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using a randomization schedule of permuted blocks of random sizes. The randomization will be stratified by biological sex and age. The final randomization will be made after arthroscopic assessment of the knee and evaluation according to the in- and exclusion criteria. Outcome assessors are blinded to group allocation. Before each patient visit, tape will be placed on possible scars to hide donor graft site. Given the nature of the intervention, blinding of patients and surgeons is not feasible. Treatment: The procedure is initiated with knee arthroscopy. Ligament lesions, meniscus tear, and cartilage damage are inspected and treated if indicated, and ACL remnants are removed. The BPTB graft is harvested through two 4-5 cm incisions, one on the tibial tuberosity and one on the patella. The middle 10 mm of the patella tendon plus 20-30 mm bone plugs at each end from corresponding tibia and patella is harvested. The ST/Gr graft is harvested through a 4-5 cm incision at the pes anserinus. Both the semitendinosus and the gracilis tendon is identified and harvested. The tendons are prepared and folded to a four-stranded graft with a total diameter of 7-10 mm. The QT graft is harvested through a 4-5 cm incision at the upper pole of the patella. A graft sized 10-12 mm in with and app. 6 mm in depth is harvested from the middle part of the tendon. The femoral tunnel is placed anatomically central in the native footprint of the ACL. The tibia tunnel is also placed anatomically; the center of the tunnel being medially between the eminential spines at the level of the posterior margin of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. The BPTB graft is fixed both proximally and distally with a Milagro screw (DePuy Synthes) or similar . The ST/Gr and QT grafts are fixed proximally with the RIGIDFIX® Curve Cross Pin System (DePuy Synthes) and distally with a Milagro screw (DePuy Synthes) or similar. The patients are referred to rehabilitation according to Danish rehabilitation guidelines following ACL reconstruction. ¨ Statistics: Analysis will be performed with a linear mixed-effects model of the relationships between outcomes and treatment group (BPTB, ST/Gr, and QT graft) and time points (pre-operative, 1-month, 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-up). Fixed effects are time and treatment group, and random effects are patient ID. Sample size: The study includes two primary outcomes, the IKDC score change between treatment groups from pre-operative to 12-months follow-up, and the LSI-RFD between treatment groups at 12-months follow-up. The two outcomes are of different hypotheses and independent. Based on literature, the minimal clinically important difference in IKDC score is approximately 10 points, and the standard deviation on the change in IKDC score from baseline to after ACL reconstruction is approximately 13 points. Based on these assumptions, 37 patients are needed per group (α = 0.05, β = 0.80). A local unpublished pilot study of 10 healthy individuals showed a minimal detectable difference in LSI-RFD of 12% and a standard deviation in the group of 17%. Based on these assumptions, 40 patients are needed per group (α = 0.05, β = 0.80). A total inclusion number of 150 is decided to account for a patient dropout of app. 10%.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05342441,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05342441,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05342441&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

This prospective, randomized controlled trial aims to provide data comparing both grafts regarding the functional outcome. Materials and methods: A two centre trial involving symptomatic patients 18 years of age or older with an anterior cruciate ligament tear was conducted. We randomly assigned 27 patients to quadruple hamstring tendon reconstruction and 24 to quadriceps tendon reconstruction. The patients were evaluated preoperatively, at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-surgery. The primary outcome parameter was the side-to-side knee laxity measured with an arthrometer. Secondary outcomes included results in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm Scores and isokinetic testing of strength in knee extension and flexion. Results: Forty-four patients (86%) completed the 2-year follow-up. There was significantly improved knee stability at all time intervals with no difference between the two study groups. The manual side-to-side displacement improved by 4.7 ± 3.0 mm in patients with hamstring tendon reconstruction and 5.5 ± 2.9 mm in patients with quadriceps tendon reconstruction. In addition, muscle strength and outcome scores (IKDC and Lysholm Score) did not show any differences between the hamstring tendon group and the quadriceps tendon group. Patients in the hamstring tendon group returned to their pre-injury activity level after 95.2 ± 45.5 days while patients in the quadriceps tendon group needed 82.1 ± 45.6 days.

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that patients who underwent bridge-enhanced ACL restoration (BEAR) would have higher levels of psychological readiness to return to sport compared with patients who underwent ACLR. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 100 patients (median age, 17 years; median preoperative Marx activity score, 16) with complete midsubstance ACL injuries were randomized to either the BEAR procedure (n = 65) or autograft ACLR (n = 35 [33 hamstring and 2 bone--patellar tendon—bone]) and underwent surgery within 45 days of injury. Objective, functional, and patient-reported outcomes, including the ACL--Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale, were assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Results: Patients who underwent the BEAR procedure had significantly higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months compared with those who underwent ACLR (71.1 vs 58.2; P =.008); scores were similar at 12 and 24 months. Baseline factors independently predictive of higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months were having a BEAR procedure and participating in level 1 sports prior to injury, explaining 15% of the variability in the scores. Regression analysis of baseline and 6-month outcomes as predictors indicated that the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 6 months explained 45% of the 6-month ACL-RSI variance. Subsequent analysis with IKDC excluded from the model indicated that decreased pain, increased hamstring and quadriceps strength in the surgical limb, and decreased side-to-side difference in anteroposterior knee laxity were significant predictors of a higher ACL-RSI score at 6 months, explaining 34% of the variability in scores. Higher ACL-RSI score at 6 months was associated with earlier clearance to return to sports. Conclusion: Patients who underwent the BEAR procedure had higher ACL-RSI scores at 6 months postoperatively. Better ACL-RSI scores at 6 months were related most strongly to higher IKDC scores at 6 months and were also associated with lower pain levels, better muscle recovery, and less knee laxity at 6 months.

Elastic knee sleeves may be useful adjuncts to rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to determine the immediate and 6-week effects of wearing a knee sleeve on person-reported outcomes and function in participants who had undergone an ACL reconstruction and who had residual self-reported functional limitations. Methods: Individuals with ACL reconstruction in the previous 6 months to 5 years were recruited. Immediate effects of a commercially-available elastic knee sleeve on single-leg horizontal hop distance were explored using a cross-over design. Following this first session, participants were randomised into a Control Group and a Sleeve Group who wore the sleeve for 6 weeks, at least 1 h daily. Outcome measures for the randomised clinical trial (RCT) were the International Knee Documentation Classification Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) score, the single-leg horizontal hop distance, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring peak torque. Linear mixed models were used to determine random effects. Where both limbs were measured at multiple time points, a random measurement occasion effect nested within participant was used. Results: Thirty-four individuals (16 women) with ACL reconstruction completed the cross-over trial. Hop distance for the injured side during the sleeve condition increased by 3.6 % (95 % CI 0.4–6.8 %, p = 0.025). There was no evidence of differential changes between groups for the IKDC-SKF (Sleeve Group n = 15; Control Group n = 16; p = 0.327), or relative improvement in the injured side compared to the uninjured side for the physical performance measures (Sleeve Group n = 12, Control Group n = 12; three-way interaction p = 0.533 [hop distance], 0.381 [quadriceps isokinetic peak torque], and 0.592 [hamstring isokinetic peak torque]). Conclusions: Single-leg hop distance of the ACL reconstructed side improved when wearing a knee sleeve.

Results: After applying HiToP, the analysis showed a statistically significant improvement of muscle torque (p = 0.041, Es = 3.71), knee circumference (p = 0.039, Es = 1.65), thigh circumference (p = 0.049, Es = 1.26), knee extension (p < 0.001, Es = 2.20) in Experimental group compared to the control group. Only the results of the VAS scale did not differ statistically significantly both within a given group and between groups. Conclusions: The results confirm the hypothesis that the use of HiToP in patients after ACLr have a beneficial effect on muscle strength, reduction of joint effusion, muscle mass gain and joint function. The assumption that HiToP significantly reduces pain levels is not supported - the results in both groups are statistically insignificant.

METHODS: Design: randomised controlled trial. N = 44 ACL-reconstruction patients, randomly-allocated into: CE: strength training of the non-operative limb, or CON: sham exercise of upper limb stretching. Each patient underwent standardised ACL rehabilitation, plus 8 weeks of thrice weekly CE or CON, commencing at 2 weeks post surgery. The primary outcome was quadriceps peak force (QPF) of the ACL-reconstructed limb at 10 weeks post surgery. Secondary measures were hamstrings peak force (HPF), rate of force development (RFD) and International Knee Documentation Committee score (IKDC) at 10 and 24 weeks; QPF and hop for distance (HOP) at 24 weeks post surgery. RESULTS: CE significantly attenuated the decline in QPF of the ACL-reconstructed limb at 10 weeks compared to CON (16.6% decrease vs. 32.0%, respectively); that advantage was not retained at 24 weeks. A training effect was observed in the trained limb for HPF and QPF, which was retained at 24 weeks. No significant differences were observed for IKDC, HOP, RFD, or HPF of the reconstructed limb. Inter-limb symmetry (ILS) ranged from 0.78 to 0.89 and was not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSION: High-intensity CE strength training attenuated the post-operative decline in QPF and should be considered in early-phase ACL rehabilitation. ILS data showed good symmetry, but it masked significantly inferior performance between groups and should be used with caution.

Date of Publication: 23 Nov 2021,clinicaltrials.gov,2021,,,,,23-Nov-21,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryIn Hong Kong, over 3000 Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructions (ACLR) are performed each year in order to restore knee function after an ACL injury. The ultimate goal of ACLR is to fulfil the return-to-play (RTP) criteria. Despite successful surgery and a demanding rehabilitation process, some athletes still fail to comply to RTP. For those who achieve RTP, 23% of those who return to their sports would suffer a second ACL injury. Quadriceps muscle strength is one of the key determinants for a patient's successful return- to-play after ACLR. Quadriceps muscle atrophy can persist beyond the completion of the rehabilitation program in almost half the patients and the reason behind this is still unknown. Therefore, there is need to find a more effective way to increase quadriceps strength. There are emerging evidences showing that pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) can modulate mitochondrial activities for muscle gain. PEMF exposure on top of regular exercise training may promote muscle regeneration and tissue healing. This study aims to conduct a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of PEMF treatment during the late postoperative period on quadriceps muscle strength in ACL injured patient. Muscle endurance could only be investigated in late postoperative period. The investigators hypothesize that PEMF treatment is effective to reduce muscle weakness and promote gain in quadriceps muscle strength in ACLR patients. Based on the aim of this study, adult patients (aged 18-30) with a unilateral ACL injury, total quadriceps muscle volume is equal or morn than 7% deficit on involved leg compared with uninvolved leg, sporting injury with a Tegner score of 7+, both knees without a history of injury/prior surgery will be recruited. To estimate the improvement of patients, Isokinetic muscle assessment, ultrasound imaging and MRI for quadriceps muscle thickness, self-reported outcomes with questionnaires, KT-1000 for knee laxity and biomechanical analysis, Xtreme CT for Bone mineral density will be performed. To investigate the mechanism of PEMF therapy on increasing quadriceps strength, samples of blood serum will be draw before and after intervention.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT05184023,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05184023,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT05184023&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

In today's world, due to developing sports industry , the increase in sports traumas of both genders and ages ACL injuries and treatments are given major priority. The success of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction depends on many factors, including the mechanical properties of the graft, positioning of the proper femoral and tibial tunnel, fixation methods and the postoperative rehabilitation. The tendon grafts can be fixed on the femoral side using several fixation devices, including cortical suspension devices, cross pins, and interference screws. Femoral fixation via Cortical button in a suture loop provides the highest primary stability, and therefore, has become increasingly popular among orthopaedic surgeons. Adjustable and fixed Femoral cortical loops are commonly used for femoral fixation. In this sudy we aimed to compare clinical and functional outcomes of three different techniques of suspensory femoral fixation in ACL reconstruction.Detailed DescriptionThis study has been planned as a prospective randomized clinical trial. We used a completely computer-generated list in order to randomize all participants to receive one of two treatments (www.random.org/sequences/). Anterior Cruciate Ligament tear diagnosis will be made by physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. Participants who agree to be enrolled to study will be examined one day prior to surgery. Patients are randomly divided into 3 groups, after tibial fixation of the hamstring autograft, 3 different techniques will be used in the femoral fixation phase. The first group will be without knotting and retensioning the graft. In the second group, The graft will be retensioned after tibial fixation. In the third group femoral loop will be retensioned and knotted after tibial fixation. All the surgeries will be performed by the same senior surgeon experienced in sports medicine surgery under regional anesthesia with patient in supine position. All participants will receive a standard postoperative rehabilitation program starting immediately after surgery with closed chain exercises and quadriceps strengthening and walking. The operated lower extremity won't be placed in a brace and patient allowed for full weight walking with a pair of crutches. Postoperative evaluations will be performed regularly at 12 months postoperatively . To assess knee stability, KT-1000 measurement will be applied to both extremities in each group and clinical scores ( lysholm knee score, IKDC ) will be measured.

Yet, long-term results that compare this procedure with established methods are lacking. The aim of this study was to report and compare long-term results of ACL reconstruction using QTB autografts versus bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) autografts, both anchored using a hardware-free press-fit fixation technique. Materials and methods: 60 athletes (Tegner score ≥6) with primary ACL rupture were prospectively randomized into two groups. 56 patients were evaluated after a mean duration of 12.2 ± 1.9 months (range 10–14) and 43 patients after 10.3 ± 0.2 years (range 10–11). Results: On final follow-up, 90% of patients scored very good and good results in the functional Lysholm score (mean 99 ± 7.1, range 74–100 points). Normal or almost normal IKDC score was reported by 84% of the patients (mean 97 ± 9.5, range 60–100 points). The activity level decreased in the Tegner score from median of 7 before injury to 6 after 10 years. The KT-1000 arthrometer showed a difference in the anterior translation of less than 3 mm (mean 1.0 ± 1.2, range − 1 to 5 mm) in 91% of the patients. Significant degeneration was radiologically detected in one patient per group. No tunnel widening was seen in any patient. Up to 97% of all patients were satisfied with the operative procedure. No significant differences were found in the mentioned parameters between the two groups and also in comparison with the 1-year results. The only significant difference was in the donor site morbidity. Significantly more patients in the BPTB group had complaints during kneeling both at 1 (p < 0.001) and 10 years (p = 0.019). Squatting was also subjectively more problematic in the BPTB group than in the QTB group both after 1 (p = 0.003) and 10 years (p = 0.046). Conclusions: This study shows equally good functional, clinical and radiological long-term results for both hardware-free methods of ACL reconstruction. These results clinically confirm the safety of press-fit anchoring after 10 years. The failure rate in this study was very low, with only one re-rupture in 10 years.

Follow-up was 2 years. METHODS: Patients older than 16 years who underwent primary isolated ACLR included for 1 year until August 2017 were eligible. The primary outcome measures were the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, isokinetic muscle strength recovery, and return to work within 2 years. The study was approved by the ethics committee. RESULTS: Of 66 eligible patients, 60 completed the study and were included, 33 in the 4ST group and 27 in the ST/G group. Mean age was 30.5 ± 8.9 years in the 4ST group and 30.3 ± 8.5 in the ST/G group (n.s.).

Our aim was to investigate the effects of quadriceps tendon autograft (QTB) vs. semitendinosus-gracilis autograft (StG) on thigh muscle strength and functional capacity, and a patient-reported outcome 1 year after ACL-R, and to compare the results to healthy controls. METHODS: ACL-R patients (n = 100) and matched controls (CON, n = 50) were recruited, with patients being randomly assigned to QTB (n = 50) or StG (n = 50) ACL-R. One year after ACL-R, bilateral knee extensor (KE) and flexor (KF) muscle strength (isometric, dynamic, explosive, limb symmetry index [LSI], hamstring:quadriceps ratio [HQ ratio]) were assessed by isokinetic dynamometry, along with functional capacity (single leg hop distance [SHD]) and a patient-reported outcome (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] score). RESULTS: KE muscle strength of the operated leg was lower (9-11%) in QTB vs. StG as was KE LSI, while KF muscle strength was lower (12-17%) in StG vs. QTB as was KF LSI. HQ ratios were lower in StG vs. QTB. Compared with the controls, KE and KF muscle strength were lower in StG (10-22%), while KE muscle strength only was lower in QTB (16-25%). Muscle strength in the StG, QTB, and CON groups was identical in the non-operated leg. While SHD and IKDC did not differ between StG and QTB, SHD in both StG and QTB was lower than CON. The IKDC scores improved significantly 1 year following ACL-R for both graft types. CONCLUSION: One year after ACL-R, muscle strength is affected by autograft type, with StG leading to impairments of KE and KF muscle strength, while QTB results in more pronounced impairments of KE only. Functional capacity and patient-reported outcome were unaffected by autograft type, with the former showing impairment compared to healthy controls.

Blood Flow Restriction Training in the Adolescent Patient: Effects on Muscle Strength and Overall Function Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Surgery,,,,,,5/23/2025,5/23/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2020). Date of Publication: 12 May 2020,clinicaltrials.gov,2020,,,,,12-May-20,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThis is an interventional study that will examine effects of blood flow restriction training (BFRT) in adolescents aged 12-18 after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery (ACLR). The study aims to identify the effect of BFRT on quadriceps muscle strength and the patient's quality of life, and the overall tolerability of BFRT will be examined. Eight physical therapists at four sports medicine physical therapy (PT) sites will oversee all post-operative PT sessions. Subjects allocated to the BFR group will undergo BFRT, while control group will undergo standard-of-care ACLR rehabilitation, 2 days per week for 16 weeks. Measurements of strength, quality of life, and overall function will be completed at regular intervals.Detailed DescriptionBackground: Approximately 100,000 anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLR) are performed yearly, and rates of these surgeries in patients younger than 15 years increased by 924% between 1990 and 2007.1 Persistent strength deficits in quadriceps musculature following ACLR are common, even several months after surgery and despite targeted physical therapy to address atrophy.2 Quadriceps atrophy and weakness are associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (PROs),3 as well as altered movement strategies and increased risk of reinjury.4,6 Approximately 20% of teenagers returning to sports will sustain a second ACL injury in the first two years following their ACLR.5 Regaining neuromuscular activation and strength of the quadriceps muscle safely and efficiently is vital to full recovery, and current post-operative physical therapy regimens have not sufficiently addressed this impairment. Strength training models recommend utilizing high resistance workloads to produce substantial strength gains,7 yet those recovering from orthopedic surgery are unable to tolerate heavy loads.8 Supplementing low-load resistance training with blood flow restriction (BFR-LLT) produces significant muscle hypertrophy and strength gains previously only thought to be achievable with high-load resistance training.9 BFR-LLT uses a tourniquet around the leg (see Appendix 4) to partially occlude venous return and decrease blood supply to the muscle being exercised. The generation of a low-oxygen environment and increases in plasma growth hormone levels has been shown to promote recruitment of motor units, improve neuromuscular activation, and result in muscular hypertrophy and growth.10-13 In adults and the elderly, improvements in quadriceps strength have been reported in up to 19%14 and increased quadriceps cross-sectional area in up to 6-7% compared to controls.15-16 To date there have only been four high-level studies investigating effects of BFR training in patients following ACLR17-20 and limited conclusions can be drawn from these studies due to lack of consistent methodology (variable cuff pressures and treatment frequency). More high-quality research is needed to determine treatment parameters that produce the most optimal results from this intervention in ACLR patients. Additionally, there are no published randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of BFR training on exclusively adolescent patients. All high-quality BFR training research in patients following knee surgery have been conducted in late adolescent, young adult and adult populations.17-21 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the effect of BFR-LLT on quadriceps strength and outcomes in adolescents following ACLR. This study's adolescent-specific focus provides a significant contribution to ACLR research, as younger patients demonstrate higher risk of reinjury.22-24 The results from this preliminary study will ultimately provide data to guide clinicians in optimizing quadriceps strength and utilizing BFR-LLT in younger post-operative ACLR patients. Protocol: This randomized clinical trial is an interdisciplinary project between the CHOA Sports Medicine Physical Therapy department and Children's Physician Group (CPG) Orthopedics. As part of standard-of-care, all patients who plan to undergo ACLR by CPG Orthopedics surgeons are referred for at least one PT visit pre-surgery, at which time baseline strength measurements are obtained by the treating physical therapist. Pre-surgery collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is also standard of care for all patients undergoing ACLR. Skeletally mature male and female adolescents with closed growth plates documented by radiograph who undergo ACLR with quadriceps tendon autograft will be screened by a physical therapist (the PI or co-investigators) using medical notes. If a patient meets criteria and consents, he/she will be enrolled into the study during the first routine-of-care post-surgery PT visit and randomized to undergo standard post-surgery rehabilitation (control group) or standard post-surgery rehabilitation with supplemental BFR-LLT (test group) as demonstrated in Figure 1 and Appendix 1. Participants will be randomized using a computer program that will generate random numbers to assign participants to the test group or the control group. Participants will be asked to complete four PROs throughout the study (Lysholm, Pedi-IKDC, ACL-RSI, and AMCaMP - see Appendix 5.1-5.4). All relevant demographic, physiological, and radiographic data will be collected at the time of enrollment via RedCap, through a secure link. Data will be stored in a password-protected file on a secure Children's server and only the PI, Co-investigators, and research coordinator will have access. Eight physical therapists (all CITI-trained) at four sports medicine PT sites will oversee all post-surgery PT sessions. Participants in the control group will follow a standard post-surgery rehabilitation protocol starting 2-5 days post-surgery and attend two PT visits per week until 16 weeks post-surgery. The test group will follow an identical schedule of PT visits but will have two to three exercises in each session supplemented with BFR treatment using the Delfi Personalized Tourniquet System (PTS). Requirements of BFR treatment are described below. For both groups, each session will last approximately 60 minutes. Each of the exercises performed with BFR will last 5-18 minutes, with total time under occlusion not exceeding 30 minutes per visit. Participants undergoing BFR treatment will wear limb protection sleeves designed to help protect the skin beneath the cuff while the cuff is pressurized. Skin integrity will be monitored pre- and post-treatment at each session. If a study participant reports intolerable pain levels during BFR, the physical therapist will fully deflate the cuff and BFR treatment will cease for that PT session. Any adverse events will be reported to the PI and Co-I's within 24 hours. All required medical assessments will be promptly performed. If a participant is assigned to the test group, BFR intervention will end after 16 weeks post-surgery. Both the test group (BFR-LLT) and the control group will follow standard of care treatment after week 16 post-surgery, including the standard post-intervention functional testing at 24 weeks post-surgery. Participants will be asked to complete PROs periodically throughout the study as listed below under data collection. All physical examination measures and testing listed are standard of care for ACLR rehabilitation patients. Details on the regimen followed by both cohorts during the full 6-month rehabilitation are outlined in Appendix 1. BFR-LLT Treatment Requirements: The BFR-LLT intervention requires participants to follow the two requirements listed below, as the treatment parameter of 80% LOP has been widely recommended as the ideal amount of blood flow occlusion throughout the literature. Participants who do not meet these criteria will be excluded from the study but will continue to receive standard of care for post-surgery ACLR rehabilitation. 1. Tolerate a personalized pressure of 80% of the limb occlusion pressure (LOP) for 100% of all physical therapy visits in which BFR-LLT is utilized. 2. Tolerate BFR-LLT for a minimum of 20 visits over 16 weeks. Data Collection: 1. Demographic data (pre-surgery, which is standard of care) will include age, gender, race/ethnicity, height/weight, physeal status, and assessment of baseline activity level with the Tegner Activity Scale (see Appendix 6) 2. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (see Appendix 5) will include the Pediatric Internal Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi-IKDC, Appendix 5.1), Lysholm Score (Appendix 5.2), ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) confidence assessment (Appendix 5.3) and Adolescent Measure of Confidence and Musculoskeletal Performance (AMCaMP,Appendix 5.4). These PROs are collected pre-surgery as standard of care, but further collection and reassessment of PROs as described in Figure 2 will be unique to study participants. Surveys will be collected and recorded on iPads with direct entry into REDCap and in each participant's confidential EHR on the treatment note from the day the data was collected. All responses will be stored on a secure RedCap server through a secure link and data will be stored in a password-protected file on a secure Children's server. Only the PI and Co-I's will have access to the data.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT04390035,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04390035,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT04390035&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Capio Artro Clinic (Stockholm) has vast experience in ACL surgery using both semitendinosus and quadriceps grafts.Detailed DescriptionThe purpose of the study is to evaluate the quadriceps graft with bone-plug in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACL-R) and compare it with the most common choice of graft, semitendinosus hamstrings graft in ACL-R in athletes with Tegner Activity Scale 7 or higher. Both methods are well-known and continually registered in the Swedish ACL Registry. Both grafts will be compared post operatively as to knee laxity (primary outcome), PROMs, as well as measure graft site morbidity, Return to Sports rate, and the post-operative rehab. At 9 months we will also preform a MRI scan to determine graft maturity. 5-year and 10-year data will also be acquired through the Swedish ACL-registry and Lysholm score and Tegner Activity Level score. At 10-year a plain weight baring X-ray will be preformed to evaluate development of osteoarthritis. The study design is a prospective randomized study with equal groups: Semitendinosus graft (=100) and Quadriceps tendon graft (n=100). According to historical material from Capio Artro Clinic (Stockholm) the following power calculation has been made: Significance lever 5 percent (p=0.05) and power is 80%. The difference between the groups is 1 mm knee laxity with KT-1000 which would give an effect size of 0,44 or less compared to an average effect size (0,50). 85 individuals will be needed in each group in the statistical analysis. Although no stratification for sex will be performed, our aim is to have a balanced representation of sex that reflects the typical patient population for this condition at the clinic, with a distribution of 40% females and 60% males across both groups. Inclusion will continue until we have at least 100 individuals in each group. This means that each group can have more than 100 individuals. Randomization process and study design will be done according to the CONSORT guidelines. Initially, the study was designed to have two primary outcome measures: KT-1000 knee laxity at 6 months and KOOS at 24 months. However, the study is only powered for the first outcome (Knee Laxity measured with KT-1000), therefore KOOS will be followed as a secondary outcome measure.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT04295148,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04295148,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT04295148&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

We compared subjective outcome (primary outcome) and knee stability, donor site morbidity and function (secondary outcomes). METHODS: From 2013 to 2015, we included 99 adults with isolated ACL injuries in the RCT. Fifty patients were randomised to QT grafts and 49 to STG grafts and followed for 2 years. Patient evaluated outcomes were performed by subjective International Knee Documentation Committee, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Kujala and Tegner activity scores. Knee laxity was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer. Donor site morbidity was evaluated by the 'donor site-related functional problems following ACLR score'. One-leg hop test tested limp strength symmetry. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, there was no difference between the two graft groups regarding subjective patient outcome, knee stability and reoperations. Also, at 2 years, donor site symptoms were present in 27% of patients in the QT group and 50% of patients in the STG group. The donor site morbidity score was 14 and 22 for the QT and STG, respectively. Hop test demonstrated lower limp symmetry for QT graft than STG graft of 91% and 97% respectively. CONCLUSION: QT graft for ACLR did not result in inferior subjective outcome compared with STG graft. However, QT graft was associated with lower donor site morbidity than STG grafts but resulted in more quadriceps muscle strength deficiency than hamstring grafts. Both graft types had similar knee stability outcome.

Methods: Between August 2016 and December 2016, forty patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendon were randomly divided into isokinetic group and control group ( n=20). The two groups of patients underwent staged rehabilitation treatment. The isokinetic group replaced the traditional intervention with the corresponding isokinetic strength training from 3 to 6 months after operation, and the traditional rehabilitation intervention was used in the control group. Finally, 12 cases of isokinetic group and 12 cases of control group with complete follow-up were enrolled in study. There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass index, side of injury, the interval between injury and operation, and preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score between the two groups ( P>0.05). The peak torque (PT) of knee extension and flexion and hamstring quadriceps ratio (H/Q) were measured at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and the second-look arthroscopy. The MRI examination was performed at the same time to evaluate graft remodeling. The shape, tension, and degree of vascularization of grafts were observed under arthroscopy. The grafts were harvested and observed by HE staining. Results: The invertal between ACL reconstruction and the second-look arthroscopy was (23.57±3.23) months in isokinetic group and (23.22±3.56) months in control group, showing no significant difference between the two groups ( P>0.05). At the second-look arthroscopy, the IKDC score was 90.45±4.73 in isokinetic group and 89.32±4.54 in control group, showing significant differences when compared with preoperative scores in the two groups ( P<0.05). But there was no significant difference between the two groups ( t=0.868， P=0.404). At 3 months after operation, there was no significant difference in the PT of knee extension and flexion between the two groups ( P>0.05). At 6 months, 12 months, and the second-look arthroscopy, the PT of knee extension and flexion in isokinetic group were higher than those in control group ( P<0.05). The H/Q at 6 months and 12 months were higher in isokinetic group than in control group, and the differences were significant ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in MRI score between the two groups at 3 months, 6 months, and the second-look arthroscopy ( P>0.05). The MRI score at 12 months was significantly higher in isokinetic group than in control group ( P<0.05). At the second-look arthroscopy, there was no significant difference in the arthroscopic score between the two groups ( P>0.05), and the histological score of the isokinetic group was superior to the control group ( P<0.05).

The 2018 International Olympic Committee (IOC) Consensus Statement now outlines the quadriceps tendon as a possible autograft option. However, no Randomised Control Trial (RCT) has examined the efficacy of the quadriceps tendon autograft in primary paediatric ACL reconstruction compared to the historical ""gold-standard"" soft-tissue hamstring autograft in this population. In light of its evidence for favourable outcomes in the adult population, and the (albeit limited) evidence showing safety and promise in the paediatric population, clinical equipoise exists for assessing its impact on outcomes in paediatric patients at the index surgery. This is a parallel, international, multi-centre, blinded randomized controlled trial of 352 skeletally-immature (at the time of injury) patients (ages 10-18 years, inclusive) undergoing primary ACL reconstruction to compare the effect of autograft tendon choice (i.e. hamstring versus soft-tissue quadriceps) on the rates of ACL graft failure, return-to-sport, knee function, pain, health-related quality of life and health utility, psychological factors, range of motion and stability, and any other adverse events at 24 months.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT03896464,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03896464,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03896464&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Saunders,"Purpose: To compare femoral nerve blockade (FNB) versus adductor canal nerve blockade (ACB) for postoperative pain control and quadriceps muscle function in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft. Methods: A randomized therapeutic trial of 90 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft was conducted comparing ACB versus FNB at 24 hours, 2 and 4 weeks, and 6 months postsurgery. Early outcome measures included average pain score and morphine equivalent units (milligrams) consumed, quadriceps surface electromyography, straight leg raise, and ability to ambulate without assistive devices. The 6-month outcome measures included knee range of motion (ROM), isokinetic knee extension peak torque, single-leg squat, and single-leg hop performance. Complications were recorded throughout the study for the development of anterior knee pain, knee extension ROM loss, deep vein thrombosis, and graft failure. Mixed-model analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed using an alpha of.05. Results: Quadriceps surface electromyography deficits were higher for FNB at 24 hours (P <.001) and 2 weeks (P <.001) when compared with the ACB group. There were no between-groups difference for subjective pain (P =.793) or morphine consumption (P =.358) within the first 24 hours of surgery. A higher percentage of patients in the ACB group met the full ambulation criteria at 4 weeks compared with the FNB group (100% vs 84.2%, P <.001). No between-group differences were observed at 6 months; however, the rate of knee extension ROM loss was higher for the FNB group versus the ACB group (21.1% vs 5.0%, P =.026), respectively. Conclusions: ACB was as effective as FNB at providing pain control while eliciting fewer quadriceps muscle activation deficits and fewer postoperative complications.

Although several clinical studies have yielded good short-term results, high-quality evidence is lacking in regard to the effectiveness of this treatment compared with ACL reconstruction. HYPOTHESIS: Dynamic augmented ACL suture repair is at least as effective as anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction for the treatment of acute ACL rupture in terms of patient self-reported outcomes at 2 years postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: After stratification and randomization, 48 patients underwent either dynamic augmented ACL suture repair or ACL reconstruction with a single-bundle, all-inside, semitendinosus technique. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score at 2 years postoperatively was the primary outcome measure. Patient-reported outcomes (IKDC subjective score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Tegner score, visual analog scale for satisfaction), clinical outcomes (IKDC physical examination score, leg symmetry index for the quadriceps, hamstrings strength, and jump test battery), and radiological outcomes as well as adverse events including reruptures were recorded. Analyses were based on an intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The lower limit for the median IKDC subjective score of the repair group (86.2) fell within the prespecified noninferiority margin, confirming noninferiority of dynamic augmented ACL suture repair compared with ACL reconstruction. No statistical difference was found between groups for median IKDC subjective score (repair, 95.4; reconstruction, 94.3). Overall, 2 reruptures (8.7%) occurred in the dynamic ACL suture repair group and 4 reruptures (19.0%) in the ACL reconstruction group; further, 5 repeat surgeries-other than for revision ACL surgery-took place in 4 patients from the dynamic ACL suture repair group (20.8%) and in 3 patients from the ACL reconstruction group (14.3%). CONCLUSION: Dynamic augmented ACL suture repair is not inferior to ACL reconstruction in terms of subjective patient-reported outcomes as measured with the IKDC subjective score 2 years postoperatively. However, for reasons other than revision ACL surgery due to rerupture, a higher number of related adverse events leading to repeat surgery were seen in the dynamic augmented ACL suture repair group within 2 years postoperatively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dynamic augmented ACL suture repair might be a viable treatment option for patients with an acute ACL rupture.

METHODS: Forty-eight patients (age: 29.5 ± 6.8 years, body mass index: 26.1 ± 3.2 kg/m2) who had undergone ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into three groups when they reached four weeks post surgery: (1) concentric CE (n = 16); (2) eccentric CE (n = 16); and (3) control (n = 16). All groups followed the same post-surgical rehabilitation program for their reconstructed limb. Additionally, the two experimental groups followed eight weeks of isokinetic training for the uninjured knee at 60°/s for 3 days per week. Quadriceps maximum voluntary isometric strength (MVIC) was measured during the 4th week (pre-training), 12th week (post training), and 24th week post surgery. The single-leg hop distance and International Knee Documentary Committee (IKDC) scores were also evaluated during the 24th week post surgery. Analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Group-by-time interaction was significant for quadriceps MVICs for reconstructed and healthy limbs (p = 0.02). Quadriceps strength of both knees was greater in concentric and eccentric CE groups compared to control group during the 12th- and 24th weeks post surgery (p < 0.05). Strength gain was 28% and 31% in concentric and eccentric CE groups, respectively, when compared with the control group. Concentric and eccentric CE had similar effects on quadriceps strength recovery (n.s.). IKDC score, and single-leg hop distances were not significantly different among groups (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: Concentric and eccentric quadricep strengthening of healthy limbs in early phases of ACL rehabilitation improved post-surgical quadriceps strength recovery of the reconstructed limb. CE should be integrated into ACL reconstruction rehabilitation, especially in the early rehabilitative phases to restore quadriceps strength.

Date of Publication: 20 Dec 2018,clinicaltrials.gov,2018,,,,,20-Dec-18,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThis study is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial examining the effect of blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy on reducing post-operative quadriceps atrophy in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Following ACLR, patients will undergo a rehabilitation protocol either w/ BFR therapy or sham BFR therapy.Detailed DescriptionPatients will be randomized to either BFR therapy or no BFR therapy. Randomization will be carried out using block randomization with blocks of 6. Those undergoing BFR therapy will have a Delfi Personalized Tourniquet System (PTS) cuff applied to the proximal thigh of their operative leg and inflated to 80% limb occlusive pressure (LOP) calculated by the Delfi PTS device during physical therapy (PT) sessions from day 2 after surgery through day 7 after surgery. Those in the no BFR group will have the Delfi PTS cuff applied to their proximal thigh with inflation of the tourniquet to minimal pressure only. BFR therapy will be administered by health care providers who have undergone training and certification for BFR therapy with the Delfi PTS device. Both groups will undergo the following PT regimen two times daily beginning on the day after the surgical procedure and lasting for 6 weeks post-operatively: * Quad sets = x1 min isometric hold, 30 sec off, 3 sets * Terminal knee extensions = 3x15, 30 sec rest or short arc quads sitting 1 x 30 + 3 x 15, 30 sec rest * Once range of motion (ROM) allows: Bike 10 mins, low to no resistance Each physical therapy visit will last approximately 60 minutes. During that time, there will be a total estimated time of 5-7 minutes during which the tourniquet cuff will be on the thigh, and the tourniquet will be inflated for a similar time period. The tourniquet will inflate for about 1 minute in order to find out the specific pressure for the patient's leg and then will remain inflated until exercises are completed, which should take 4-6 minutes. The cuff will then be deflated and is removed from the leg within about 30 seconds of being deflated. Patients will have MRI performed pre-operatively and at 6 weeks post-operatively with axial cuts to 50% femoral length above joint line. Quadriceps cross-sectional area will be measured by a blinded observer using MRI. Patients will have clinical measurements including thigh girth, Lachman test, knee joint range of motion, and knee joint swelling performed pre-operatively, at post-op day 1, post-op day 14, and 6 weeks post-operatively. All clinical measurements will be performed by a blinded observer. Additionally, patient reported pain level will be obtained at the same timepoints in which clinical measurements are performed using visual analog scale. In order to ensure there are no nerve injuries present in patients prior to undergoing application and inflation of thigh tourniquet, all patients in the study will have single shot adductor and/or sciatic nerve blocks to ensure 24 hour period without nerve block prior to initiation of BFR therapy. Patients included in the study cannot have a nerve block lasting longer than the day of surgery. To ensure no new nerve deficits are present, the patients will undergo a physical examination during morning rounding on post-operative day 1 to assess for new nerve deficits.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT03794570,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03794570,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03794570&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

However, associated quadriceps muscle weakness after FNBs is well described and may occur for up to 6 months postoperatively. The adductor canal block (ACB) has emerged as a viable alternative to the FNB, theoretically causing less quadriceps weakness during the immediate postoperative period, as it bypasses the majority of the motor fibers of the femoral nerve that branch off proximal to the adductor canal. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study sought to identify if a difference in quadriceps strength exists after an ACB or FNB for ACL reconstruction beyond the immediate postoperative period. Beyond the immediate postoperative period, we anticipated no difference in quadriceps strength between patients who received ACBs or FNBs for ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 102 patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction using a variety of graft types were enrolled between November 2015 and April 2016. All patients were randomized to receive an ACB or FNB before surgery, and the surgeon was blinded to the block type. All patients underwent aggressive rehabilitation without functional bracing postoperatively. The time to the first straight-leg raise was reported by the patient. Isokinetic strength testing was performed at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Results: Data for 73 patients were analyzed. There was no significant difference in patient demographics of age, body mass index, sex, or tourniquet time between the FNB (n = 35) and ACB (n = 38) groups. The mean time to the first straight-leg raise was similar, at 13.1 ± 1.0 hours for the FNB group and 15.5 ± 1.2 hours for the ACB group (P =.134). The mean extension torque at 60 deg/s increased significantly for both the ACB (53.7% ± 3.4% to 68.3% ± 2.9%; P =.008) and the FNB (53.3% ± 3.3% to 68.5% ± 4.1%; P =.006) groups from 3 to 6 months postoperatively. There was also no significant difference in mean extension torque at 60 deg/s or 180 deg/s between the FNB and ACB groups at 3 and 6 months. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications (infection, arthrofibrosis, retear) between groups. Conclusion: Although prior studies have shown immediate postoperative benefits of ACBs compared with FNBs, with a faster return of quadriceps strength, in the current study there was no statistically or clinically significant difference in quadriceps strength at 3 and 6 months postoperatively in patients who received ACBs or FNBs for ACL reconstruction.","fentanyl (437-38-7), hydromorphone (466-99-9, 71-68-1), oxycodone (124-90-3, 76-42-6), ropivacaine (84057-95-4)",,ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02604550),English,English,20180706618,,L624184736,10.1177/2325967118797990,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967118797990,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L624184736&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=23259671&id=doi:10.1177%2F2325967118797990&atitle=Quadriceps+Strength+Deficits+After+a+Femoral+Nerve+Block+Versus+Adductor+Canal+Block+for+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction%3A+A+Prospective%2C+Single-Blinded%2C+Randomized+Trial&stitle=Orthop.+J.+Sports+Med.&title=Orthopaedic+Journal+of+Sports+Medicine&volume=6&issue=9&spage=&epage=&aulast=Runner&aufirst=Robert+P.&auinit=R.P.&aufull=Runner+R.P.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2018&auinit1=R&auinitm=P,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Methods: A total of 56 participants were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and placed into two groups: HT or QT. The hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio was the primary end-point measured with a Genu-3 dynamometer. Peak torque, functional assessment (Lysholm knee scoring scale and Cincinnati Knee Rating System), and anteroposterior laxity (KT-2000™ arthrometer) were also assessed. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: The results of the H/Q ratio analysis of the participants over time revealed significant differences at 60, 180, and 300°/s at three, six, and 12 months of follow-up (60°/s: F = 5.3, p = 0.005; 180°/s: F = 5.5, p = 0.004; 300°/s: F = 5.1, p = 0.005). Furthermore, they revealed significant differences at 60°/s, 180°/s, and 300°/s in the participants over time for peak torque in the extensor muscle strength at three and six months of follow-up, with higher values in the hamstring tendon group but not at 12 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences in functional endpoints or arthrometer assessments at 24 months of follow-up. Conclusion: An ACLR with a QT graft showed similar functional results with a better isokinetic H/Q ratio compared to an ACLR with the HT at 12 months of follow-up in soccer players. This higher H/Q ratio observed with the QT could be an advantage of this graft over the HT for an ACLR.",,,,English,English,20180354231,29776815,L2000770155,10.1016/j.knee.2018.03.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2018.03.011,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2000770155&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=18735800&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.knee.2018.03.011&atitle=Strength+recovery+after+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction+with+quadriceps+tendon+versus+hamstring+tendon+autografts+in+soccer+players%3A+A+randomized+controlled+trial&stitle=Knee&title=Knee&volume=25&issue=4&spage=704&epage=714&aulast=Martin-Alguacil&aufirst=Jose+Luis&auinit=J.L.&aufull=Martin-Alguacil+J.L.&coden=KNEEF&isbn=&pages=704-714&date=2018&auinit1=J&auinitm=L,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the effect of a combined, progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise intervention on knee muscle strength, functional capacity and hamstring muscle-tendon morphology in ACL-reconstructed patients with persistent hamstring muscle-strength deficiency compared with controls. Methods/design: The study is designed as a multicenter, parallel-group RCT with balanced randomization (1:1) and blinded outcome assessments (level of evidence: II) and will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT Statement. Fifty ACL-reconstructed patients (hamstring auto-graft) with persistent limb-to-limb knee-flexor muscle-strength asymmetry at 12-24 months' post surgery, will be recruited through outpatient clinics and advertisements. Patients will be randomized to a 12-week progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise group (SNG) with supervised training twice weekly or a control intervention (CON) consisting of a home-based, low-intensity exercise program. Outcome measures include between-group change in maximal isometric knee-flexor strength (primary outcome) and knee-extensor muscle strength, hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratios of the leg that has been operated on and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (secondary outcomes). In addition, several explorative outcomes will be investigated: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), the Tegner Activity Score, rate of force development (RFD) for the knee flexors and extensors, tendon regeneration and potential muscle hypertrophy at graft harvest site evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postural control, kinetic/kinematic gait characteristics and knee-related functional capacity. Discussion: This RCT is designed to investigate the effect of combined, progressive-resistance and neuromuscular exercises on knee-flexor/extensor strength, in the late rehabilitation phase following ACL reconstruction. Reduced hamstring strength represents a potential risk factor for secondary ACL rupture and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis. If deemed effective, the intervention paradigm introduced in this study may help to improve current treatment strategies in ACL-reconstructed patients.

On evaluation of the anteromedial bundles alone, the DB group had greater widening than the SB group. Conclusion: In this study, we have found that the tunnels continue to enlarge after 6 months. However, that has no impact in patients comfort and that did not made any change in our daily routine. On the other hand, we found that the reconstruction of the double-band ligament technique is useless for non-professional athletes.",,,,English,English,20170604066,28840325,L618004586,10.1007/s00402-017-2774-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00402-017-2774-z,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L618004586&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=14343916&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00402-017-2774-z&atitle=Tunnel+widening+after+single-+versus+double-bundle+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+a+randomized+8-year+follow-up+study&stitle=Arch.+Orthop.+Trauma+Surg.&title=Archives+of+Orthopaedic+and+Trauma+Surgery&volume=137&issue=11&spage=1547&epage=1555&aulast=Beyaz&aufirst=S.&auinit=S.&aufull=Beyaz+S.&coden=AOTSE&isbn=&pages=1547-1555&date=2017&auinit1=S&auinitm=,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Interventions beyond standard care may facilitate successful return to preinjury activities and improve functional outcomes. Perturbation training has been used in nonoperative ACL injury and preoperative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation, but has not been examined in postoperative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation, specifically return to sport rehabilitation. Questions/Purposes: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were differences at 1 and 2 years after ACL reconstruction between the male SAP (strengthening, agility, and secondary prevention) and SAP+PERT (SAP protocol with the addition of perturbation training) groups with respect to (1) quadriceps strength and single-legged hop limb symmetry; (2) patient-reported knee outcome scores; (3) the proportion who achieve self-reported normal knee function; and (4) the time from surgery to passing return to sport criteria. Methods: Forty men who had completed ACL reconstruction rehabilitation and met enrollment criteria (3–9 months after ACL reconstruction, > 80% quadriceps strength limb symmetry, no pain, full ROM, minimal effusion) were randomized into the SAP or SAP+PERT groups of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Specialised Post-Operative Return to Sports trial (ACL-SPORTS), a single-blind randomized clinical study of secondary prevention and return to sport. Quadriceps strength, single-legged hopping, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective knee form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)-sports and recreation, and KOOS-quality-of-life subscales were collected 1 and 2 years after surgery by investigators blind to group. Athletes were categorized as having normal or abnormal knee function at each time point based on IKDC score, and the time until athletes passed strict return-to-sport criteria was also recorded. T-tests, chi square tests, and analyses of variance were used to identify differences between the treatment groups over time. Results: There were no differences between groups for quadriceps symmetry (1 year: SAP = 101% ± 14%, SAP+PERT = 101% ± 14%; 2 years: SAP = 103% ± 11%, SAP+PERT = 98% ± 14%; mean differences between groups at 1 year: 0.4 [−9.0 to 9.8], 2 years = 4.5 [−4.3 to 13.1]; mean difference between 1 and 2 years: SAP = −1.0 [−8.6 to 6.6], SAP+PERT = 3.0 [−4.3 to 10.3], p = 0.45) or single-legged hop test limb symmetry. There were no clinically meaningful differences for any patient-reported outcome measures. There was no difference in the proportion of athletes in each group who achieved normal knee function at 1 year (SAP 14 of 19, SAP+PERT 18 of 20, odds ratio 0.31 [0.5–19.0]; p = 0.18); however, the SAP+PERT group had fewer athletes with normal knee function at 2 years (SAP 17 of 17, SAP+PERT 14 of 19, p = 0.03). There were no differences between groups in the time to pass return to sport criteria (SAP = 325 ± 199 days, SAP+PERT = 233 ± 77 days; mean difference 92 [−9 to 192], p = 0.09). Conclusions: This randomized trial found few differences between an ACL rehabilitation program consisting of strengthening, agility, and secondary prevention and one consisting of those elements as well as perturbation training. In the absence of clinically meaningful differences between groups in knee function and self-reported outcomes measures, the results indicate that perturbation training may not contribute additional benefit to the strengthening, agility, and secondary prevention base of the ACL-SPORTS training program.

The participants were randomly assigned to either the Pilates exercise group (n = 24) or the control group (n = 26). The subjects in the Pilates exercise group performed basic mat exercises that focused on the muscle strength and flexibility of the lower limbs and core muscles during each class session, which met three times per week for 12 weeks. The control group did not receive any treatment or home exercise programme. All patients were evaluated using the Lysholm Knee Scale, the Cincinnati Knee Rating System, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring strength. Patient satisfaction regarding improvement in knee stability was assessed using the Global Rating of Change scale.RESULTS: The Pilates group experienced significant improvement over the control group as measured by the difference in quadriceps strength at 12 weeks (p = 0.03). Both groups showed some clinical change over time, but the Pilates group improved for all outcome measurements at the 12-week follow-up, and the control group only improved for functional outcomes. Patient satisfaction with the level of knee stability based on the Global Rating of Change scale was higher in the Pilates group than in the control group.CONCLUSION: Although both groups exhibited improvements in knee strength and functional outcomes, the results suggest that Pilates is a superior management approach over a control treatment for increasing quadriceps strength in participants with partial ACL injury. Pilates may provide clinicians a novel option when choosing a treatment for a partial ACL injury.

"Graft Selection in Anatomic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: Patella, Hamstrings or Quadriceps Tendon Autograft",,,,,,5/16/2025,5/16/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2017). Date of Publication: 23 Feb 2017,clinicaltrials.gov,2017,,,,,23-Feb-17,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryA rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a severe injury of the knee. The current gold Standard treatment for young and active patients with instability, is a surgical ACL reconstruction. However, there still is no consensus on which graft is best suited for this.The aim of the current multi-center randomized controlled trial was to investigate the hypothesis that an anatomic single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a (flat) quadriceps tendon autograft is at least as effective as reconstruction of the ruptured anterior cruciate ligament with a patella tendon autograft or a hamstringtendon autograft, in terms of failure, measured 2 years postoperatively. Failure is defined gedefinieerd as pathologicai laxity, complaints of knee instability in the absence of any pathological laxity and/or discontinuïty ofthe graft on MRl or arthroscopy.Detailed DescriptionA rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a severe injury of the knee. The current gold Standard treatment for young and active patients with instability, is a surgical ACL reconstruction. However, there still is no consensus on which graft is best suited for this. Paradigms on the different types of auto grafts and their weaknesses and benefits originate mostly from the eighties and nineties, when the patella tendon was being replaced by the hamstring graft as the 'new' gold standerd. Nowadays, the philosophy of isometrie tunnel placement has been abandoned, and has been replaced by the philosophy of anatomie reconstructions. The question then arises: Are the results of the comparative studies, and the current paradigms, still applicable, now that the philosophy has transitioned from isometric to anatomic tunnel placement? Irrespective of the disadvantages compared to the patellatendon autograft, such as a higher re-rupture and revision percentage when used in patients under 25 years old, the hamstring autograft is currently the most used graft for ACL reconstruction worldwide. The question then arises: is it justified that the hamstringgraft is the most used graft worldwide? Rehabilitation protocols are often not, or poorly, described, despite it's significant effect on the outcome and co morbidity of an ACL reconstruction. Especially anterior knee pain, which is often mentioned as a disadvantage of the patellagraft, is significantly influenced by rehabilitation protocols. The introduction and implementation of a nation-wide evidence-based rehabilitation protocol in The Netherlands created uniformity of rehabilitation treatment, and the possibility to generalize scientific conclusions. The question then arises: Due to new insights in rehabilitation and implementation of new protocols, is the anterior knee pain, the often mentioned disadvantage ofthe patelia tendon graft, stiil a relevant disadvantage? The quadriceps tendon autograft is a less often used graft. Nevertheless, research has shown that it seems like a good alternative for the patella tendon and hamstring autograft. Functional outcome is similar, while less donorsite morbidity is reported compared to the patellatendon and hamstring autograft. The question then arises: Is it fair that the quadriceps tendon is rarely used as an autograft for ACL reconstruction? Increasing knowledge of the anatomy of the ACL results in new insights in the methods to achieve true anatomie ACL reconstruction. New arguments support the use of the patella tendon - and even the quadriceps tendon - over the use of the hamstringgraft, because their anatomic similarities to the anterior cruciate ligament might be better suited to restore knee kinematics. The question then arises: are the flat-shaped patella tendon autograft and quadriceps tendon autograft better suited to restore the anatomy of the ruptured ACL than the round hamstring graft? Hypothesis Tlie hypothesis is that anatomic reconstruction ofthe ruptured anterior cruciate ligament with a (flat) quadriceps tendon autograft is at least as effective as reconstruction of the ruptured anterior cruciate ligament with a patella tendon autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft, in terms of failure, measured 2 years postoperatively. Failure is defined as pathological laxity, complaints of knee instability in the absence of any pathological laxity and/or discontinuïty of the graft on MRl or arthroscopy. Objective of the study: Primary objective: To investigate the hypothesis that an anatomic single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a (flat) quadriceps tendon autograft is at least as effective as reconstruction of the ruptured anterior cruciate ligament with a patella tendon autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft, in terms of failure, measured 2 years postoperatively. Failure is defined gedefinieerd as pathologicai laxity, complaints of knee instability in the absence of any pathological laxity and/or discontinuïty of the graft on MRl or arthroscopy. Secondary objectives: patiënt reported outcome measures (PROMs), clinimetrics, radiological assessment, duration of rehabilitation necessary for return to sports and daily activities and the level of sport activities to which the patiënt returned, in patients treated with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a patellatendon autograft, hamstringtendon autograft of quadricepstendon autograft, as measured in the short-term (6 weeks, 6,9,12 months postoperatively), mid-term (2 years postoperatively) and long-term (5 and 10 years postoperatively). Study design: Multicenter blocked stratified randomised controlled trial with varying block sizes (n=3, 6, 9, 12). Patients with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture, confirmed by an orthopaedie surgeon (as evident from anamnesis, physical examination and radiographic imaging) who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have any of the exclusion criteria, will be asked to partieipate in this study. Baseline measurements will be performed, after informed consent is obtained. Allocation of treatment of the included patients will be performed in the operating room (OR), where patients will be randomised (blocked and stratified) per clinic, to have ACL reconstruction with a patella tendon autograft, hamstring tendon autograft or quadriceps tendon autograft.

Hypothesis: 2-a There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and isometric muscles strength in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-b There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and single-hop test in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-c There will be a correlation between self-reported knee function and psychological factors in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-d There will be a correlation between isometric muscles strength and single-hop test in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-e There will be a correlation between isometric muscles strength and psychological factors in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. 2-f There will be a correlation between single-hop test and psychological factors in ACLR patients at discharge from rehabilitation. Study Procedure After the participants confirm that they are interested in the study, they will be seen again at the rehabilitation class during their regular hospital appointment. During the participants' last visit to the rehabilitation department, they will be briefed again about the study, and if they agree to partake, they will be asked to sign the consent form. Self-reported knee function The participants will be asked to complete the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire on symptoms, stiffness, pain, function daily living, function sport sand recreational activities and quality of life, and The International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC) questionnaire, which assesses symptoms, function, and sports activity. Psychological factors The participants will be asked to complete The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (fear of movement) (TSK) which is a questionnaire that assesses pain related fear of movement followed by the Anterior Cruciate ligament Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scales, which is a questionnaire that measures athletes' emotions, confidence in performance, and risk appraisal concerning to returning to sport following an ACL injury. A demographics form (age, height and weight) will also be completed. Isometric muscle strength To gather isometric muscle strength data on each participant, data on isometric muscle strength for both legs will be obtained using two different tests for knee extensors and knee flexors muscles, using a hand-held dynamometer (HHD). The participants will be asked to wear sports clothing. The strength of both lower limbs of the participants will be assessed using the HHD, with peak force measured throughout five seconds of muscle contraction. Quadriceps muscles will be measured by first requesting the participants sit on the edge of the treatment bed with their knees 90 degrees flexion and both feet off the ground. The participants will then be asked to apply maximum force in extending the knee joint against the HHD device, which will be fixed using a belt and placed in front of the leg proximal to the ankle joint. They will be asked to do so for five seconds, and to repeat three times with 30 seconds of rest in between. The maximum peak force will be recorded throughout the three trials. To measure hamstring muscles, participants will be instructed to sit on the edge of the treatment bed with 90 degrees' flexion in the knee with both feet off the ground. Then, participants will be instructed to apply maximum force to flex knee joint against the immovable HHD device that will be fixed with a belt and placed at the back of the leg proximal to the ankle joint. They will be asked to so for five seconds, and this will be repeated three times with 30 seconds of rest in between. Maximum peak force will be recorded throughout the three trials. Functional tasks Participants will be requested to perform a single-leg hop for distance, and this will be assessed using a standard metric tape measure. A 3m strip of tape will be placed on the floor, with the start line labelled using a 0.3m strip of tape placed perpendicular to the 3m strip of tape. The participants will be performed three practice trials for the hop test. After finishing the practice trials, four test trials will be asked to perform a single leg hop for distance as described by (Bolgla and Keskula, 1997). Attempts will be classified as successful provided the participant hops and lands with full stability on one leg for three seconds. The participants will be required to achieve four maximum hop attempts with complete stabilisation after landing for three seconds. Attempts will be deemed unsuccessful if the participant hops and touches the ground with their other leg during landing, or if they fail to hop within the limited marked distance; any failed hops will be counted and noted, but not processed. The participant's leg length will be measured while they are lying in a supine position before the first test using a standard tape measure to measure from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the distal tip of the medial malleolus. Leg length will be used during data analysis to normalise excursion distances. The participants will begin with their toe on the starting line, standing on one leg, before hopping as far as they can horizontally and landing on the same leg, and the distance hopped will be recorded. The hop data will be normalised to limb length by dividing the distance covered by the participant's leg length and then multiplying by 100, resulting in a percentage value. After completing the test, the participants will be asked to repeat the procedure with the other leg.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT03047187,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03047187,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT03047187&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Can Targeted Exercise Improve Knee Strength in Patients With Persisting Hamstring Deficiency Following ACL-reconstruction? - A Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,5/15/2025,5/15/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2016). Date of Publication: 4 Oct 2016,clinicaltrials.gov,2016,,,,,4-Oct-16,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryAnterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is high volume surgery, carried out in about 2800 patients annually in Denmark per year. ACLR patients (using hamstring auto-graft) have persistent hamstring strength deficiency when evaluated more than 1-2 years after ACL-reconstruction. The investigators have designed this randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the main purpose to investigate the effect of a targeted muscle strength exercise intervention on the neuromuscular rehabilitation of ACLR-patients compared with 'care-as- usual'. The study is designed as a prospective, superiority, parallel-group with balanced randomization (1:1) RCT (Level of evidence: II) with blinded allocation, and outcome assessment according to the CONSORT statement (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). 50 patients with ACL reconstruction and persistent hamstring muscle deficiency, will be recruited at the outpatient clinic 1-year follow-up, and allocated to one of two 12 weeks' interventions, either a) the supervised progressive strength and neuromuscular exercise group (SNG) with supervised training twice weekly. Or b) the control group (CON) receiving patient education based on a home-based exercise regime of low intensity, defined as 'care as usual'. Outcome measures include, maximal isometric knee flexor muscle strength (primary outcome), knee extensor strength, and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (secondary outcomes). In addition, the following explorative outcomes will be investigated; hamstring to quadriceps strength ratios, the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate tendon regeneration of the hamstrings and finally kinetic/kinematic biomechanical outcomes of knee related functional tasks. To the investigators knowledge, this is the first RCT to investigate the efficacy of combined progressive resistance training and neuromuscular exercise in the late rehabilitation phase in patients demonstrating persistent limb-to-limb knee muscle asymmetry following ACLR.

However, clinical outcomes have not been examined, and high loads on the lower extremity could be detrimental to knee articular cartilage.PURPOSE: To compare the immediate effect of low- and high-intensity plyometric exercise during rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction on knee function, articular cartilage metabolism, and other clinically relevant measures.STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.METHODS: Twenty-four patients who underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction (mean, 14.3 weeks after surgery; range, 12.1-17.7 weeks) were assigned to 8 weeks (16 visits) of low- or high-intensity plyometric exercise consisting of running, jumping, and agility activities. Groups were distinguished by the expected magnitude of vertical ground-reaction forces. Testing was conducted before and after the intervention. Primary outcomes were self-reported knee function (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] subjective knee form) and a biomarker of articular cartilage degradation (urine concentrations of crosslinked C-telopeptide fragments of type II collagen [uCTX-II]). Secondary outcomes included additional biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism (urinary concentrations of the neoepitope of type II collagen cleavage at the C-terminal three-quarter-length fragment [uC2C], serum concentrations of the C-terminal propeptide of newly formed type II collagen [sCPII]) and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α), functional performance (maximal vertical jump and single-legged hop), knee impairments (anterior knee laxity, average knee pain intensity, normalized quadriceps strength, quadriceps symmetry index), and psychosocial status (kinesiophobia, knee activity self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing). The change in each measure was compared between groups. Values before and after the intervention were compared with the groups combined.RESULTS: The groups did not significantly differ in the change of any primary or secondary outcome measure. Of interest, sCPII concentrations tended to change in opposite directions (mean ± SD: low-intensity group, 28.7 ± 185.5 ng/mL; high-intensity group, -200.6 ± 255.0 ng/mL; P = .097; Cohen d = 1.03). Across groups, significant changes after the intervention were increased the IKDC score, vertical jump height, normalized quadriceps strength, quadriceps symmetry index, and knee activity self-efficacy and decreased average knee pain intensity.CONCLUSION: No significant differences were detected between the low- and high-intensity plyometric exercise groups. Across both groups, plyometric exercise induced positive changes in knee function, knee impairments, and psychosocial status that would support the return to sports participation after ACL reconstruction. The effect of plyometric exercise intensity on articular cartilage requires further evaluation.REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01851655.",,,ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01851655),English,English,,26797700,L615995431,10.1177/0363546515620583,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546515620583,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L615995431&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546515620583&atitle=Low-+Versus+High-Intensity+Plyometric+Exercise+During+Rehabilitation+After+Anterior+Cruciate+Ligament+Reconstruction&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=44&issue=3&spage=609&epage=617&aulast=Chmielewski&aufirst=Terese+L.&auinit=T.L.&aufull=Chmielewski+T.L.&coden=&isbn=&pages=609-617&date=2016&auinit1=T&auinitm=L,Copyright 2017 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture; RecOnsTruction Or Repair?,,,,,,6/2/2025,6/2/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2014). Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2014,clinicaltrials.gov,2014,,,,,1-Dec-14,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryTo investigate the hypothesis that suture repair of a ruptured vkb, combined with a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization and microfracture of the femoral notch, results in at least equal effectiveness compared with an ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring in terms of functional recovery one year postoperatively in terms of a patient self-reported outcome related to be able to conduct daily and sporting activities. Secondary, the evaluation of clinical outcomes, self-reported by the patient outcomes, osteoarthritis, rehabilitation time required for return to daily and sporting activities and levels of sporting activity which has returned in patients with status after an ACL rupture and suture repair augmented with a dynamic intraligamentary microfracture and stabilization of the femoral notch in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the ipsilateral hamstring graft.Detailed DescriptionBackground of the study: An anterior cruciate ligament rupture is a serious injury to the knee with high probability of the occurrence of dynamic instability, accompanying lesions and early post-traumatic arthrosis. Despite conservative treatment through rehabilitation or ACL reconstruction surgery not all patients do return to their previous activity levels. Moreover degenerative changes, especially early posttraumatic arthrosis, are not counteracted. In order to optimize the clinical results after ACL surgery, a renewed interest has emerged in healing the patient's own ruptured ACL after attaching. Literature suggests that with the current innovations in surgical repair techniques of (natural) healing of a ruptured ACL may result in similar clinical outcomes in comparison to the gold standard, the ACL reconstruction. In addition, it may even reduce degenerative changes occur in relation to the gold standard. Moreover, the return to daily activities and sports level seems significantly faster than after ACL reconstruction. The hypothesis is that a suture (suture repair) of a ruptured ACL, combined with a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization, as well as microfracture of the femoral notch, passes, at least equal efficacy in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autologous hamstrings in terms of functional recovery 1 years postoperatively. The DIS bonding technique will be applied in the current study to surgically repair (suture) the ruptured ACL. DIS is an abbreviation and stands for intraligamentary dynamic stabilization (DIS). DIS has been used in humans and seems to provide a high patient satisfaction, favorable clinical and radiological results. However, to our knowledge, to date, no randomized comparative study has been conducted yet in which the DIS technique is compared with the gold standard, the ACL reconstruction. Objective of the study: Primary goal: Investigate the hypothesis that suture repair of a ruptured vkb, combined with a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization and microfracture of the femoral notch, results in at least equal effectiveness compared with an ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring in terms of functional recovery one year postoperatively in terms of a patient self-reported outcome related to be able to conduct daily and sporting activities. Secondary objective: Evaluation of clinical outcomes, self-reported by the patient outcomes, osteoarthritis, rehabilitation time required for return to daily and sporting activities and levels of sporting activity which has returned in patients with status after an ACL rupture and suture repair augmented with a dynamic intraligamentary microfracture and stabilization of the femoral notch in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the ipsilateral hamstring graft. Study design: This study is a single center stratified block randomized controlled trial. Patients with ACL rupture, confirmed by an orthopedic surgeon based on the outpatient history and radiographic images, will be randomized into an experimental ('repair' / DIS) group after inclusion and a control (reconstruction, regular care) group. Patients will be stratified on the level of sport/physical active practice, on the basis of the Tegner score. The Tegner score is an evaluative and inventory questionnaire on which the patient indicates the gravity of his work and/or sports activities. A higher score is associated with a higher level of physical strain/activity . On the basis of the Tegner score patients will be stratified into a 'moderate' physically active stratum (group Tegner score 5-6-7) and 'highly' physically active stratum (group Tegner score 8 -9-10). Stratification based on the degree of physical activity is considered to be important because the extent and severity of physical activity/strain in daily life poses a potential (difference) in risk of re-rupture between the two study arms. In order to minimize potential differences in 'exposure' or 'risk of re-rupture' between the two study groups stratification is relevant.Measurements take place at baseline, peri-operative / immediately after surgery, 6 weeks, 3,6,9 months and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years postoperatively. Study population: (Physically) active patients from 18 untill 30 years, who has visited the outpatient clinic of the orthopedic surgeon because of a knee injury resulting in a ACL rupture, for whom surgery indication for an ACL reconstruction exists and who can be operated on within three weeks after the onset of the ACL rupture. Intervention: n=48 patients will participate in the current study. Patients will be assigned to a suture repair of the ruptured vkb complemented by a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) and microfracture of the femoral notch or the gold standard, a ACL reconstruction.

Saunders,"Purpose The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to compare knee stability, kneeling pain, harvest site pain, sensitivity loss, and subjective clinical outcome after primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with either bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or quadriceps tendon-bone (QTB) autografts in a noninferiority study design. Methods From 2005 to 2009, a total of 51 patients were included in the present study. Inclusion criteria were isolated ACL injuries in adults. Twenty-five patients were randomized to BPTB grafts and 26 to QTB grafts. An independent examiner performed follow-up evaluations 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Anteroposterior knee laxity was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA). Anterior knee pain was assessed clinically and by knee-walking ability. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were used for patient-evaluated outcome. Results Anterior knee laxity was equal between the 2 groups with KT-1000 values of 1.1 ± 1.4 mm and 0.8 ± 1.7 mm standard deviation (SD) at follow-up in QTB and BPTB groups, respectively (P =.65), whereas positive pivot shift test results were seen less frequently (14% compared with 38%, respectively; P =.03). Anterior kneeling pain, evaluated by the knee walking ability test, was significantly less in the QTB group, with only 7% of patients grading knee walking as difficult or impossible compared with 34% in the BPTB group. At 1 and 2 years' follow-up, there was no difference between the 2 groups in subjective patient-evaluated outcome. The IKDC score was 75 ± 13 patients and 76 ± 16 SD at 1-year follow-up in QTB and BPTB groups, respectively (P =.78). At 2 years, 12 patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in 18 in the BPTB group and 21 in the QTB group. Conclusions The use of the QTB graft results in less kneeling pain, graft site pain, and sensitivity loss than seen with BPTB grafts; however, similar anterior knee stability and subjective outcomes are seen. The results of this study show that QTB is a viable option for ACL reconstruction.

A total of 49 patients between 16 and 50 years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus and gracilis autografts were randomly assigned to an early start OKC (EOKC) exercise group or a late start OKC (LOKC) exercise group. The EOKC group (n = 25; mean age, 26 years) received a rehabilitation protocol with an early start of OKC (fourth week postoperatively) within a restricted ROM between 45° and 90°. The LOKC group (n = 24; mean age, 24 years) performed the same protocol with a late start of OKC exercises between 0° and 90° (12th week postoperatively). Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Lysholm knee scoring scale, single-legged and crossover hop tests, and anterior knee laxity were measured to assess outcomes at the 12-week, 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month postoperative follow-up (range, 13-24 months). No difference (P < .05) was noted between groups with respect to demographic data. Both groups (EOKC and LOKC) had a higher level of function and less pain at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month assessments when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P < .05). The EOKC group had improved quadriceps muscle strength at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month follow-up when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P < .05); the LOKC group showed improvement only at the 17-month postoperative assessment. However, the analysis between groups showed no difference for all pain and functional assessments, including anterior knee laxity (P > .05). An early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strengthening in a restricted ROM did not differ from a late start in terms of anterior knee laxity. The EOKC group reached the same findings in relation to pain decrease and functional improvement when compared with the LOKC group but showed a faster recovery in quadriceps strength. The nonweightbearing exercises seem appropriate for patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction, when utilized in a specific ROM. The magnitude of difference in quadriceps strength between the 2 rehabilitation protocols was around 5%; however, this difference was not clinically significant, especially because both groups had equal function on the hop tests.",,,,English,,,23423316,L563021956,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L563021956&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=15523365&id=doi:&atitle=Open+kinetic+chain+exercises+in+a+restricted+range+of+motion+after+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+a+randomized+controlled+clinical+trial.&stitle=Am+J+Sports+Med&title=The+American+journal+of+sports+medicine&volume=41&issue=4&spage=788&epage=794&aulast=Fukuda&aufirst=Thiago+Yukio&auinit=T.Y.&aufull=Fukuda+T.Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=788-794&date=2013&auinit1=T&auinitm=Y,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Methods: Sixty-two ACL-insufficient patients were included in a prospective, randomized study (31 BPT and 31 HT). Both surgical procedures were performed without any implants by a press-fit technique by the senior author. The femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal for anatomic placement. At 8.8 years after reconstruction, 53 patients (28 BPT and 25 HT) were examined by different clinical and functional tests. Bilateral MRI scans were performed and interpreted by an independent radiologist. Results: On follow-up, the score on the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form was significantly better in the HT group. The clinical examination including range of motion, KT-1000 test (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and pivot-shift test showed no significant differences. On isokinetic testing, the mean quadriceps strength was close to normal (96%) in both groups, but the hamstring strength was lower in the HT group (100.3%/95.1%). Kneeling (1.5/1.1, P = .002), knee walking (1.72/1.14, P = .002), and single-leg hop test (95.8%/99.1%, P = .057) were better in the HT group. The MRI findings about the mean degree of cartilage lesion (International Cartilage Repair Society protocol) of the operated (2.1/2.1) and nonoperated (1.4/1.8) knee showed no significant differences. No significant difference was found in the grade of medial or lateral meniscal lesion or the number of patients having meniscal lesions when the operated and nonoperated knees were compared. Tunnel measurements, Caton-Deschamps Index, and the sagittal ACL angle were similar. Conclusions: The implant-free press-fit technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by use of bonepatellar tendon and hamstring grafts with anatomic graft placement is an innovative technique to preserve the cartilage and meniscal status without significant differences between the operated and nonoperated knees in the long term. Significantly less anterior knee pain was noted in the hamstring group, when testing for kneeling and knee walking.

Effects of Hamstring Training in Different Modes on Stabilizing Knee Joints With Anterior Drawer Laxity,,,,,,5/28/2025,5/28/2025,clinicaltrials.gov (2010). Date of Publication: 23 Jul 2010,clinicaltrials.gov,2010,,,,,23-Jul-10,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryQuestion: To investigate how different modes of thigh muscles strengthening exercises emphasizing the knee internal rotators can be as effective as possible in improving the static stability and agility of the knees with anterior drawer laxity. Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants and Interventions: Young men with anterior drawer laxity of the knee were randomly assigned to three experimental groups in different strengthening modes: plate-loaded squat press (SP), plate-loaded kneeling leg curl with internal rotation (KLCIR), and kneeling leg curl (KLC). The control group with stable knees received no training. Outcome measures: static and dynamic knee stability, isokinetic strength. The purpose of this paper was to find out an optimal solution to the enhancement of the static and dynamic knee stability to a great extent. Key words: anterior cruciate ligament; agility; knee stability; hamstring; knee internal rotatorDetailed DescriptionINTRODUCTION Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are commonly seen among athletes, which eventually makes more or less devastating impacts on their performances. Although ACL injuries may result from the knee collision, 70% of them are due to noncontact movements, including abrupt brakes, changing directions at high speed (i.e. sidestep cuttings and crossover cuttings). In doing so, one must at first have his or her axial foot fixed on the ground to absorb the momentum oriented from the original direction. Insufficient eccentric muscles or ligament strength are likely to trigger muscle and ligament injuries. It is generally agreed that the risk of ligament injuries can be reduced by strengthening a specific muscle group by which the dynamic stability of the joint is able to be enhanced and the static stability provided by the ligament can also be compensated. Traditionally, the strengthening exercise of ACL rehabilitation has been putting an emphasis on the hamstring and quadriceps with an attempt to decrease the anterior drawer instability as well as the shearing force of ACL. Nonetheless, from the aforementioned pathomechanism of ACL injuries, the knee rotators should be valued as they are supposed to . The internal rotators of the knee joint (semitendinosus, semimembranosus and gracilis) are highly related to ACL injuries5. However, the knee rotator strength is often neglected and even sacrificed as an autograft for the ACL reconstruction . Modifications can be made in progressive resistance exercise for strengthening knee internal rotators. In this current study, 20 subjects with anterior drawer laxity were randomly assigned to three groups adopting different training modes: plate-loaded squat press (SP), plate-loaded kneeling leg curl with internal rotation (KLCIR), and plate-loaded kneeling leg curl (KLC). Static stability, dynamic stability, and isokinetic strength were measured. The purpose of this paper was to find out an optimal solution to the enhancement of the static and dynamic knee stability to a great extent. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects The research program was approved by the Human Subject Committee in Taipei Physical Education College. Knee joint laxity was surveyed by a KT-2000 test (MED Metric Co., San Diego, USA) in the Department of Physical Education and Health at Taipei Physical Education College. The anterior drawer laxity of the knee joint in this study was defined as anterior displacement over 3 mm discrepancy between bilateral knee joints by a KT-2000 test under 20-pound force. According to this criterion, Dale M. et al. demonstrated that 85% (33/39) of this population have complete ACL tears and 15% (6/39) have partial tear. One hundred and seventy-three students were tested and 30 met the criterion, including 22 males and 8 females, although no obvious trauma history was available in some of them. Two males were excluded due to other causes that might affect muscle strength or knee stability such as lower limbs fracture and arthritis. Besides, eight female students were eliminated to avoid possible gender difference. Twenty male students were included in the experimental group. Another 8 male students with stable knees without any medical history of knee injuries were included in the control group. The participants in both experimental and control groups lived a sedentary lifestyle. Stable knees were defined as a discrepancy less than 1.5mm between bilateral knees by a KT-2000 test under 20-pound force. Flow Path Twenty subjects in the experimental group were randomly assigned into three groups: SP (n=7), KLCIR (n=7) and KLC (n=6). Eight control subjects neither received any training nor was engaged in body-building on their own during the training period. Every subject was asked to fill in basic information, including age, body height, and body weight. Before the experiments, the flow path was explained to each subject who had already signed an informed-consent form. The experimental procedure was divided into three phases. The first and the third phases were the tests before and after training respectively, including KT-2000, agility, and isokinetic strength assessment. The second phase was the training phase. Static Stability (Laxity) The KT-2000 knee ligament arthrometer (MED Metric Co., San Diego, USA) is designed to assess the anterior drawer laxity of the knee joint. The discrepancy of anterior displacement between the sound side and the lesion side had been reported and applied in evaluating the static stability of the knee, and it was also used as one of the references for the ACL reconstruction surgery. In this current study, a discrepancy less than 1.5mm was normally accepted when 20-pound anterior traction force was exerted on the tibia with the knee joint in 20° flexion. In contrast, ACL laxity was defined as a discrepancy over 3mm, which was highly related to ACL injury. Dynamic Stability (Agility) Dynamic knee stability was assessed by agility, which was measured by a 6-meter left-and-right shuttle run. A good dynamic knee stability is necessary for changing the movement direction. Each subject started running from the midline to the left terminal and then stepped on the square with his left foot. Then, the subject used the left leg as the axis and turned around to the right side. The subject then ran to the right terminal. Once the front foot was crossing the midline, this was the first round for testing the agility of left knee. The subject kept running to the right terminal without stopping on the midline, stepping on the square with his right foot, turning around to the left side, and running toward the left terminal. This was the first round of right knee test as the subject's front foot crossed the midline. Whenever the front foot crossed the midline, a timer was clocked. The time interval in seconds between the 1st and the 2nd time clocked was the 1st measure of the left knee agility, and the time interval between the 2nd and the 3rd was the 1st measure of the right knee agility, and so forth. There were five-round tests for the agility of right and left knees respectively. Three raters were assigned respectively at the midline, right and left terminals. Single-blind method was adopted. That is, all the three raters did not know which group the subject was assigned to. The square at the right or left terminal ends was 10 inches wide and 3 meters away from the midline. It would be recognized as a qualified round if the plantar surface of the foot ever contacted any part of the square; otherwise, the subject would be asked to repeat the whole set consisting of five rounds. Three sets were collected and averaged. The rest interval between each set should be long enough for the examinee to feel relaxed before the next set. The subject was asked to run as fast as possible. The average time difference of 3 sets between the affected and the sound side was regarded as the dynamic stability of the affected side. The greater the difference was, the poorer the dynamic stability or the agility would be. A practice session was given prior to the actual beginning of the study to avoid learning effect. Prior to the study, intrarater test-retest reliability was established. Nine subjects, including four in the experimental groups and five in the control group, took the agility exam twice in separated days. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.78. Isokinetic Strength Cybex NORM (Cybex International, Inc, Ronkonkoma, New York, U.S.A.) was employed to evaluate isokinetic muscle strength before and after training. Tests were conducted in two different motion modes which included the flexor/extensor and the internal /external rotator. In the former, the range of motion was set in the range of 0-90°. Maximal concentric force had been performed for five times at the angular velocity of 60°, 120° and 180° per second, respectively. Peak torque was taken to represent muscle strength. Only smooth and similar curves with a peak torque which was no less than 90% of the maximum would be taken. The assessment of isokinetic strength of internal/external rotator was generally similar to flexor/extensor. The ankle joint was fixed into 30° dorsiflexion with an air-stirrup ankle brace (Aircast, Summit, NJ) to limit unnecessary inversion/eversion movement, which might affect measurement of knee joint rotation. In addition, the knee and hip joints were kept in 90°, and the range of motion of knee rotation was set in the range between 25° internally and 35° externally. Training Modes Three training modes were chosen. (Ⅰ) SP (or called angled leg presses); (Ⅱ) KLCIR; (Ⅲ) KLC. The training phase had been lasting for 6 weeks in which none dropped out. Each subject had to accomplish three training workouts weekly under supervision by licensed athletic trainers. A workout contained five sets for each lower limb, which were composed of 20 (repetitions)×60% (1RM), 15×65% , 12×70% , 8×75% and 20×60% with a two-minute resting interval between each set. During the six-week rehabilitation course, they were not allowed to involve in any other regular fitness activities or sports. Data Analysis Data are expressed as mean±SEM. SPSS version 12.0 Windows was used for statistic analysis. Nonparametric analysis, including Kruskal-Wallis Test, Wilcoxon Test and Mann-Whitney test, was applied. Significance was defined as P\<0.05. Intrarater reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient.",,,,English,English,,,LNCT01170546,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01170546,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT01170546&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

PURPOSE: The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of hamstring isokinetic training used in the early phase of the rehabilitation program on the stability, strength, symptoms, and functional outcomes of patients throughout 12 months after anterior cruciate ligament surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Forty-eight men underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an ipsilateral bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. The patients were randomly assigned to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 3 weeks (group I) or to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 9 weeks (group II). The patients were evaluated monthly for the first 4 months and at the 12th month for postoperative hamstring and quadriceps strength, as well as for knee function via the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale and International Knee Documentation Committee form. RESULTS: Hamstring isometric strength at 30 degrees of knee flexion (at the first and second months) and concentric isokinetic strength (at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months) at the angular velocity of 60 deg/s were significantly (P <.05-.01) greater in group I compared with group II. Average scores of the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale for symptoms were significantly (P <.05-.001) higher in group I compared with group II at all evaluation periods. Walking and stair-climbing scores at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months and squatting score at all evaluation periods were also better (P <.05-.01) in group I compared with group II. In addition, group I exhibited better (P <.01-.001) Lachman test results compared with group II for all postoperative evaluation periods. The International Knee Documentation Committee final rating scores were significantly (P <.01) greater at 2, 3, and 4 months in group I compared with group II.

Another aim was to compare the ACL-reconstructed knee with the ACL-injured and the uninjured knees for differences in anterior tibial translation and muscle activation during the exercises. Sagittal tibial translation and muscle activation were measured during the Lachman test (static translation) and during seven rehabilitation exercises (dynamic translation) in 19 patients. Results obtained 5 weeks after ACL reconstruction were compared with those obtained before the ACL reconstruction (ACL-deficient and uninjured knee). After ACL reconstruction the seated knee extension produced more anterior tibial translation than the straight leg raise and standing on one leg. The ACL reconstruction reduced the static and the dynamic tibial translation and the tibial translations measured in ACL-reconstructed knees were similar to those measured in uninjured knees. After ACL reconstruction, the patients used a joint stiffening strategy that used more hamstring activation and reduced the dynamic tibial translation.

Date of Publication: 9 Jun 2008,clinicaltrials.gov,2008,,,,,9-Jun-08,Clinical Trial,,,,,,,clinicaltrials.gov,"Brief SummaryThe study that is registered in ClinicalTrials is a part study of an overall study with the title 'Dynamic stability of the ACL-injured knee'. The aim of the overall study is to prospectively follow a cohort of newly injured patients with total rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee, in order to document results from different rehabilitation regimes after the injury. The title of the part study is 'Neuromuscular changes in ACL-deficient individuals before and after an intensive perturbation training program. A case-control study.' The aims of the part study are: 1. To describe muscle activation patterns, joint angles and forces during gait and one-legged hop in newly injured ACL-deficient individuals before and after execution of an intensive training program consisting of either perturbation training or conventional balance- and stability training 2. To describe eventual changes between the two groups that may indicate superiority of either one of the methods The study will include 25 subjects in each group. The intervention consists of two different rehabilitation protocols for neuromuscular training. Subjects will be tested in a biomechanical laboratory before and after intervention, with use of 3D camera systems, force plates and electromyographic measurements (EMG). Main outcomes are eventual differences in muscle activation patterns, joint angles and forces during selected phases of walking and one-legged hopping. Secondary outcomes of interest are self-assessment of knee function, isokinetic strength and functional one-legged hop tests. Status: Inclusion to the main study started in January 2007. Data collection for the case-control part study will take place in 2008-2009. The part study study should be finished in 2010, where results will be included in a PhD dissertation. The PhD student responsible, Ingrid Eitzen, is enrolled in the Doctoral program at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo. She is employed at Orthopaedic Centre, Ullevaal University Hospital and part of The Norwegian Research Center for Active Rehabilitation (NAR). The project is included in the NAR research program. In addition, the overall study is organized as a formalized collaboration with the University of Delaware, US, where they also will follow a cohort of 150 subjects.Detailed DescriptionThe study 'Dynamic stability of the ACL-injured knee' is carried out as part of a formalized research collaboration between the University of Delaware, US, and NAR, Orthopaedic Centre, Ullevaal University Hospital, Norway. The project is funded by National Institutes of Health. 150 patients, both men and women, aged between 13-55 years, will over a three year-period be enrolled in the study. Follow-up time is 2 years. A part-study will have a case-control design and include 50 of the patients. In Norway, approximately 4000 persons rupture their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)per year. The majority of these individuals are relatively young people, engaged in various physical activities. Most ACL-ruptures occur within pivoting sports like soccer, team handball, floorball, basketball and volleyball, but also within racket sports, ice-hockey, dance/gymnastics and alpine skiing. A ruptured ACL is a serious injury for the individual, who often experiences exclusion form both work, leisure activities and sports for potentially a long period of time. A considerable number of the patients will not be able to return to their pre-injury activity level, and many will also experience long time consequences, the most serious of these being development of knee osteoarthritis(OA). The function of the injured knee varies considerably among patients with a torn ACL. Some are able to stabilize their knees even during demanding activities and sports, while others experience frequent episodes of giving way, also following daily activities. Currently, there is little consensus regarding the optimal rehabilitation program following ACL injury and/or criteria for ACL-reconstruction. But, whether managed operatively or non-operatively, a full return to pre-injury activities after ACL rupture is always dependent on the development of dynamic knee stability. In the past 10-15 years, a test battery consisting of standardised and validated tests for screening and classification of newly injured ACL-patients has been developed. The test battery includes four different functional one-legged hop tests, two questionnaires on knee function and self-evaluation of knee status in the form of a global rating. The questionnaires included are The Knee Outcome Survey - Activities of Daily Living (KOS-ADL), and The International Knee Documentation Subjective Knee Form (IKDC 2000). In addition, we measure the laxity between the tibia and femur with KT1000, register eventual number of episodes of giving way and perform isokinetic strength measurements of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles with a Biodex6000 system. Based on these tests, all newly diagnosed patients with an ACL-rupture may be classified according to whether they have good or poor dynamic stability. Those with 80% or more performance on the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg on all hop tests, who score 80 or more in KOS-ADL, who rate themselves to a score of at least 60 on the global rating and have experienced maximum one episode of giving way, are categorized as potential copers. Those who score below these limits and/or have experienced two or more episodes of giving way are categorized as non-copers. In Norway, approximately 50% of all ACL-injured individuals go through reconstructive surgery. The optimal time to decide whether surgery is the best treatment option or not is highly individual, but recent research has demonstrated that the functional status of the knee at the time of eventual surgery is more important than the time span since the date of injury. Reconstructive surgery will to a large degree re-establish the mechanical stability of the knee, but has not been proven to provide sufficient dynamical stability or make the patient able to return to his/hers pre-injury activity level. It can at present time neither be documented that reconstructive ACL-surgery reduces the risk of later development of knee OA. Several questions remain that will affect the development of effective rehabilitation programs for patients after ACL rupture. Validated practice guidelines for patients after ACL injury that discriminate between surgical and non-surgical candidates, lead to a return to pre-injury activities, and protect future joint health have not been reported. The case-control part study will aim specifically to investigate the effectiveness of two different protocols for neuromuscular training, with before- and after intervention data collection in a biomechanical laboratory. Results from the overall study (inclusive the part study) will allow us to extend our previous findings and will provide information that is needed to identify and treat individuals with ACL rupture across the spectrum of compensation strategies. Follow-up during the project includes * Functional one-legged hop tests * Instrumental measurement of knee laxity (KT1000) * Isokinetic strength testing of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles * Biomechanical analyses of gait and one-legged hops in the Motion Analysis Laboratory at the Norwegian University of Sport Sciences * Self-assessment of knee function in the form of global rating",,,,English,English,,,LNCT00696319,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00696319,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT00696319&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Hypothesis: A comprehensive rehabilitation program supplemented with quadriceps strengthening in open kinetic chain (OKC) exercise will increase quadriceps strength and improve knee function without increasing static or dynamic sagittal tibial translation, compared with the same comprehensive rehabilitation program supplemented with quadriceps strengthening in closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise, in patients with acute ACL deficiency. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Forty-two patients were tested a mean of 43 days (range, 20-96 days) after an ACL injury. Patients were randomized to rehabilitation with CKC quadriceps strengthening (11 men and 9 women) or OKC quadriceps strengthening (13 men and 9 women). Aside from these quadriceps exercises, the 2 rehabilitation programs were identical. Patients were assessed after 4 months of rehabilitation. Sagittal static translation and dynamic tibial translation were evaluated with a CA-4000 electrogoniometer. Muscle strength, jump performance, and muscle activation were also assessed. Functional outcome was evaluated by determining the Lysholm score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Results: There were no group differences in static or dynamic translation after rehabilitation. The OKC group had significantly greater isokinetic quadriceps strength after rehabilitation (P =.009). The hamstring strength, performance on the 1-repetition-maximum squat test, muscle activation, jump performance, and functional outcome did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Rehabilitation with OKC quadriceps exercise led to significantly greater quadriceps strength compared with rehabilitation with CKC quadriceps exercise. Hamstring strength, static and dynamic translation, and functional outcome were similar between groups. Patients with ACL deficiency may need OKC quadriceps strengthening to regain good muscle torque. © 2008 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.",,,,English,English,2008039076,17940146,L351132377,10.1177/0363546507307867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546507307867,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L351132377&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=03635465&id=doi:10.1177%2F0363546507307867&atitle=A+comprehensive+rehabilitation+program+with+quadriceps+strengthening+in+closed+versus+open+kinetic+chain+exercise+in+patients+with+anterior+cruciate+ligament+deficiency%3A+A+randomized+clinical+trial+evaluating+dynamic+tibial+translation+and+muscle+function&stitle=Am.+J.+Sports+Med.&title=American+Journal+of+Sports+Medicine&volume=36&issue=2&spage=298&epage=307&aulast=Tagesson&aufirst=Sofi&auinit=S.&aufull=Tagesson+S.&coden=AJSMD&isbn=&pages=298-307&date=2008&auinit1=S&auinitm=,"Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Sixty-eight patients, 36 males and 32 females, with either patellar tendon graft (34 patients) or hamstring graft (34 patients) were enrolled in this study. All patients were randomly allocated to either early (the 4th postoperative week) or late (the 12th postoperative week) start of OKC exercises for the quadriceps, resulting in four subgroups: patellar tendon reconstruction, early start (P4) or late start (P12) of OKC quadriceps exercises, hamstring tendon reconstruction, early start (H4) or late start (H12) of quadriceps OKC exercises. Prior to surgery and 3, 5 and 7 months later, assessments of range of motion (goniometer), anterior knee laxity (KT-1000), postural sway (KAT 2000), thigh muscle torques (Kin-Com dynamometer) and anterior knee pain (anterior knee pain score) were evaluated. No significant group differences were found in terms of range of motion 3, 5 and 7 months postoperatively. The H4 group showed a significantly higher mean difference of laxity over time of 1.0 mm (CI: 0.18-1.86) than the P4 group (P = 0.04). Within the same type of surgery, the H4 against the H12, the mean difference over time was 1.2 mm (0.37-2.1) higher in the H4 group than in the H12 group (P = 0.01). There were no significant group differences in terms of postural sway or anterior knee pain at the different test occasions. Significant differences in trends (changes over time) were found when comparing the four groups, for both quadriceps muscle torques (P < 0.001) and hamstring muscle torques (P < 0.001). All groups, except the P4 group, reached preoperative values of quadriceps muscle torques at the 7 months follow-up. In the H4 and the H12 groups, significantly lower hamstring muscle torques at the 7 months follow-up compared with preoperative values were found. In conclusion, early start of OKC quadriceps exercises after hamstring ACL reconstruction resulted in significantly increased anterior knee laxity in comparison with both late start and with early and late start after bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, the early introduction of OKC exercises for quadriceps did not influence quadriceps muscle torques neither in patients operated on patellar tendon nor hamstring tendon grafts. On the contrary, it appears as if the choice of graft affected the strength of the specific muscle more than the type of exercises performed. Our results could not determine the appropriate time for starting OKC quadriceps exercises for patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft. Future studies of long-term results of anterior knee laxity and functional outcome are needed. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,,,English,English,,17219226,L46537522,10.1007/s00167-006-0246-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-006-0246-z,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L46537522&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=09422056&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00167-006-0246-z&atitle=Early+versus+late+start+of+open+kinetic+chain+quadriceps+exercises+after+ACL+reconstruction+with+patellar+tendon+or+hamstring+grafts%3A+A+prospective+randomized+outcome+study&stitle=Knee+Surg.+Sports+Traumatol.+Arthroscopy&title=Knee+Surgery%2C+Sports+Traumatology%2C+Arthroscopy&volume=15&issue=4&spage=402&epage=414&aulast=Heijne&aufirst=Annette&auinit=A.&aufull=Heijne+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=402-414&date=2007&auinit1=A&auinitm=,MEDLINE® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Methods: 1 A total of 32 inpatients (19 males and 13 females) who signed informed consents and underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction at the Department of Knee Joint, Sichuan Provincial Orthopaedic Hospital were randomly divided into two groups (A, B) by single blind method, 16 patients in each. 2 In group A, the patients accepted TCM combining rehabilitation training. On the operation day, routine rehabilitation training was conducted in toes, ankle joint and quadriceps femoris contraction, continuously until post-operative half a year, and the intensity increased with the time extended. Between 8 hours and 7 weeks post-operative, TCM treatment was performed along with rehabilitation training: The patients administrated orally knee injury prescription 1# (coptis root, baikal skullcap root, dandelion, achyranthes root, common turmeric root and rhubarb), one preparation daily and three times taken, during 8 hours and 2-4 days post-operative. On post-operative 2 days, finger massage was done in Zusanli (ST 36), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6), 15 seconds for each acupoint, 10 minutes daily. On post-operative 3 days, the finger massage and electro-acupuncture (EA, 80 times per minute) was conducted alternatively in Zusanli (ST 36), Yinglingquan (GB 34) and Yinlingquan (SP 9). On post-operative 4 days, finger massage was performed in Zusanli (ST 36), Yanglingquan (GB 34), Yinlingquan (SP 9), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Chengshan (BL 57) along with the same EA treatment as above. During the post-operative 5-11 days, the patients administrated orally knee injury prescription 2# (peach seed, Chinese angelica, red peony root, medicinal cyathula root, akebia stem, teasel root, common bletilla tuber, nutgrass galingale rhizome and coptis root), one preparation taken by three times daily, continuously for 7 days, meanwhile the finger massage and EA treatment was done same as above. From the post-operative 12 days, the patients administrated orally knee injury prescription 2# (membranous milkvetch root, tangshen, earth-worm, akabia stem, desertliving cistanche, dodder seed, Chinese taxillue twig, obscured homalomena rhizome and flowering quince fruit), one preparation taken by three times daily. Meanwhile the finger massage and EA treatment was done same as above. At post-operative 4-7 weeks, TCM was given symptomatically combining with finger massage. At post-operative 8-12 weeks, exercise muscle power was strengthened. During post-operative 12 weeks and 6 months, all the functions recovered. In group B: The patients accepted only rehabilitation training after operation, identically as above. 3 At pre-operation, and 3, 7, 14 days and 3 months after operation, the pain at rest and activity were evaluated quantifiedly by visual analogue scale (VAS), indolent as 0 and server painful as 10.0. 4 At post-operative 3, 4 and 17 days, the swelling was detected with knee joint cavity puncture and fluid extracts. 5 At pre-operation, and post-operative 7, 14 days and 3 months, the range of motion (ROM) was measured with joint angle finder. At pre-operation and 3 months after operation, knee joint function was assayed with Lysholm scale by interrogative mode (totally 100 scores, and the higher score indicated the better knee function). 6 The symptom, knee joint function and motor function of patients were detected with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)-2000 scale (integral score method, 1 on behalf of minimum level of function or most severe symptom, and the higher score implied the better function and the slighter symptom). 7 The difference of measurement data were compared with t test. Results: Totally 32 patients of ACL reconstruction were involved into the result analysis. 1 At post-operative 3 and 7 days, the pain levels of patients at rest and activity in group A were obviously lower than group B (P < 0.05), especially at post-operative 14 days, the pain at activity obviously decreased (P < 0.05). 2 At post-operative 7 days and 3 months, ROM in group A was prior to that of group B (P < 0.05). 3 The difference of the knee swelling at the 3, 7 and 14 days after operation was not significant between two groups (P > 0.05). 4 The scores of knee joint function were markedly higher at 3 months after operation than at pre-operation, and also markedly higher in group A than in group B (P < 0.05), 5 There was insignificant difference in the scores of IKDC-2000 scale between two groups at pre-operation and post-operative 3 months (P > 0.05).

Material and methods: A consecutive series of 100 patients with grade II (Noyes classification) chronic anterior laxity confirmed on stress x-rays were included in the study. All patients had a positive Trillat-Lachman test, a direct anterior drawer at 90° flexion confirmed on the lateral x-ray, and an instrumental differential laxity greater than 5 mm (manual arthrometry, Medmetric KT1000). Mean patient age was 27 years (range 16-29 years) and time from the accident to ligamentoplasty was 29 months (range 3-156 months). In the operating theater, the patients were assigned at random to two groups. Group 1 (50 patients) underwent arthroscopic free patellar tendon-bone autograft reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. In the second group (50 patients) the same reconstruction was further supported by a lateral extra-articular plasty using the quadriceps tendon. All patients were followed prospectively. At 58 months follow-up (none of the patients were lost to follow-up) residual laxity (Medmetric KT1000) was noted and functional outcome was assessed using the IKDC criteria. The Aglietti method was used to assess the position of the drill holes. Results: The two groups were strictly identical at inclusion. At last follow-up, the statistical analysis did not reveal any significant difference between the groups for subjective outcome, joint motion, instrumental residual laxity, meniscal stock, or radiological changes. The overall IKDC score was A or B in 80% of the patients in group 1 and 88% of the patients in group 2. Delay to resumed sports activities (about 12 months) was also equivalent in the two groups with a trend towards lower intensity and sports producing less stress on the knee. A minimally positive pivot test with no effect on stability was observed in 4 patients in group 1 (intra-articular plasty alone) and in 2 patients in group 2 (intra- and extra-articular plasty). 16% of the insufficient results (IKDC C and D) were related to repeated tears (n = 8, 6 patients in group 1 and 2 patients in group 2, p = 0.268), and failure (n = 8, 4 in each group) due to defective motion and pain. Repeated tears were strongly correlated with incorrect drill hole position in the tibia (p = 0.01) or femur (p = 0.024). Despite the stabilization, radiological remodeling was observed in 31% of the patients in both groups. Discussion: The results in this consecutive series of patients demonstrated the good results obtained with intra-articular ligamentoplasy using the mid third of the patellar tendon. The rate of repeated tears or minimally positive pivot tests was higher in group 1 with intra-articular plasty alone but did not reach statistical significance and was generally related to a technical error in positioning the autograft, making it difficult to draw any conclusion concerning the anatomic superiority of mixed plasty.

Fifty patients, undergoing an ACL reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, were postoperatively allocated randomly to either a plaster cast or a brace for 5 weeks. The brace group had ROM exercises from postoperative day 7. The commencement of ROM exercises was postponed 4 weeks for the plaster group compared to the brace group, but progressed subsequently with equal speed. There was no difference between the groups in the ROM of flexion or extension 20 weeks after the ACL reconstruction and later. Twenty-four months after surgery, the muscle strength deficit in the hamstring muscles (isokinetic measurements; percent difference, injured vs uninjured) was significantly larger in the brace group (mean +/- SD: 5.9 +/- 7.8%, P < 0.01) than in the plaster group (- 0.9 +/- 11.8%, NS) (brace vs plaster group, P < 0.05). Furthermore, there was also a tendency in the brace group to a larger strength deficit in the quadriceps muscle (brace: 11.1 +/- 13.2%, P < 0.001; plaster: 3.8 +/- 12.9%, NS) (brace vs plaster group, P= 0.07). There was no difference between the groups in the total sagittal knee laxity, as measured with an arthrometer, or in the subjective knee function or activity level (Lysholm score together with the Tegner activity level) between the groups. It is concluded that the postoperative treatment with early range of motion training after ACL reconstruction gave as good ROM, knee stability, subjective knee function and activity level as the treatment with immobilization.

We studied anterior knee laxity, thigh muscle torque, and return to preinjury sports level in 44 patients with unilateral ACL; group 1 carried out quadriceps strengthening only with CKC while group 2 trained with CKC plus OKC exercises starting from week 6 after surgery. Anterior knee laxity was determined with a KT-1000 arthrometer; isokinetic concentric and eccentric quadriceps and hamstring muscle torque were studied with a Kin-Com dynamometer before and 6 months after surgery. At an average of 31 months after surgery the patients answered a questionnaire regarding their current knee function and physical activity/sports to determine the extent and timing of their recovery. No significant differences in anterior knee laxity were noted between the groups 6 months postsurgery. Patients in group 2 increased their quadriceps torque significantly more than those in group 1, but no differences were found in hamstring torque between the groups.

Exercises in water have been shown to be effective for improving strength and passive range of motion (PROM). Traditional rehabilitation following intra-articular anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has taken place on land. This study was designed to compare the effects of exercises in water on strength and girth of the thigh musculature, knee PROM, joint laxity, effusion, and functional outcome with the effects of similar exercises on land in subjects following intra- articular reconstruction of the ACL. Subjects. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to either a group that exercised on land or a group that exercised in water. Methods. Thigh girth, joint effusion, and knee PROM measurements were recorded at 2-week intervals for the first 8 weeks post-operatively. Isokinetic and isometric peak torque measurements for the thigh musculature, knee joint laxity assessments, and Lysholm scores were obtained at the end of 8 weeks. Results. Higher outcome scores were recorded in the water group than in the land group, as measured by Lysholm scales. No differences were noted between groups for knee PROM, thigh girth, or quadriceps femoris muscle performance. In the water group, less joint effusion was noted after the 8 weeks. In the land group, greater peak torque for isokinetic knee flexion was recorded. Conclusion and Discussion. Although exercise in water may not be as effective as exercise on land for regaining maximum muscle performance, rehabilitation in water may minimize the amount of joint effusion and lead to greater self-reports of functional improvement in subjects with intra- articular ACL reconstructions.",,,,English,English,1994251161,8047560,L24245113,10.1093/ptj/74.8.710,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ptj/74.8.710,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L24245113&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=00319023&id=doi:10.1093%2Fptj%2F74.8.710&atitle=Comparison+of+the+effects+of+exercise+in+water+and+on+land+on+the+rehabilitation+of+patients+with+intra-articular+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstructions&stitle=PHYS.+THER.&title=Physical+Therapy&volume=74&issue=8&spage=710&epage=719&aulast=Tovin&aufirst=B.J.&auinit=B.J.&aufull=Tovin+B.J.&coden=PTHEA&isbn=&pages=710-719&date=1994&auinit1=B&auinitm=J,"Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

All patients had their full extent of injury mapped out at arthroscopy. We believe that arthroscopy before treatment for a torn anterior cruciate ligament injury is necessary in order to treat meniscus lesions that could interfere with the rehabilitation. In this study, 16 patients were unstable with a positive pivot-shift, and 16 patients were operated on and thus stable. All patients performed a performance test with and without the brace in a randomized order. Before the start of the investigation, we postulated that patients with a quadriceps atrophy who were unstable would improve their function with the derotation brace. We could not find any effects of the brace in this study. The brace did not significantly improve function in the group of patients who were unstable with a quadriceps atrophy. On the other hand, the brace did not impair function in the patients. We conclude that to be able to improve knee function in the unstable knee, other modes of treatment than bracing are necessary. Bracing should be seen as a complement to these other treatments.",,,,English,,1986040382,4096777,L16231321,10.1016/S0749-8063(85)80095-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0749-8063(85)80095-5,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L16231321&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=07498063&id=doi:10.1016%2FS0749-8063%2885%2980095-5&atitle=Derotation+brace+and+knee+function+in+patients+with+anterior+cruciate+ligament+tears&stitle=ARTHROSCOPY&title=Arthroscopy&volume=1&issue=4&spage=264&epage=267&aulast=Tegner&aufirst=Y.&auinit=Y.&aufull=Tegner+Y.&coden=ARTHE&isbn=&pages=264-267&date=1985&auinit1=Y&auinitm=,"Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Within 18.2 months of operation, 95% of the patients in Group I and 11% of those in Group II had a stable knee. The mean knee function score in Group I was 89 points, and 75% achieved more than 84 points (good or excellent). In Group II the mean score was 85; only 53% achieved more than 84 points (p < .05). Group II patients showed greater mean quadriceps strength than those in Group I. The ability to perform a one-leg jump and to run a figure eight was similar in both groups. Early primary suture of the acutely torn ACL usually resulted in a stable knee, whereas conservatively treated patients showed knee instability. At the 18-month inverval, however, the patients' functional performance seemed to be comparable in the two groups.",,,,English,,,3896609,L16248247,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L16248247&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=0009921X&id=doi:&atitle=Surgical+or+conservative+treatment+of+the+acutely+torn+anterior+cruciate+ligament.+A+randomized+study+with+short-term+follow-up+observations&stitle=CLIN.+ORTHOP.+RELAT.+RES.&title=Clinical+Orthopaedics+and+Related+Research&volume=198&issue=&spage=87&epage=93&aulast=Odensten&aufirst=M.&auinit=M.&aufull=Odensten+M.&coden=CORTB&isbn=&pages=87-93&date=1985&auinit1=M&auinitm=,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
