Biomimetic electrospun nanomaterials present promising avenues for improving this critical healing process. Purpose: To investigate the biological efficacy of a novel aligned-to-random PLGA/Col1-PLGA/nHA bilayer electrospun nanofiber membrane in facilitating tendon-to-bone healing. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The bilayer membrane’s composition, combining PLGA/Col1 for tendon attachment and PLGA/nHA for bone integration, was examined using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and mechanical testing. Positioned between the Achilles tendon and bone, its design aimed for harmonious integration with both types of tissue. In vitro, biocompatibility, cell adhesion, and proliferation of the biomaterial were evaluated using live/dead staining and the CCK-8 assay. Collagen secretion and mineralization were measured for 2 cell types. In vivo, tendon-to-bone insertion samples harvested from mice were analyzed: micro–computed tomography assessed bone formation; histological staining evaluated chondrogenesis, tendinogenesis, and the 4-layer structure of the insertion; and biomechanical testing measured insertion strength. Real-time polymerase chain reaction identified genes involved in tendon-to-bone healing, and transcriptome analysis elucidated the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Results: The optimal composition was determined as 10% 3:1 for aligned PLGA/Col1 and 9% 5:1 for PLGA/nHA. Coculture showed minimal cell death, firm cell adherence, and steady proliferation, with PLGA/Col1 enhancing collagen secretion. In vivo, the material promoted bone and cartilage formation and improved tendon-to-bone interface strength. Transcriptome analysis indicated links to TNF and NF-κB pathways and to genes IL-1β, ADAM8, and EGR2. Conclusion: The novel aligned-to-random PLGA/Col1-PLGA/nHA bilayer nanofiber membrane outperformed other materials in both in vitro and in vivo evaluations, significantly enhancing tendon-to-bone healing. It notably improved cartilage and bone formation, tendon maturation, and biomechanical strength at the surgical interface. These effects may be associated with the TNF and NF-κB pathways and with the genes IL-1β, ADAM8, and EGR2. Clinical Relevance: This study introduces a biomimetic nanofiber membrane enhancing tendon-to-bone healing, which is crucial for sports medicine. Its efficacy in improving healing outcomes, including bone and cartilage formation and biomechanical strength, could significantly lower failure rates in surgical procedures such as rotator cuff repair and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. This advancement offers promising implications for patient recovery and the effectiveness of surgical interventions in tendon-to-bone injuries. © 2025 The Author(s).","aligned PLGA/Col1-PLGA/nHA; collagen; nHA; PLGA; tendon-to-bone healing","biomaterial; collagen type 1; nanofiber; polyglactin; achilles tendon; animal; bone; bone development; cell proliferation; chemistry; drug effect; injury; male; mouse; tendon injury; tissue scaffold; wound healing; Achilles Tendon; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Bone and Bones; Cell Proliferation; Collagen Type I; Male; Mice; Nanofibers; Osteogenesis; Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer; Tendon Injuries; Tissue Scaffolds; Wound Healing","","polyglactin, 26780-50-7, 34346-01-5; Biocompatible Materials; Collagen Type I; Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82130071, 82102633); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality, (cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0137); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality","One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82130071 and No. 82102633) and the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0137).

All known human genes were assessed through the model to identify potential new risk genes for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures and Achilles tendinopathy (AT). Genes were prioritised and explored in a case–control study comparing participants with ACL ruptures (ACL-R), including a sub-group with non-contact mechanism injuries (ACL-NON), to uninjured control individuals (CON). After gene filtering, 3376 genes, including 411 genes identified through previous whole exome sequencing, were found to be potentially linked to AT and ACL ruptures. Four variants were prioritised: HSPG2:rs2291826A/G, HSPG2:rs2291827G/A, ITGB2:rs2230528C/T and FGF9:rs2274296C/T. The rs2230528 CC genotype was over-represented in the CON group compared to ACL-R (p < 0.001) and ACL-NON (p < 0.001) and the TT genotype and T allele were over-represented in the ACL-R group and ACL-NON compared to CON (p < 0.001) group. Several significant differences in distributions were noted for the gene-gene interactions: (HSPG2:rs2291826, rs2291827 and ITGB2:rs2230528) and (ITGB2:rs2230528 and FGF9:rs2297429). This study substantiates the efficiency of using a prior knowledge-driven in silico approach to identify candidate genes linked to tendon and ACL injuries. Our biomedical knowledge graph identified and, with further testing, highlighted novel associations of the ITGB2 gene which has not been explored in a genetic case control association study, with ACL rupture risk. We thus recommend a multistep approach including bioinformatics in conjunction with next generation sequencing technology to improve the discovery potential of genomics technologies in musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. Highlights A biomedical knowledge graph was modelled for musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries to efficiently identify candidate genes for genetic susceptibility analyses. The biomedical knowledge graph and sequencing data identified potential biologically relevant variants to explore susceptibility to common tendon and ligament injuries. Specifically genetic variants within the ITGB2 and FGF9 genes were associated with ACL risk. Novel allele combinations (HSPG2-ITGB2 and ITGB2-FGF9) showcase the potential effect of ITGB2 in influencing risk of ACL rupture. © 2023 European College of Sport Science.","anterior cruciate ligament; Fibroblast Growth Factor 9; Heparan sulfate proteoglycan; Integrin β2 subunit; Semantic modelling; whole exome sequencing","FGF9 protein, human; fibroblast growth factor 9; achilles tendon; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; case control study; gene locus; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; rupture; tendinitis; Achilles Tendon; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Case-Control Studies; Fibroblast Growth Factor 9; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Rupture; Tendinopathy","","fibroblast growth factor 9, 151185-16-9; FGF9 protein, human; Fibroblast Growth Factor 9","","","University of Cape Town, UCT; National Research Foundation, NRF, (90552, NRF 88177); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (690850); European Commission, EC, (H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015–690850); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST, (NRF 92550)","This research was supported in part by funds received from the National Research Foundation (NRF) [grant number NRF 90552 and NRF 88177], the University of Cape Town (UCT) Research Council and the Department of Science and Technology [grant number NRF 92550].

Methods: The clinical data of 12 patients with Fanelli type C chronic PLC injury with severe posterolateral knee instability who met the selection criteria between June 2013 and August 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 9 males and 3 females, with a median age of 34.5 years (range, 18-57 years). The average time from injury to surgery was 10.5 months (range, 3-24 months). All of them were multi-ligament injuries and were treated with anatomical reconstruction of Y-shaped allogeneic Achilles tendon. The posterior and varus stress X-ray films were used to measure and calculate the difference of posterior displacement of tibia and difference of lateral joint opening distance between bilateral knees to evaluate the backward stability of LCL and knee joint; the knee flexion 30° tibial external rotation test was used to calculate the difference of tibial external rotation angle between bilateral knees to evaluate the stability of knee external rotation. The knee function was evaluated by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective and objective scores. Results: The operation successfully completed in 12 patients, and there was no vascular and nerve injury during operation. The operation time was 2.5-3.5 hours, with an average of 2.7 hours; the intraoperative blood loss was 20-100 mL, with an average of 55 mL. All patients were followed up 13-41 months, with an average of 28.1 months. At last follow-up, the difference of posterior displacement of tibia, the difference of lateral joint opening, the difference of tibial external rotation angle between bilateral knees, and the IKDC2000 subjective score, the objective scores of tibial external rotation and knee varus significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). The knee joint of 1 patient with anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and PLC reconstruction was stiff at 15 months after operation, and the range of motion of the knee joint was 10°-80°. After arthroscopic release, the range of motion of the knee joint was 5°-120°, the reconstructed ligament was stable. In the other patients, the knee flexion angle was normal in 2 cases; 9 cases had knee flexion limitation of 5°-10°, with an average of 6.4°; no knee extension was limited. Conclusion: Anatomical PLC reconstruction using Y-shaped allogeneic Achilles tendon can effectively treat Fanelli type C chronic PLC injury with severe posterolateral knee instability and improve the knee joint stability.","allogeneic Achilles tendon; anatomical reconstruction; lateral collateral ligament; popliteofibular ligament; Posterolateral complex","achilles tendon; adolescent; adult; diagnostic imaging; female; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; male; middle aged; posterior cruciate ligament; reconstructive surgery; retrospective study; treatment outcome; young adult; Achilles Tendon; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","10021892","","","35038796","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123812519"

Repair of the ACL often requires the use of autografts or allografts, and the RN first assistant (RNFA) often is the team member responsible for preparing the graft. Common grafts used in ACL repair include bone-patellar tendon-bone, hamstring, Achilles tendon, quadriceps tendon, and tibialis anterior tendon. The RNFA must be competent in preparing all of these grafts and in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using each graft, such as the reasons for graft choice, and must ensure that all graft-related supplies and equipment are available and ready for use. The ability to prepare all graft types expands treatment options, reduces surgical time, and enhances the role of the RNFA. © 2014 AORN, Inc.","ACL; ACL reconstruction; Allograft; Anterior cruciate ligament; Autograft; RN first assistant; RNFA","anterior cruciate ligament; human; injuries; orthopedic surgery; perioperative nursing; surgery; transplantation; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Humans; Orthopedic Procedures; Perioperative Nursing","","","","","","","Aaos Now, (2007); Bourke, Henry E., Survival of the anterior cruciate ligament graft and the contralateral ACL at a minimum of 15 years, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, 9, pp. 1985-1992, (2012); AORN Position Statement on RN First Assistants, (2014); Assisting in Surgery Patient Centered Care, (2009); Alexander S Care of the Patient in Surgery, (2011); Unwin, Andrew, (iii) What's new in anterior cruciate ligament surgery?, Orthopaedics and Trauma, 24, 2, pp. 100-106, (2010); undefined, (2014); Acl Surgery how to Get It Right the First Time and What to do if Itfails, (2010); Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment, (2006); Dempsey, Alasdair R., Changing sidestep cutting technique reduces knee valgus loading, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 37, 11, pp. 2194-2200, (2009)","","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00012092","","","25443120","English","AORN J.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908150663"

This assessment was to be performed with a new method using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a digital imaging system. Methods: In this prospective randomized comparative study, 53 young male patients with ACL rupture underwent ACL reconstruction with the transtibial technique (group 1) or the anteromedial portal technique (group 2). We assessed clinical outcomes with the Lachman test, pivot shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) classification, Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and single leg hop (SLH) test. Radiologic assessments included the position of the femoral tunnel aperture and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) index on conventional MRI and the side-to-side difference (SSD) on stress radiographs. Results: Sixty-one participants had follow-up. The mean follow-up period was 30.2 months. At the last follow-up, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in results from the Lachman test, pivot shift test, IKDC classification, Tegner activity scale, and SLH test. The Lysholm score and SSD results in group 2 were superior to those in group 1 (P <.001). The femoral tunnel aperture was positioned more posteriorly in group 2 than in group 1 (P <.001). Changes in the PCL index were greater in group 1 than in group 2 (P <.001). Conclusions: The position of the femoral tunnel aperture created with the anteromedial portal technique was more posterior than that made with the transtibial technique. Knees reconstructed with the anteromedial portal technique were more stable in Telos testing, and were 3 points higher on the Lysholm score. However, there were no statistically significant differences in the Tegner activity scale or IKDC classification between the 2 groups.

The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of histology and biomechanics on Achilles tendon in rabbits through repeated freezing-thawing before allograft tendon transplantation. Rabbit Achilles tendons were harvested and processed according to the manufacture's protocol of tissue bank, and freezing-thawing was repeated three times (group 1) and ten times (group 2). Those received only one cycle were used as controls. Then, tendons in each group were selected randomly to make for histological observations and biomechanics test. Histological observation showed that the following changes happened as the number of freezing-thawing increased: the arrangement of tendon bundles and collagen fibrils became disordered until ruptured, cells disrupted and apparent gaps appeared between tendon bundle because the formation of ice crystals. There were significant differences between the experimental and control groups in the values of maximum load, energy of maximum load and maximum stress, whereas no significant differences existed in other values such as stiffness, maximum strain, elastic modulus, and energy density. Therefore, repeated freezing-thawing had histological and biomechanical effect on Achilles tendon in rabbits before allograft tendon transplantation.

METHODS: A total of 513 patients with ACL injury treated with arthroscopic allogenic ACL reconstruction were selected from February 1999 to January 2008. They consisted of 324 males and 189 females, with an average age of 29 years. There were 272 cases of allogenic bone-patellar tendon-bone, 208 cases of allogenic anterior tibialis tendon, 13 cases of allogenic rectus femoris tendon, 8 cases of allogenic flexor tendon, and 12 cases of allogenic achilles tendon-bone. The function of knee joint was assessed by Lysholm knee score and IKDC score before and after transplantation. The stability and the range of motion of knee joint were assessed by Lachman test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000 testing. RESULTS: A 12-76 months follow-up was obtained. The Lyshrolm score before transplantation was significantly higher than that after transplantation (P < 0.01). The excellent and good rate of IKDC score was 92% after transplantation. Among the patients, 458 (89.2%) patients were Lachman test negative, and 462 (90%) patients were pivot shift test negative. The anterior shift of tibia after transplantation were significantly shorter than that before transplantation (P < 0.01). Some of the patients suffered from fever, and they were complete recovery after common symptomatic treatment. The rejections appeared in some patients, and they were cured after hormones treatment. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein increased in 58 cases for 2-3 days after transplantation, and dropped to normal for 14-30 days. The total activated lymphocytes and the mid-activated lymphocytes were not significantly increased in all patients. The flexor tendon allografts were stretched under arthroscopy in 2 patients. 1 patient was treated with electrothermal shrinkage, and the other patient was treated with ACL revision surgery and ACL LARS-artificial ligament reconstruction. The second operation in other patients showed that the ligaments firmly healed with good tension. Their surfaces covered with synovial membranes, and small vessels grew in them. The active bleeding of the synovial membrane could be seen after little debridement CONCLUSION: A middle- and long-term follow-up shows that the arthroscopic allogenic transplantation for ACL reconstruction has the satisfied clinical efficacy with safety.","","C reactive protein; achilles tendon; adult; allogenic ligament transplantation; allotransplantation; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior tibialis tendon; arthroscopic surgery; article; bleeding; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical assessment; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; fever; flexor tendon; follow up; functional assessment; graft rejection; hormonal therapy; human; knee function; lachman test; ligament; lymphocyte; Lysholm knee score; major clinical study; male; pivot shift test; range of motion; rectus femoris tendon; reoperation; safety; synovium; tension; tibia; treatment failure; treatment outcome","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); O'Neill, Daniel B., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A prospective randomized analysis of three techniques, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 78, 6, pp. 803-813, (1996); Prokopis, Peter M., Allograft use in ACL reconstruction, Knee, 6, 2, pp. 75-85, (1999); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Donor-site morbidity and anterior knee problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autografts, Arthroscopy, 17, 9, pp. 971-980, (2001); Thillemann, Janni Kjærgaard, Sensibility loss after ACL reconstruction with hamstring graft, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 507-511, (2008); McCarroll, John R., Fracture of the patella during a golf swing following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A case report, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 11, 1, pp. 26-27, (1983); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

It is not clear whether this potential reduction in muscle strength is progressive and related to the duration from the injury to ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible effect of the period from the injury to surgery on pre and postoperative outcomes of isokinetic muscle performance and laxity of knee in patients with anterior ACL deficiency. Patients and methods: Clinical and isokinetic assessments of 98 patients with ACL injury were evaluated preoperatively. Patients had appropriate surgical intervention with allograft achilles tendon, autograft quadriceps tendon and auto or allograft bone patellar tendon bone reconstructions. After surgery a standard rehabilitation program, accelerated rehabilitation protocol of Shelbourne, was programmed for patients. The time from the initial injury to surgery was determined and the patients were divided into groups according to the period from the injury to surgical intervention; group 1: surgery within 12 months and group 2: surgery more than 12 months. Group 2 was also subdivided into two groups group 2A: surgery within 12-36 months and group 2B: surgery more than 36 months from the injury. Also the postoperative outcomes of patients were assessed prospectively in the main groups as group 1 and 2. Isokinetic performance and KT- 1000 assessments were evaluated 1 week before and 2, 4, 6, 12 months after ACL reconstruction. All measurements were evaluated both in injured and uninjured legs and healthy legs were considered as controls. These differences between preoperative three groups were analyzed by performing one-way ANOVA and independent samples t test was used to compare the data between postoperative two groups. Results: 98 patients were included in our study. In arthrometer measurements, no significant difference was determined between groups except in KT 1000 tests between group 1 and group 2B preoperatively (p < 0.05). Also there was no significant difference between groups in flexion isokinetic performance. Preoperatively, in group 1, the difference between healthy and injured leg in extension measurements of peak torque, total work and endurance ratio was significantly lower than both group 2A and group B (p < 0.05). However preoperative analysis of group 2A and group 2B showed that these parameters did not differ significantly when surgery was performed within 12-36 months or more than 36 months from the injury. In the comparisons of groups postoperatively, lower values in these parameters on 2nd month and in endurance on 4th month remained significant after reconstruction in group 1 (p < 0.05). After 6 and 12 months, statistical significance did not remained between groups in spite of some higher deficits in lately operated patients. Conclusion: Reconstruction of ACL carried out within 12 months from the injury can minimize the strength deficit in isokinetic evaluations. Satisfactory results in isokinetic muscle performance can be achieved even with late reconstruction with appropriate rehabilitation involving especially quadriceps strengthening exercises. © 2008 IOS Press.

Seven patients were treated with a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft for the ACL reconstruction and an Achilles allograft for the PCL reconstruction, three patients with ipsilateral/contralateral BPTB autografts, and one patient with BPTB allograft for ACL and Achilles allograft for PCL. Seven patients were operated on acutely (<3 months postinjury), and 4 were treated for chronic conditions. At follow-up, all patients were subjectively and functionally evaluated with a Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. Average patient age at surgery was 29 years, and average postoperative follow-up was 28.4 months. Average postoperative Lysholm score was 87.7 (range: 49-100). Four of 11 patients reported occasional mild pain, 2 occasional swelling, and 4 infrequent instability. No patient required a postoperative manipulation to regain his or her range of motion and 10 of the 11 returned to their previous activity level postoperatively. Of the 10 patients able to return for clinical examination, 2 demonstrated a loss of flexion <5 degrees compared to the other side, 7 demonstrated a mild postoperative posterior drawer at 90 degrees (6 at 1+, 1 at 2+), 3 demonstrated a positive Lachman (grade 1), whereas no patient demonstrated any posterior lateral corner instability. The average anterior active difference on KT-1000 was 2.6 (range: 0-6). Simultaneous reconstruction of the ACL and PCL, although technically difficult, is feasible and yields good to excellent functional results.","","anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; human; injury; knee injury; knee ligament; methodology; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Humans; Knee Injuries; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15388506","","","14584830","English","J Knee Surg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1542780749"

Type of Study: Case series. Methods: This study population included 26 men and 9 women with 19 acute and 16 chronic knee injuries. Ligament injuries included 19 ACL/PCL/posterolateral instabilities, 9 ACL/PCL/medial cruciate ligament (MCL) instabilities, 6 ACL/PCL/posterolateral/MCL instabilities, and 1 ACL/PCL instability. All knees had grade III preoperative ACL/PCL laxity and were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively with arthrometer testing, 3 different knee ligament rating scales, stress radiography, and physical examination. Arthroscopically assisted combined ACL/PCL reconstructions were performed using the single-incision endoscopic ACL technique and the single femoral tunnel-single bundle transtibial tunnel PCL technique. PCLs were reconstructed with allograft Achilles tendon (in 26 cases), autograft bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) (in 7 cases), and autograft semitendinosus/gracilis (in 2 cases). ACLs were reconstructed with autograft BPTB (16 cases), allograft BPTB (12 cases), Achilles tendon allograft (6 cases), and autograft semitendinosus/gracilis (1 case). MCL injuries were treated with bracing or open reconstruction. Posterolateral instability was treated with biceps femoris tendon transfer, with or without primary repair, and posterolateral capsular shift procedures as indicated. Results: Postoperative physical examination revealed normal posterior drawer/tibial step-off in 16 of 35 (46%) knees. Normal Lackman and pivot-shift test results were found in 33 of 35 (94%) knees. Posterolateral stability was restored to normal in 6 of 25 (24%) knees, and tighter than normal knee results were found in 19 of 25 (76%) knees evaluated with the external rotation thigh foot angle test. In this group, 30° varus stress testing was normal in 22 of 25 (88%) knees, and grade 1 laxity was found in 3 of 25 (12%) knees. 30° valgus stress testing was normal in 7 of 7 (100%) surgically treated MCL tears, and in 7 of 8 (87.5%) brace-treated knees. Postoperative KT-1000 arthrometer testing mean side-to-side difference measurements were 2.7 mm (PCL screen), 2.6 mm (corrected posterior), and 1.0 mm (corrected anterior) measurements, a statistically significant improvement from preoperative status (P = .001). Postoperative stress radiographic side-to-side difference measurements measured at 90° of knee flexion and 32 lb posteriorly directed proximal force were 0 to 3 mm in 11 of 21 (52.3%) knees, 4 to 5 mm in 5 of 21 (23.8%), and 6 to 10 mm in 4 of 21 (19%) knees. Postoperative Lysholm, Tegner, and HSS knee ligament rating scale mean values were 91.2, 5.3, and 86.8, respectively, showing a statistically significant improvement from preoperative status (P = .001). Conclusions: Combined ACL/PCL instabilities can be successfully treated with arthroscopic reconstruction and the appropriate collateral ligament surgery. Statistically significant improvement is noted from the preoperative condition at 2- to 10-year follow-up using objective parameters of knee ligament rating scales, arthrometer testing, stress radiography, and physical examination. Postoperatively, these knees are not normal, but they are functionally stable. Continuing technical improvements will probably improve future results.","Allograft; Biceps tendon transfer; Combined ACL/PCL reconstruction; Multiple ligament injured knee","achilles tendon; article; autograft; bone stress; clinical article; evaluation; female; follow up; functional assessment; hospital for special surgery knee ligament rating scale; human; knee arthroscopy; knee ligament injury; knee radiography; kt 1000 arthrometer testing; ligament surgery; lysholm score; male; measurement; physical examination; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; rating scale; scoring system; statistical significance; surgical approach; surgical technique; tegner score; tendon graft","","","","","","","Fanelli, Gregory C., Posterior cruciate ligament injuries in trauma patients, Arthroscopy, 9, 3, pp. 291-294, (1993); Fanelli, Gregory C., Posterior cruciate ligament injuries in trauma patients: Part II, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 5, pp. 526-529, (1995); Fanelli, Gregory C., Arthroscopically assisted combined posterior cruciate ligament/posterior lateral complex reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 12, 5, pp. 521-530, (1996); Tegner, Yelverton, Rating systems in the evaluation of knee ligament injuries, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 198, pp. 43-49, (1985); Am J Knee Surg, (1988); Knee Ligaments Structure Function Injury and Repair, (1990); Fanelli, Gregory C., The posterior cruciate ligament arthroscopic evaluation and treatment, Arthroscopy, 10, 6, pp. 673-688, (1994); Malek, Mehrdad M., Technique of arthroscopically assisted PCL reconstruction, Orthopedics, 16, 9, pp. 961-966, (1993); Techniques in Therapeutic Arthroscopy, (1993); Knee, (1994)","G.C.

Fifteen patients returned for reevaluation at an average of 25 months postoperatively (range, 12 to 60 months); the remaining four patients were interviewed by telephone. There were no significant leg-length discrepancies or angular deformities as determined by scanograms and anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the femur and tibia. The mean Lysholm knee score was 97 (range, 94 to 100) and the mean KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference at 20 pounds of anterior force was 1.7 mm (range, 0.0 to 3.0). All patients were satisfied with the results of surgery, and 16 of 19 patients returned to the same sport they were participating in before the injury.

There were 16 men or boys, 4 women or girls; 9 right, 11 left; 10 acute, and 10 chronic knee injuries. Ligament injuries included 1 ACL/ PCL tear, 2 ACL/PCL/medial collateral ligament (MCL)/posterior lateral corner tears, 7 ACL/PCL/MCL tears, and 10 ACL/PCL/posterior lateral corner tears. ACLs were reconstructed using autograft or allograft patellar tendons. PCLs were reconstructed using allograft Achilles tendon, or autograft patellar tendon. MCL tears were successfully treated with bracing. Posterior lateral instability was successfully treated with long head of the biceps femoris tendon tenodesis. Tegner, Lysholm, and Hospital for Special Surgery knee ligament rating scales significantly improved preoperatively to postoperatively (P = .0001). Corrected anterior KT 1000 measurements improved from preoperative to postoperative status (P = .0078). © 1996 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.","ACL; Biceps femoris tendon tenodesis; Combined ACL/PCL reconstruction; PCL","achilles tendon; adult; allograft; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; autograft; child; clinical article; female; human; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; knee ligament; knee ligament injury; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; postoperative care; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; surgical technique; tendon graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopes; Child; Endoscopes; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Fanelli, Gregory C., Posterior cruciate ligament injuries in trauma patients, Arthroscopy, 9, 3, pp. 291-294, (1993); Fanelli, Gregory C., Posterior cruciate ligament injuries in trauma patients: Part II, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 5, pp. 526-529, (1995); Am J Knee Surg, (1994); Taylor, A.
