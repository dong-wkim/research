In this retrospective study, patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with either PLT or HT grafts between 2015 and 2024 were analyzed. Postoperative follow-up data included muscle properties (tone-F, stiffness-S, elasticity-D) around the knee, International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores, and thigh circumference difference. For the PLT group, muscle properties (F, S, D) of ankle muscles (gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, tibialis anterior) and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scores were also assessed. Fifteen patients (average age 28 ± 9.83 years) were included. No significant differences were found between groups in knee muscle properties (F, S, D), International Knee Documentation Committee, or Lysholm scores (P > .05). However, thigh circumference reduction was significantly smaller in the PLT group (4.90 (4.00, 5.40)) compared to the HT group (3.45 (2.65, 4.33)) (P < .05). In the PLT group, ankle assessment revealed significant differences in elasticity (D) for the gastrocnemius and peroneus longus (P < .05) (gastrocnemius muscle: donor side [1.48 ± 0.04], healthy side [1.55 ± 0.02]; peroneus longus muscle: donor side [0.65 ± 0.27], healthy side [1.17 ± 0.03]), and in stiffness (S; donor side [391.60 ± 19.73], healthy side [433.60 ± 7.57]) and elasticity (D; donor side [1.07 ± 0.13], healthy side [1.41 ± 0.04]) for the tibialis anterior, with the healthy side showing superior values (P < .05). The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score was also significantly lower for the donor ankle side (92.20 ± 4.21) versus the healthy side (100.00 ± 0.00; P < .05). This study suggests that while both autologous PLT and HT grafts provide comparable postoperative knee function, the HT graft is associated with greater thigh muscle atrophy. The use of the PLT graft, however, leads to weakened muscle state and function around the donor ankle joint. Both grafts have distinct advantages and disadvantages, indicating that the choice should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances. © © 2026 the Author(s).

The technique involves using 2 reinforcements: one for anterolateral stabilization and the other for anteromedial stabilization. The procedure follows a detailed algorithm for diagnosing rotational instability through physical examination under anesthesia. This approach offers a solution for complex ACL injuries involving bidirectional rotational instability, aiming to optimize knee stability and reduce failure rates in ACL reconstruction. © 2025 The Authors","","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; articular surface; double extra articular reinforcement; graft harvesting; human; knee instability; patient positioning; peroneus longus muscle; physical examination; supine position; surgical technique","","","ACUFEX PINPOINT, Smith and Nephew; BIOSURE, Smith and Nephew","Smith and Nephew; Smith and Nephew","","","Video J Sports Med, (2024); Jorge, Pedro Baches, Positioning of the femoral tunnel in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Functional anatomical reconstruction, BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine, 4, 1, (2018); Jorge, Pedro Baches, Anterior Cruciate and Anterior Oblique Ligament Reconstruction Using Hamstrings and Peroneus Longus’ Anterior Half Grafts, Arthroscopy Techniques, 12, 6, pp. e861-e866, (2023); Ann Transl Med, (2019); Ueki, Hiroko, Risk factors for residual pivot shift after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: data from the MAKS group, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 26, 12, pp. 3724-3730, (2018); Kemler, Bryson R., Evaluation of Failed ACL Reconstruction: An Updated Review, Open Access Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, pp. 29-39, (2024); Jacquet, Christophe, Incidence and Risk Factors for Residual High-Grade Pivot Shift After ACL Reconstruction With or Without a Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis, Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 9, 5, (2021); Miyaji, Nobuaki, Medial Collateral Ligament Reconstruction for Anteromedial Instability of the Knee: A Biomechanical Study In Vitro, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 50, 7, pp. 1823-1831, (2022); Beel, Wouter, Load Sharing of the Deep and Superficial Medial Collateral Ligaments, the Effect of a Partial Superficial Medial Collateral Injury, and Implications on ACL Load, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 52, 8, pp. 1960-1969, (2024); Behrendt, Peter, The Control of Anteromedial Rotatory Instability Is Improved With Combined Flat sMCL and Anteromedial Reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 50, 8, pp. 2093-2101, (2022)","J.M.D. Malpaga; Sports Trauma Group, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, São Paulo, SP, Brazil; email: malepaga@gmail.com","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22126287","","","","English","Arthroscopy Tech.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216860571"

Study Design Dogs with partial CCL rupture that underwent a unilateral TPLO were included. The population was divided into two groups: remnant CCL transected (study group) and left in situ (control group). Preoperative and 6-week postoperative measurements of PLT, in three specific locations, and patellar ligament length (PLL) were collected. Risk factors for PLT and shortening were also included. Results Fifty-two dogs (56 stifles) with partial CCL rupture were retrospectively included. Twenty-nine stifles (51.8%) had the remnant CCL transected (study group) and 27 stifles (48.2%) had the remnant CCL left in situ (control group). Significant differences were found on PLT measurements between pre- and 6-week post-surgery for all three ligament locations with greatest difference at the middle region. Median PLL was significantly shorter 6-week post-surgery for both groups. No significant differences in PLT nor PLL were identified between procedures where the remnant was transected or not. Conclusion This study did not identify a protective effect of transecting the CCL remnant on PLT or patellar ligament shortening, contrary to other reports within the literature. Further investigation is needed in the form of prospective studies with higher number of cases to understand the clinical implications of patellar ligament thickening and shortening in dogs. © 2024 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Free grafts are avascular and theirs tibial side fixation insufficiency is a potential cause of failure in ACL reconstruction. Tibial attachment preserving hamstring graft preserves the vascularity and mechanical strength on the tibial side, and could be a viable option in an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, The authors describe the early outcome of the surgical technique of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with tibial attachment sparing hamstring graft without implant on the tibial side. Material and methods: The hamstring insertion preserving five stranded graft was used for ACL reconstruction with adjustable endobutton for femoral side fixation and no implant for tibial side fixation. Thirty-six patients with one-year follow-ups were included in the study. Results: The mean length of the prepared graft attached to the tibia was 95.5 ± 4 mm, and the mean width was 8.6 ± 0.7 mm and 8.2 ± 0.6 mm on the tibial and femoral side respectively. None had a failure of graft till the final follow-up. The preoperative International knee documentation committee score (IKDC) mean score improved from 47.3 ± 8.9 to 87.3 ± 6.7 at one-year follow-up. The preoperative Lysholm score (LS) improved from 58.1 ± 12.8 to 90.4 ± 4.9 at one-year follow-up. Conclusion: Attachment-sparing hamstring graft with a femoral side-only implant is a simple, cost-effective technique that provides a satisfactory outcome. © 2023 The Authors","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Femoral side fixation only; Hamstring graft; Tibial attachment preserving","","","","","","","","Janssen, Rob Paulus Augustinus, Intra-articular remodelling of hamstring tendon grafts after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 22, 9, pp. 2102-2108, (2014); Deehan, David John, The biology of intergration of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 87, 7, pp. 889-895, (2005); Sinha, Skand, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with tibial attachment preserving hamstring graft without implant on tibial side, Indian Journal of Orthopaedics, 52, 2, pp. 170-176, (2018); Papachristou, Georgios K., ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus tendon autograft without detachment of its tibial insertion: A histologic study in a rabbit model, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 15, 10, pp. 1175-1180, (2007); Löcherbach, Claus, Biologically enhanced ACL reconstruction, Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research, 96, 7, pp. 810-815, (2010); Lee, Byung-ill, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the tibial-remnant preserving technique using a hamstring graft, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 3, pp. 340-340.e7, (2006); Wagih, Ahmad M., Anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using in situ hamstring graft with 4 tunnels, Arthroscopy Techniques, 3, 1, pp. e49-e56, (2014); Buda, Roberto, Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using distally inserted doubled hamstrings tendons, Orthopedics, 36, 6, pp. 449-453, (2013); RUFFILLI, A., Hamstring graft tibial insertion preservation versus detachment in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective randomized comparative study, European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, 26, 6, pp. 657-664, (2016); Salman Ali, M., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon graft without detachment of the tibial insertion, Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, 126, 9, pp. 644-648, (2006)","V.

The advantages of percutaneous LCL reconstruction include small incisions, minimal soft tissue disruption, less postoperative pain, and speedy rehabilitation and recovery. The aim of this study was to report the functional outcome of percutaneous LCL reconstruction and overall patient satisfaction in Africans. Methods: This prospective and interventional study involving 51 patients with chronic LCL rupture who had percutaneous LCL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft was conducted between January 2021 and December 2022 in National Orthopaedic Hospital, Dala-Kano, Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were patients between the ages of 18 and 45 years with chronic isolated LCL and not more than 1 injury of knee ligament. Exclusion criteria were active infection, and multi-ligament knee injury requiring 2-staged surgery. The knee functions were assessed preoperatively, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively using the Lysholm scoring system. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of the treatment was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Relevant information was recorded into Microsoft Excel sheet and data was analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 for windows. The paired samples t-test was used to compare the clinical outcomes as continuous variables. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. Results: The mean age of the patients was (30.10 ± 5.90) years. The median time from injury to surgery was 7 months (ranging from 3 to 28 months). The mean follow-up period was (14.07 ± 3.13) months. The mean preoperative and 1-year postoperative Lysholm scores were 44.33 ± 12.97 and 97.96 ± 1.23, respectively. Conclusion: Percutaneous LCL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft significantly improves patient knee function and results in excellent patient satisfaction. © 2023 Chinese Medical Association","","adult; African; Article; autograft; clinical outcome; controlled study; female; follow up; human; intervention study; knee function; knee instability; knee ligament injury; knee ligament surgery; lateral collateral ligament; Likert scale; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; patient satisfaction; prospective study; adolescent; ankle lateral ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; joint ligament; knee; middle aged; Nigeria; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Humans; Knee Joint; Lateral Ligament, Ankle; Ligaments, Articular; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","LaPrade, R.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to compare the results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with AHPLT and hamstring graft at the minimum of 3 years follow-up. Knee stability, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and Tegner activity level were collected. Results: There was no clinical significance regarding physical examination. Postoperative IKDC score was higher in the hamstring group compared with AHPLT group. Multiple regression analysis was done. The parsimonious model revealed graft types and gender were the most optimal variables explained postoperative IKDC score. Conclusion: AHPLT graft can be an alternative choice to conventional graft for single anatomic ACL reconstruction with less donor site morbidity, however there must be concern for smaller graft in short and thin female patients. © The Author(s) 2022.","AHPLT; anterior cruciate ligament; functional score; IKDC; peroneus longus tendon","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon graft; Article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; female; follow up; gender; hamstring tendon; hamstring tendon graft; human; Knee stability International Knee Documentation Committee; major clinical study; male; morbidity; multiple regression; musculoskeletal disease assessment; postoperative complication; postoperative period; retrospective study; Tegner activity score; tendon graft","","","","","","","Bi, Mingguang, All-Inside Single-Bundle Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with the Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Compared to the Semitendinosus Tendon: A Two-Year Follow-Up Study, Journal of Knee Surgery, 31, 10, pp. 1022-1030, (2018); Angthong, Chayanin, The anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the peroneus longus tendon: A biomechanical and clinical evaluation of the donor ankle morbidity, Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand, 98, 6, pp. 555-560, (2015); Zhao, Jinzhong, The biomechanical and clinical application of using the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft source, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, 3, pp. 662-671, (2012); Rhatomy, Sholahuddin, Peroneus longus autograft can be recommended as a superior graft to hamstring tendon in single-bundle ACL reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 27, 11, pp. 3552-3559, (2019); Karlsson, Jón, Anatomic single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, part 2: Clinical application of surgical technique, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 39, 9, pp. 2016-2026, (2011); Park, Chul-hyun, Donor Site Morbidity after Lateral Ankle Ligament Reconstruction Using the Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 45, 4, pp. 922-928, (2017); Anat Res Int, (2012); Rodriguez-Martinez, Andrea, Height and body-mass index trajectories of school-aged children and adolescents from 1985 to 2019 in 200 countries and territories: a pooled analysis of 2181 population-based studies with 65 million participants, The Lancet, 396, 10261, pp. 1511-1524, (2020); Lertwanich, Pisit, Validity and reliability of Thai version of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form, Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand, 91, 8, pp. 1218-1225, (2008); Park, Sejin, Outcome of Arthroscopic Single-Bundle Versus Double-Bundle Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament: A Preliminary 2-Year Prospective Study, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 26, 5, pp. 630-636, (2010)","U.

The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. Purpose: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-N·m force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P =.863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 ± 0.83–cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL–posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 ± 1.02–cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 ± 1.35–cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P =.154). Conclusion: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height. Clinical Relevance: The side-to-side difference in heel height may be a clinically relevant examination tool for diagnosing multiligament knee injuries. © The Author(s) 2022.","ACL injury; FCL injury; heel height; knee hyperextension; medial collateral ligament","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; arthrotomy; Article; biomechanics; body mass; cadaver; clinical assessment; controlled study; female; femur; genu recurvatum; heel; human; knee function; knee injury; knee instability; knee medial collateral ligament; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; orthopedic surgery; randomized controlled trial; range of motion","","","","","","","Alm, Lena, Preoperative medial knee instability is an underestimated risk factor for failure of revision ACL reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 28, 8, pp. 2458-2467, (2020); Bizot, Pascal, Experimental capsulo-ligamentar lesions of the knee during passive hyperextension.

Methods: A clinical data of 30 patients with PCL injury, who were admitted between December 2015 and September 2018 and met the selection criteria, was retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon and TightRope technique. Among them, 19 were male and 11 were female, aged 17-48 years (mean, 28.2 years). The PCL injury was caused by traffic accident in 8 cases, sport in 14 cases, falling and bruising by a heavy objective in 5 cases, and other injuries in 3 cases. The interval between injury and operation was 10-90 days (mean, 39.3 days). The PCL injury was rated as grade Ⅱ in 6 cases and grade Ⅲ in 24 cases. The posterior drawer test was positive in 26 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 24 cases. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 61.37±8.49, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was near normal in 2 cases, abnormal in 8 cases, and significantly abnormal in 20 cases. The modified Lysholm knee score was 62.20±5.67. The knee range of motion (ROM) was (101.83±8.15) °. Results: The operative time ranged from 70 to 110 minutes (mean, 79.7 minutes). All incisions healed by first intetion. All patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 19.0 months). There were 3 cases of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity after operation, and 1 case of approximately 10° limitation of knee extension. At last follow-up, the posterior drawer test was positive in 2 cases and the inverse Lachman test was positive in 1 case, with significant differences compared with the preoperative period ( χ2=38.571, P=0.000; χ2=36.274, P=0.000). The IKDC score was 84.67±3.67, and the objective IKDC ligament grading was normal in 16 cases, nearly normal in 10 cases, abnormal in 3 cases, and significantly abnormal in 1 case; the modified Lysholm knee score was 90.37±4.49; all of the above indexes were significantly better than preoperative ones, and the differences were significant ( t=-12.387, P=0.000; Z=-2.810, P=0.005; t=-22.865, P=0.000). Knee ROM was (88.33±9.86)° at 1 month after operation and reached (113.33±13.48)° at last follow-up, showing significant differences between pre- and post-operation ( P<0.05). MRI re-examination showed that the form and position of reconstructed PCL were satisfactory. Conclusion: It can obtain good short-term effectiveness for PCL injuries by arthroscopic single bundle four-strand reconstruction using autologous semitendinosus tendon and anterior half of peroneus longus tendon, which has the advantages of reliable surgical approach, safe operation, and precise effectiveness.","Arthroscopy; peroneus longus tendon; posterior cruciate ligament; semitendinosus tendon; single-bundle reconstruction; TightRope technique","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthroscopy; female; hamstring tendon; human; knee; male; middle aged; posterior cruciate ligament; retrospective study; tendon; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Arthroscopy; Female; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Retrospective Studies; Tendons; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","10021892","","","33998207","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106180270"

At last follow-up, the Lysholm score of the knee joint was 84.85±7.03, and the IKDC score was 87.13±6.27, which were significant different from preoperative ones ( t=-13.45, P=0.00; t= -39.12, P=0.00); the AOFAS score of ankle joint was 93.98±2.14, which was not significant different from preoperative one ( t=8.09, P=0.90). The tibia posterior displacement under posterior stress position was (2.75±1.76) mm and the difference of dial-test at 30° knee flexion between affected and healthy sides was (1.75±2.09)°, which were significant different from preoperative ones ( t=29.00, P=0.00; t=4.96, P=0.00). The posterior drawer test and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 1 case and negative in 39 cases; the anterior drawer test and the varus and valgus stress tests were all negative. Conclusion: Reconstruction of PCL with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy can significantly improve the stability and function of the knee joint, with satisfactory clinical results.","arthroscopy; ligament reconstruction; Peroneus longus tendon; posterior cruciate ligament","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthroscopy; female; human; knee; male; middle aged; posterior cruciate ligament; surgery; tendon; young adult; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Tendons; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","10021892","","","33624468","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101915108"

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 35 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction with autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy between October 2017 and October 2018. There were 19 males and 16 females with an average age of 43.4 years (range, 18-60 years), with 20 cases of left knee and 15 cases of right knee. The causes of injury included traffic accident in 14 cases, falling injury in 13 cases, and sports injury in 8 cases. The time from injury to operation ranged from 3 to 9 days (mean, 4.7 days). The patients suffered from swelling, pain, and limited mobility of knee joint before operation. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were positive before operation, whereas MRI was taken to confirm the ACL rupture. After operation, the patients were followed up every 3 months until the knee joint's function returned to normal. MRI and X-ray films were used to observe the tendon-bone healing as well as the position of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test were conducted to observe the improvement of knee joint mobility. The functional improvements were evaluated by the International Knee Documents Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, knee injury and osteoarthritis (KOOS) score. Results: All the 35 patients were followed up 12-18 months, with an average of 14.2 months. The incisions healed by first intention, and no complications such as infection, joint stiffness, and rerupture occurred. Postoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test turned to be negative of all patients. MRI showed that the ACL was continuous, and the tendon-bone in the distal femur tunnel and proximal tibia tunnel recovered well after operation. X-ray films showed that the positions of Endobutton suspension plate and hollow nail were stable. The IKDC, Lysholm, and KOOS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation were significantly improved when compared with those before operation, and the scores were further improved with time after operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: For patients with ACL rupture, ACL reconstruction with the autologous ipsilateral PLT under arthroscopy has satisfactory effectiveness of quick recovery, good function, and great stability.","anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; ligament reconstruction; Peroneus longus tendon","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; female; human; knee; male; middle aged; retrospective study; tendon; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Tendons; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","10021892","","","32666726","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088051861"

Thus, peroneus longus is a potential graft in reconstructive orthopaedic procedures. However, there was few study in evaluation of peroneus longus usage in ACL reconstruction. This study aimed to quantify the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. Methods: Patients who suffered isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent isolated single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft. Functional score (IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score) were assessed at pre-operative and 2-years after surgery. Graft diameter was measured intraoperative. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurement and ankle scoring using AOFAS and FADI. We also measured serial hop test. Results: Seventy-five patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Peroneus longus graft diameter was 8.38 ± 0.68 mm. There was significant difference between pre and 2-years post-operative functional score in IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score. Mean of AOFAS was 98.93 ± 3.10 and FADI was 99.79 ± 0.59 with no significant decrease of thigh circumference, and good serial hop test result. Conclusion: ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft has excellent functional score in IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, Tegner-Lysholm score at 2-years follow up with the advantages of greater graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy, good serial hop test result, and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI score.

Methods: From January 2015 to September 2016, a total of 24 patients with proximal injury of ACL, confirmed by arthroscopy, were admitted to the sports medicine department of our hospital. The ACL was completely ruptured from the proximal footprint and the tibial side residual remained intact. There were 19 males and 5 females; 16 cases on the right side and 8 cases on the left side. The mean age was 27.88±7.13 years old; The interval between injury and surgery was 14.83±9.09 d; The dissociate peroneus longus tendon and semitendinosus tendonfrom the injured extremity were folded in half, then braided and trimmed into ACL graft for use. The ACL remnant was preserved and the graft was pulled through the stump for single bundle anatomic intrathecal reconstruction. The ACL graft was fixed with Endobutton on the femoral side and interference screw on the tibial side. The results of Lachman test, Lysholm scores, Tegner scores and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores of knee before operation and at final visit were recorded to evaluate the stability and function of the knee. Visual analogue score (VAS) was used to record the changes of pain at the site where the peroneal longus tendon was harvested. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scores were recorded before injury and at the final visit to assess the effect of ankle function after peroneal longus tendon resection. Results: The diameter of the ACL graft made of dissociate peroneus longus tendon and semitendinosus tendon is 8.88±0.30 mm. All patients were followed up at the outpatient clinic, with an average of 34.38±5.40 months, and no serious complications such as rerupture and joint infection were found. There were 16 grade B, 6 grade C and 2 grade D for preoperative Lachman test, none with hard end point. At last vist, there were 23 cases of grade A and 1 grade B, all with hard end points for Lachman test. At the preoperative and final visit, the Lysholm scores of the knee joint were 35.20±11.92 and 94.29±2.92 (t=23.850, P=0.000). Tegner scores were 3.46±0.93 and 8.04±1.00 (t=16.653, P=0.000). The subjective IKDC scores of knee joint were 47.63±13.06 and 91.71±3.75 (t=15.972, P=0.000). At the final visit, all the indicators of the knee were improved compared with those before surgery, and the difference was statistically significant.The AOFAS scores before injury and at the final visit were 98.83 (2.78) and 98.17 (4.01), respectively, with no statistically significant difference (t=1.850, P=0.076). The VAS scores for the harvest of theperoneus longus tendon were 4.50±1.41, 0.54±0.65 and 0.29±0.55 immediately and 6 months after the operation and at the last visit.There was statistically significant difference between the scores immediately and 6 months after the operation (t=14.900, P=0.001).There was statistically significant differences between the scores at 6 months after the operation and the final visit (t=2.770, P=0.011).

At present, ligament autografts have been the best method due to good histocompatibility, rapid healing, no cross-contamination, and low cost of treatment. However, autografts do not have infinite amount and are also not always feasible. Anterior half of peroneus longus tenden autograft is likely to become a source of autograft with many advantages. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT). AIM: To evaluate the initial outcome of ACL reconstruction arthroscopy by anterior half of peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This is a prospective non-controlled case series. RESULTS: A prospective study on 30 patients (from 9 / 2016 to 01 / 2019) had both ACL and MCL injury who had operated ACL reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT) at Department of General Orthopaedic and Trauma, Viet Duc hospital. Our outcome: the year average 35.4 ys, the rate of ACL rupture combined with meniscus injury was 40%. The average diameter AHPLT autograft is 7.0 mm. The function Lysholm scores improved from 59 to 94.27 postoperative 6 months. No difference beetwen the AOFAS scale of preoperative and postoperative.

Methods: Between June 2015 and February 2018, 28 patients with ACL rupture and MCL grade Ⅲ injury were treated. Arthroscopic GraftLink technique was used to reconstruct ACL with autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT), and suture anchor fixation was used to repair MCL. There were 22 males and 6 females, aged 21-47 years, with an average age of 30.4 years. The cause of injury included traffic accident in 18 cases, falling from height in 7 cases, and sports injury in 3 cases. The time from injury to admission was 1-2 weeks, with an average of 1.3 weeks. The preoperative Lysholm score of knee joint was 46.8±3.0 and the International Knee Documentation Commission (IKDC) score was 49.2±2.7. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of ankle joint was 98.29±0.72. Both Lachman test and valgus stress test were positive. There were 8 cases of meniscus injury and 2 cases of cartilage injury. Results: The operation time ranged from 55 to 90 minutes, with an average of 72.5 minutes. All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no complications related to operation occurred. All patients were followed up 6-38 months, with an average of 20.7 months. At 3 months after operation, the range of motion of the knee joint was 116- 132°, with an average of 122°. Lachman test showed that the anterior translation more than 5 mm in 2 cases, and the others were negative; while the valgus stress test showed that all patients were positive. At 6 months after operation, the Lysholm score and IKDC score of knee joint were 90.2±1.8 and 93.5±2.3, respectively, which were significantly higher than preoperative scores ( t=31.60, P=0.00; t=29.91, P=0.01); AOFAS score of ankle joint was 97.86±0.68, with no significant difference compared with preoperative score ( t=2.89, P=0.08). KT-1000 test showed that the difference of anterior relaxation between bilateral knee joints was less than 2 mm in 25 cases and 3 to 5 mm in 3 cases. Conclusion: The method of ACL reconstruction via arthroscopic GraftLink technique with PLT and MCL repair via suture anchor fixation has the advantages of less knee injury and faster recovery, and there is no significant impact on ankle function after tendon removal.","anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; autologous tendon; GraftLink technique; medial collateral ligament; suture anchor","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthroscopy; collateral ligament; female; human; knee; male; middle aged; procedures; suture anchor; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Arthroscopy; Collateral Ligaments; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Suture Anchors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","10021892","","","31197994","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068130959"

We investigated the efficacy and safety of this alternative autograft compared with autologous hamstring tendon (HT). Biomechanical testing of the graft options was performed and compared with the native ACL. Thirty-eight patients with acute ACL ruptures and grade III MCL injuries were treated with ACL reconstruction with a doubled autologous PLT or quadrupled autologous HT. Knee stability and function was evaluated clinically with the Lachman test and KT-2000 arthometer as well as subjectively with functional scores. Effects on the donor ankle were evaluated by biomechanical testing. The ultimate tensile strengths of doubled PLT and quadrupled HT were significantly higher than that of the native ACL and the ultimate tensile strength of doubled PLT was comparable with that of quadrupled HT. There were no significant differences in clinical or functional scores between the two groups. There were no significant differences in pre- and postoperative biomechanical testing of the donor ankle. PLT is a suitable alternative autograft for an ACL reconstruction in patients with a concomitant grade III MCL injury without a significant biomechanical disadvantage to the ankle donor site. © © 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.","ACL reconstruction; autograft; peroneus longus","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; autotransplantation; biomechanics; clinical article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; female; hamstring tendon; human; knee function; knee instability; knee ligament injury; male; medial collateral ligament injury; patient safety; peroneus longus tendon; tendon; tendon graft; tensile strength; ankle; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; autograft; knee; middle aged; physiology; procedures; transplantation; Adult; Aged; Ankle Joint; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Autografts; Female; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

Design: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1ρ and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1ρ or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1ρ or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. Results: Higher baseline SSD T1ρ posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1ρ pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year. Conclusion: T1ρ and T2 of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS after injury and both KOOS and Marx after reconstruction. Such associations may help clinicians stratify outcomes post-injury, and thus, improve patient management. © 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.","ACL reconstruction; Cartilage; KOOS; Marx activity rating scale; T1ρ; T2","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; controlled study; daily life activity; disease association; disease severity; female; follow up; human; knee injury; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; knee meniscus; major clinical study; male; Marx activity rating scale; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; postoperative period; priority journal; questionnaire; rating scale; relaxation time; symptom; patient-reported outcome; Activities of Daily Living; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Humans; Knee Injuries; Patient Reported Outcome Measures","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (A123553, P50AR060752, UL1 RR024131); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS","Funding text 1: This study was funded by NIH/NIAMS P50 AR060752 , AOSSM Cartilage Initiative Grant, and OREF Resident Research Grant A123553 .

Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20° axial/20° coronal angulations and 10° axial/30° coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. Results: Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10° axial/30° coronal angulation (P < 0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20° axial/20° coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20° axial/20° coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. © 2014, European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).","Articular; Knee injuries; Ligaments; Surgery","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; cadaver; computer assisted tomography; female; femur; human; injuries; knee; male; middle aged; procedures; surgery; Adult; Aged; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Cadaver; Female; Femur; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","","","","","","","Abebe, Ermias Shawel, Femoral tunnel placement during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: An in vivo imaging analysis comparing transtibial and 2-incision tibial tunnel-independent techniques, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 37, 10, pp. 1904-1911, (2009); Βasdekis, George Konstantinos, Influence of Knee Flexion Angle on Femoral Tunnel Characteristics When Drilled Through the Anteromedial Portal During Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 24, 4, pp. 459-464, (2008); Camarda, Lawrence K.C., Avoiding tunnel collisions between fibular collateral ligament and ACL posterolateral bundle reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 19, 4, pp. 598-603, (2011); Coobs, Benjamin R., Intra-articular lateral femoral condyle fracture following an ACL revision reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 18, 9, pp. 1290-1293, (2010); Duffee, Andrew R., Bioabsorbable screw divergence angle, not tunnel preparation method influences soft tissue tendon graft-bone tunnel fixation in healthy bone, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 15, 1, pp. 17-25, (2007); Ferretti, Mário, Osseous Landmarks of the Femoral Attachment of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament: An Anatomic Study, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 23, 11, pp. 1218-1225, (2007); Gelber, Pablo Eduardo, Femoral tunnel drilling angles for the posterolateral corner in multiligamentary knee reconstructions: Computed tomography evaluation in a cadaveric model, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 29, 2, pp. 257-265, (2013); Harner, Christopher Dechant, Biomechanical analysis of a posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Deficiency of the posterolateral structures as a cause of graft failure, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 1, pp. 32-39, (2000); Kim, Sungjae, Intertunnel relationships in combined anterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner reconstruction: An in vivo 3-dimensional anatomic study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, 4, pp. 849-857, (2013); Kim, Sungjae, The influence of posterolateral rotatory instability on ACL reconstruction: Comparison between isolated ACL reconstruction and ACL reconstruction combined with posterolateral corner reconstruction, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 94, 3, pp. 253-259, (2012)","J.C.

Methods: From January 2006 to December 2009, 35 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries were recruited to undergo surgical procedures. There were 30 males and 5 females with an average age of 31.8 years (range: 21 - 56). All anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions underwent arthrosocopy. All ligaments were reconstructed with peroneus longus tendon and fixed with absorb screw. The post-operative assessments included the followings; clinical evaluations, Lysholm knee score, KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale (AOFAS). Results: All cases were followed up for an average follow-up period of 15 months (range: 12 -24). The healing time was 6-15 weeks, according to the Lysholm knee score, their outcomes were excellent (n =25), good (n =6), fair (n = 3) and poor (n = 1). The average score was 97.2 (range: 60 - 100). The rate of excellent and good was 88.6%; according to the KT-3000 arthrometer evaluations, the outcomes were normal (n =28), nearly normal (n = 4), abnormal (n = 2) and poor (n = 1). Preoperatively, the average anterior displacement was 11.59 ± 1.25 mm and the average anterior displacement at final follow-up 1.76 ± 1.83 mm. The average AOFAS score was 96.3 (range: 84 - 100). Lysholm knee score and KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation had statistical differences (P < 0.05) while AOFAS score showed no difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon can be a good substitute of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. And its resection has no major influence for ankle joint.

Methods: The study included 29 patients (27 males, 2 females; mean age 30 years; range 21 to 39 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft and interference nail fixation. Fourteen patients (48.3%) also had partial meniscectomy during surgery. The results were assessed according to the Lysholm scores and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale at the end of at least five years of follow-up. Results: According to the IKDC scale, 17 patients (58.6%) were rated as normal or nearly normal, and 12 patients (41.4%) were rated as abnormal or severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm score was 83.7 (range 45 to 100), with excellent or good results in 23 patients (79.3%). Radiographic examination showed mild (n=10) or moderate (n=1) degenerative changes in the knee joint. Compared with the normal side, no flexion or extension losses occurred in the affected knees. Stability of the ACL was assessed by the Lachman test, which showed normal findings in 12 patients (41.4%), while nine patients had 1+, five patients had 2+, and three patients had 3+ anteroposterior laxity. Pivot-shift test was negative in 13 patients (44.8%); ten patients had 1+ pivot glide, and six patients had 2+ pivot shift. Two patients (6.9%) complained of mild to moderate pressure pain, paresthesia and dysesthesia at the donor site of PLT. No patient experienced ankle joint dysfunction or difficulty in sports activities due to PLT graft transfer. Conclusion: Our data show that PLT can be an appropriate autograft source for ACL reconstruction, avoiding potential complications of autografts obtained from the knee region. ©2008 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.","Anterior cruciate ligament/injuries/surgery; Knee joint; Range of motion, articular; Tendon transfer","achilles tendon; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; evaluation; female; human; injury; injury scale; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; methodology; orthopedic surgery; pathology; radiography; reoperation; transplantation; treatment outcome; Turkey (republic); Achilles Tendon; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Knee Injuries; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Range of Motion, Articular; Reoperation; Treatment Outcome; Turkey","","","","","","","Gorschewsky, Ottmar, Clinical comparison of the tutoplast allograft and autologous patellar tendon (bone-patellar tendon-bone) for the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: 2- and 6-year results, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 8, pp. 1202-1209, (2005); Feller, Julian A., Early post-operative morbidity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Patellar tendon versus hamstring graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 9, 5, pp. 260-266, (2001); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Donor-site morbidity and anterior knee problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autografts, Arthroscopy, 17, 9, pp. 971-980, (2001); Peterson, Robert K., Allograft versus autograft patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A 5-year follow-up, Arthroscopy, 17, 1, pp. 9-13, (2001); Shelton, Walter R., Autograft versus allograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 13, 4, pp. 446-449, (1997); Spicer, Dominic D.M., Anterior knee symptoms after four-strand hamstring tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 8, 5, pp. 286-289, (2000); Tashiro, Toshiyuki, Influence of medial hamstring tendon harvest on knee flexor strength after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A detailed evaluation with comparison of single- and double-tendon harvest, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 31, 4, pp. 522-529, (2003); Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopically assisted semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft in reconstruction for acute anterior cruciate ligament injuries in athletes, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 6, pp. 726-731, (1996); Sherman, Orrin H., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Which graft is best?, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 20, 9, pp. 974-980, (2004); Burks, Robert T., The effects of semitendinosus and gracilis harvest in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 21, 10, pp. 1177-1185, (2005)","S.

This retrospective clinical study analyses risk factors and outcome after arthrolysis in a large population. Material and methods: Two hundred twenty-three patients who had undergone arthrolysis after ACL reconstruction were examined. Range of motion (ROM) was reduced due to arthrofibrosis of the joint in 70% (n=156). Other reasons, such as cyclops syndrome or osteoarthritis were found in 30% (n=67). The mean time interval between arthrolysis and follow-up was 4.29 years. We recorded timing of surgery, additional injuries, state of the knee before reconstruction, range of motion, pain during rehabilitation, beginning, duration and type of rehabilitation, severity and etiology of joint stiffness and the time between ACL reconstruction and revision. The present state of the knee was documented using the IKDC form. Results: A significant correla tion of arthrofibrosis and preoperative irritation (plt;0.001), preoperative limited ROM (p=0.001), perioperative pain (p=0.046) and early beginning of muscle training (p=0.064) was found. Combination of a remaining loss of extension and development of degenerative joint disease was also significant (p=0.001). The decrease of sports activity compared with the level before ACL injury was highly significant (plt;0,001). The criteria to minimize the risk of arthrofibrosis and the optimal timing of arthrolysis are pointed out. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","ACL reconstruction; Arthrofibrosis; IKDC; Stiff knee","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthralgia; arthrofibrosis; arthropathy; article; comorbidity; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease duration; disease severity; female; follow up; human; joint function; joint mobility; joint stiffness; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; medical record; muscle training; operation duration; osteoarthritis; pain assessment; perioperative period; physical activity; physiotherapy; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; reoperation; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; sport; time; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthritis; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors","","","","","","","Almekinders, Louis C., Post-operative problems following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 2, pp. 78-82, (1995); Anderson, Allen F., Instrumented evaluation of knee laxity: A comparison of five arthrometers, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 135-140, (1992); Arthroskopie, (1999); Bosch, Ulrich, Arthrofibrosis is the result of a T cell mediated immune response, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 9, 5, pp. 282-289, (2001); Dandy, David J., Problems in regaining full extension of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does arthrofibrosis exist?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 2, 2, pp. 76-79, (1994); Delincé, Philippe E., Different aspects of the cyclops lesion following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A multifactorial etiopathogenesis, Arthroscopy, 14, 8, pp. 869-876, (1998); Ferretti, Andrea, Osteoarthritis of the knee after ACL reconstruction, International Orthopaedics, 15, 4, pp. 367-371, (1991); Fink, Christian, Development of osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament injury.
