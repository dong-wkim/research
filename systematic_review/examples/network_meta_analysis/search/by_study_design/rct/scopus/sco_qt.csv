Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) develops secondary to joint injury, such as ligament rupture, and there is increasing evidence suggesting a key role for inflammation in the aetiology of PTOA and associated functional deficits. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal degeneration following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. We sought to assess the efficacy of CSF1-R inhibition to mitigate muscle and joint pathology in a mouse model of PTOA. Four-month-old mice were randomized to receive a CSF1-R inhibitor and studied for 7 or 28 days after joint injury. Additionally, we profiled synovial fluid samples for CSF1-R from patients with injury to their ACL. Transcriptomic analysis of quadriceps muscle and articular cartilage in CSF1-R inhibitor-treated animals at 7 days after injury revealed elevated chondrocyte differentiation within articular cartilage and enhanced metabolic and contractile gene expression within skeletal muscle. At 28 days post-injury, CSF1-R inhibition attenuated PTOA severity and mitigated skeletal muscle atrophy. Patient synovial fluid CSF1-R levels correlated with matrix metalloproteinase 13, a prognostic marker and molecular effector of PTOA. Our findings support an opportunity for CSF1-R targeting to mitigate the severity of PTOA and muscle atrophy after joint injury. (Figure presented.). Key points: Posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) of the knee commonly results from direct injury to the joint, which is characterized by pain, weakness, and disability. Induction of colony stimulating factor one receptor (CSF1-R) is positively associated with knee trauma severity, and the initial acute inflammatory state suppresses muscle recovery and degrades articular cartilage. Skeletal muscle and articular cartilage transcriptomic response following direct joint injury in a murine model of PTOA is rescued by pharmacological inhibition of CSF1-R. CSF1-R inhibition mitigated skeletal muscle atrophy and attenuated PTOA severity and synovitis. Patient synovial fluid CSF1-R levels correlated with matrix metalloproteinase 13, a prognostic marker and molecular effector of PTOA, offering further evidence for CSF1-R as a therapeutic target across musculoskeletal tissues after injury. © 2024 The Authors.

Sharma PGIMS, Rohtak, Rohtak, HR, India","Background: Anterior Cruciate ligament rupture is a common orthopaedic injury that requires singlebundle/double-bundle reconstruction to restore the normal kinematics of the knee joint. However, anterolateral laxity remains a frequently encountered problem in chronic injuries, even with successful ACL reconstruction. This has been attributed to the anterior asymmetrical translation of the lateral tibial plateau. Thus, additional augmentation of the anterolateral structures is necessary to correct the rotator instability along with ACL reconstruction. Methods: This prospective interventional study includes high-risk athletes, patients with 3+ pivot shift in ACL deficient knees, patients with hyperlaxity, and patients requiring revision ACL reconstruction due to clinical instability. A combined procedure of single-bundle ACL reconstruction and Lateral Extra-articular tenodesis using Lemaire's technique was employed. Post-op rehabilitation was started from day one with quadriceps strengthening exercises and gradual progressive knee bending on the couch. Closed chain exercises were started after two weeks and full weight bearing, cycling, light jogging, and squatting were initiated after six weeks. Return to the sport was allowed at six to nine months. Results: It was observed that this technique resulted in significant improvements in the Lysholm score (p<0.0001), mean subjective IKDC (p<0.0001), and Tegner Activity score progressively increased post-operatively. Further, in subsequent follow-ups, the majority of patients (94.4%) were pivot shift negative, and functional outcomes were excellent to good. Conclusion: The study concluded that this combined procedure significantly increased the functional outcome scores and substantiated the possibility of a return to sport by providing additional rotational stability. © 2024 The Authors","Anterior cruciate ligament; Athletes; Augmentation; Lateral extra-articular tenodesis; Sports injury","","","","","","","","Snook, George A., A short history of the anterior cruciate ligament and the treatment of tears, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 172, pp. 11-13, (1983); Senter, Carlin, Biomechanical analysis of tibial torque and knee flexion angle: Implications for understanding knee injury, Sports Medicine, 36, 8, pp. 635-641, (2006); Open Orthop J, (2012); J Chir, (1967); Christel, Pascal S., Lateral extra-articular tenodesis of the knee using a short strip of iliotibial band, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 88, 5, pp. 508-513, (2002); Rossi, Michael J., Development and validation of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form., American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 1, (2002); Tegner, Yelverton, Rating systems in the evaluation of knee ligament injuries, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 198, pp. 43-49, (1985); Asagumo, Hiroto, Anatomic Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Using Double-Bundle Hamstring Tendons: Surgical Techniques, Clinical Outcomes, and Complications, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 23, 6, pp. 602-609, (2007); Song, Eun-kyoo, Prospective comparative study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the double-bundle and single-bundle techniques, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 37, 9, pp. 1705-1711, (2009); Araki, Daisuke, A prospective randomised study of anatomical single-bundle versus double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Quantitative evaluation using an electromagnetic measurement system, International Orthopaedics, 35, 3, pp. 439-446, (2011)","V.

Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are prevalent among athletes and pose a considerable threat to their careers. While ACLR remains the primary therapeutic intervention for such injuries, the assessment of postoperative rehabilitation still encounters significant challenges. Traditional assessment methods are limited by subjectivity and the absence of quantitative data. Mechanical quantitative techniques present a novel approach, offering objective and precise quantitative metrics for knee functional rehabilitation through the analysis of soft tissue mechanical properties. Methods: An observational methodology will be employed to gather clinical data from patients with ACL injuries. A soft tissue mechanical quantitative measurement device will be utilized for knee functional assessment. The anticipated sample size is 66 cases, with inclusion criteria encompassing specific age ranges, injury durations, and other pertinent factors. Exclusion criteria will exclude participants with other injuries or diseases that may impact rehabilitation. The assessment protocol will consist of traditional knee functional assessments, including knee muscle strength, range of motion, and Lysholm scores, as well as mechanical quantitative assessments of the quadriceps and hamstrings. Blinding: Due to the inherent challenges in clinical controlled trials, a strict double-blind design is infeasible. Therefore, participants will be aware of their group assignments, whereas assessors will remain blinded to the specific research objectives and group allocations. Data entry and statistical grouping will be managed by independent personnel. Statistical Analysis: Data analysis is conducted using SPSS 20.0 software. Categorical data are represented as frequencies (percentages), with intergroup comparisons made using chi-square tests or exact probability methods; continuous data are represented as means ± standard deviations, with intergroup comparisons made using t-tests, analysis of variance, or rank sum tests, and correlation analysis is performed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. A P-value <0.05 is considered statistically significant. Expected Results: Firstly, It is anticipated that there will be a significant correlation between the assessment results of mechanical quantitative techniques and traditional functional assessment methods. This will validate the reliability of mechanical quantitative techniques and facilitate their complementary use alongside traditional assessment methods. Secondly. It is expected that this study will develop new scientific measurement tools and methods, mitigating errors associated with subjective judgments and ensuring the objectivity and accuracy of assessment results. By providing specific, quantifiable data, this study will offer physicians a more intuitive and precise basis for assessment. © 2025 Zhu et al.

The addition of LET or anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction is typically recommended at the time of index ACL reconstruction surgery and is performed after the ACL graft is tensioned. Rotational instability has been described in cases where the ACL graft was malpositioned too vertically, and in those cases, ACL revision is indicated. In our case, ACL reconstruction was performed in isolation in a hyperflexible, high-risk (volleyball) female athlete, and she had persistent complaints of rotational instability despite an intact and well-positioned ACL graft on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. She demonstrated excessive internal rotation of the tibia in relation to the femur and exhibited symptomatic anterolateral instability on clinical examination, with a negative pivot shift but pain on internal rotation stress. She underwent a second surgery consisting of isolated modified Lemaire LET after examination under anesthesia (EUA) demonstrated negative Lachman and pivot shift. Second-look arthroscopy demonstrated an intact quadriceps autograft ACL graft. She recovered uneventfully, and her rotational instability problem was resolved. She returned to sports 12 months after the surgery and has been pleased with her result. Key Concepts: (1) Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) can be added to increased rotational stability in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. (2) Although typically added during the index procedure, it can be successfully completed later if needed. (3) The ACL confers both anteroposterior and rotational stability to prevent excessive anterior translation and excessive internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur. (4) LET can augment the ACL graft in preventing rotational instability in the setting of an ACL-deficient knee. © 2025 The Author(s)","ACL reconstruction; Anterolateral ligament; Lateral extra-articular tenodesis; Rotational instability","","","","","","","","Jesani, Satyen, Modified lemaire lateral extra-articular tenodesis augmentation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, JBJS Essential Surgical Techniques, 9, 4, (2019)","","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","","","","","English","J. pediatr. orthop. soc.

However, there is concern about postoperative loss of knee extensor muscle strength because of harvesting a portion of the quadriceps tendon. Hypothesis: Knee extensor muscle strength after superficial slip of the quadriceps tendon MPFLR (SQ-MPFLR) decreases postoperatively, and there are specific factors that effect knee extensor muscle strength recovery. Study Design: Case series study; Level of evidence 4. Methods: A total of 26 patients who underwent unilateral primary SQ-MPFLR were enrolled. Clinical and functional outcomes were evaluated using the Kujala score and Tegner activity score preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively. Knee extensor muscle strength was examined preoperatively and 6 and 12 months postoperatively using the Biodex dynamometer. The knee muscle strength of the operated leg was compared with that of the contralateral leg using the limb symmetry index (LSI). The associations of sex, body mass index, and daily sports activity level with knee extensor muscle strengths at 6 and 12 months postoperatively were investigated and compared between the 2 groups. Results: The preoperative mean Kujala score was 65.0 and significantly improved to 94.7 at 12 months after surgery (P <.001). The preoperative Tegner activity score was 5.6, and the 12-month postoperative score was 5.8. The knee extensor LSI increased from 69.2% preoperatively to 82.0% at 12 months postoperatively. The patient group with a high sports activity level had a significant higher knee extensor muscle LSI (mean, 87.8%) than the group with a low sports activity level at 12 months postoperatively (P =.003). Conclusion: The knee extensor LSI of patients who underwent SQ-MPFLR increased from 69.2% preoperatively to 82.0% postoperatively at 12 months. The patient group with a high sports activity level had a significantly higher knee extensor LSI than the group with a low sports activity level at 12 months after SQ-MPFLR surgery. © The Author(s) 2025.","knee extensor muscle strength; medial patellofemoral ligament; patellar dislocation; quadriceps tendon","adolescent; adult; aged; anatomical concepts; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior knee pain scale; arthroscopy; Article; body mass; clinical article; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; extensor muscle; female; fluoroscopy; human; knee dislocation; knee extensor muscle; knee extensor strength; knee ligament surgery; male; medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction; muscle strength; patella dislocation; patella fracture; postoperative care; prospective study; quadriceps tendon; skin incision; sports medicine; superficial slip; Tegner activity score; very elderly","","","Biodex dynamometer; Ethibond No. 2, Ethicon; Ethibond No. 2, Johnson and Johnson; MILAGRO Advance Interference Screw, De Puy; R software Version 4.1.2, R Foundation","Ethicon; Johnson and Johnson; De Puy; R Foundation","","","Open Orthop J, (2015); Colvin, Alexis Chiang, Patellar instability, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 90, 12, pp. 2751-2762, (2008); Fink, Christian, Minimally invasive reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament using quadriceps tendon, Arthroscopy Techniques, 3, 3, pp. e325-e329, (2014); Goyal, Deepak Rajkumar, Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction: The superficial quad technique, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, 5, pp. 1022-1029, (2013); Małecki, Krzysztof, Bilateral Hidden Isokinetic Quadriceps Performance before and after MPFL Reconstruction in Pediatric Patients, Journal of Knee Surgery, 34, 8, pp. 906-912, (2021); Matsushita, Takehiko, Changes in knee extensor strengths before and after medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction, Physician and Sportsmedicine, 47, 2, pp. 220-226, (2019); Meynard, Pierre, Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction for recurrent patellar dislocation allows a good rate to return to sport, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 30, 6, pp. 1865-1870, (2022); Nelitz, Manfred, Anatomic reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament in children and adolescents using a pedicled quadriceps tendon graft shows favourable results at a minimum of 2-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 26, 4, pp. 1210-1215, (2018); Raghuveer Reddy, K., Reconstruction of medial patellofemoral ligament for chronic patellar instability, Indian Journal of Orthopaedics, 46, 4, pp. 447-454, (2012); Rhatomy, Sholahuddin, Evaluation of quadriceps strength post-medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction using quadriceps tendon autografts, Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences, 8, pp. 943-946, (2020)","C.

Purpose: To determine the factors associated with improvement in subjective knee function from 6 to 12 months after ACLR. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 91 patients undergoing primary unilateral ACLR were included. Subjective knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Isokinetic knee strength (quadriceps and hamstring) and Anterior Cruciate Ligament–Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scale scores were also assessed. Patients were included in the poor recovery group if their improvement in the IKDC-SKF score from 6 to 12 months was <15.5 points (minimal detectable change) and their IKDC-SKF score at 12 months was <90 points (maximum, 100 points). The IKDC-SKF score, knee strength, and the ACL-RSI score were compared between the poor recovery and good recovery groups with and without propensity score matching. Matched variables included age, sex, and IKDC-SKF score at 6 months after ACLR. In addition, logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors that discriminated between the poor recovery and good recovery groups. Results: There were 32 participants (35%) allocated to the poor recovery group. Before propensity score matching, the poor recovery group had a significantly older age, lower IKDC-SKF scores at 6 and 12 months, and a lower limb symmetry index (LSI) for quadriceps strength at 6 months. After propensity score matching, the LSI for quadriceps strength at 6 months was significantly different between the poor recovery and good recovery groups (73.0 ± 17.4 vs 83.3 ± 18.2, respectively; P =.039). Logistic regression analysis showed that a lower LSI for quadriceps strength at 6 months was significantly associated with poor recovery of the IKDC-SKF score (odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.98]), and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 80.9% as a cutoff value of the LSI for quadriceps strength with 75.0% sensitivity and 61.0% specificity. Conclusion: A lower LSI for quadriceps strength at 6 months postoperatively was associated with poor recovery of the IKDC-SKF score from 6 to 12 months after ACLR, even after adjusting for confounders. © The Author(s) 2025.","ACL; clinical assessments/grading scales; knee ligaments; patient-reported outcome measures; psychological readiness; rehabilitation; subgroup analysis","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; case control study; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; International Knee Documentation Committee scale; knee function; knee ligament; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; meniscal repair; meniscectomy; minimum detectable change; muscle strength; patient-reported outcome; postoperative period; propensity score; quadriceps femoris muscle; range of motion; receiver operating characteristic; rehabilitation care; return to sport; sensitivity and specificity; surgical technique","","","Biodex System 3, Biodex; JMP Pro 16, SAS","Biodex; SAS","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (JP23K10553)","One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (grant No. JP23K10553).

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is widely used in rehabilitation to improve muscle mass and strength; however, its effects on neuromuscular functions and muscle quality, such as mo-tor unit (MU) behavior and force steadiness (FS), remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of NMES on neuromuscular function and muscle quality in individuals with ACLR who could walk normally. Ten male ACLR patients underwent NMES 3 times weekly for 6 weeks, with 30 contractions per session. Neuromuscular function was assessed via FS, maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), and MU behavior in the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis. Muscle quality was evaluated using muscle thickness (MT), echo intensity (EI), and ultrasound texture features. Measurements were taken at baseline and weeks 3 and 6. NMES significantly improved MVIC, FS, MU behavior, and muscle quali-ty (MT, EI, and homogeneity) on the ACLR side, with significant interac-tion effects observed. At week 3, MVIC and FS showed no significant improvement; however, structural and qualitative muscle changes were evident. NMES effectively enhanced neuromuscular function, MU be-havior, and muscle quality impaired by ACLR. However, a 3-week inter-vention may not be sufficient for optimal neuromuscular recovery, high-lighting the need for extended NMES protocols. © 2025 Korean Society of Exercise Rehabilitation","Anterior cruciate ligament; Motor unit behavior; Muscle quality; Neuromuscular electrical stimu-lation; Neuromuscular function","","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, MOE, (NRF-2022S1A5B5A17050057, NRF-2022R1F1A1076564)","This study was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2022S1A5B5A17050057; NRF-2022R1F1A1076564).","Akima, Hiroshi, Atrophy of thigh muscles after meniscal lesions and arthroscopic partial menisectomy, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 13, 8, pp. 632-637, (2005); Bezerra, Pedro, Effects of electromyostimulation on knee extensors and flexors strength and steadiness in older adults, Journal of Motor Behavior, 43, 5, pp. 413-421, (2011); Davies, George James D., ACL Return to Sport Guidelines and Criteria, Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 307-314, (2017); Enoka, Roger Maro, Force steadiness: From motor units to voluntary actions, Physiology, 36, 2, pp. 114-130, (2021); Farina, Dario, Principles of motor unit physiology evolve with advances in technology, Physiology, 31, 2, pp. 83-94, (2016); Hasegawa, Satoshi, Effect of early implementation of electrical muscle stimulation to prevent muscle atrophy and weakness in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 21, 4, pp. 622-630, (2011); Herda, Trent J., Resistance exercise training and the motor unit, European Journal of Applied Physiology, 122, 9, pp. 2019-2035, (2022); Herrington, Lee C., Quadriceps Strength and Functional Performance after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Professional Soccer players at Time of Return to Sport, Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 35, 3, pp. 769-775, (2021); Hollman, John H., Diminished neuromuscular system adaptability following anterior cruciate ligament injury: Examination of knee muscle force variability and complexity, Clinical Biomechanics, 90, (2021); Ikezoe, Tome, Effects of Low-Load, Higher-Repetition vs. High-Load, Lower-Repetition Resistance Training Not Performed to Failure on Muscle Strength, Mass, and Echo Intensity in Healthy Young Men: A Time-Course Study, Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 34, 12, pp. 3439-3445, (2020)","M.-K.

Methods A total of 53 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the National Institute of Sports Medicine, General Administration of Sport of China from June 2015 to June 2021 and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. The patients were followed up time for at least 2 years. An isometric muscle strength test system was used to measure the strength of bilateral quadriceps and hamstring muscles. The patients were grouped according to whether the limb symmetry index (LSI) of peak torque of quadriceps and hamstring muscle reached 85 % at an angular velocity of 60°/s. Specifically, 26 patients were classified into group A (LSI ≥85%) and 27 patients were classified into group B (LSI < 85%). The subjective function and motor performance of knees were compared between the two groups. Results In terms of subjective function of knees, the international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score (88.76 ± 9.93 vs. 81.08 ± 12.57, P =0.017) and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) (86.27 ± 8.96 vs. 80.22 ± 11.31, P = 0. 036) were different between groups A and B.

Free grafts are avascular and theirs tibial side fixation insufficiency is a potential cause of failure in ACL reconstruction. Tibial attachment preserving hamstring graft preserves the vascularity and mechanical strength on the tibial side, and could be a viable option in an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, The authors describe the early outcome of the surgical technique of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with tibial attachment sparing hamstring graft without implant on the tibial side. Material and methods: The hamstring insertion preserving five stranded graft was used for ACL reconstruction with adjustable endobutton for femoral side fixation and no implant for tibial side fixation. Thirty-six patients with one-year follow-ups were included in the study. Results: The mean length of the prepared graft attached to the tibia was 95.5 ± 4 mm, and the mean width was 8.6 ± 0.7 mm and 8.2 ± 0.6 mm on the tibial and femoral side respectively. None had a failure of graft till the final follow-up. The preoperative International knee documentation committee score (IKDC) mean score improved from 47.3 ± 8.9 to 87.3 ± 6.7 at one-year follow-up. The preoperative Lysholm score (LS) improved from 58.1 ± 12.8 to 90.4 ± 4.9 at one-year follow-up. Conclusion: Attachment-sparing hamstring graft with a femoral side-only implant is a simple, cost-effective technique that provides a satisfactory outcome. © 2023 The Authors","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Femoral side fixation only; Hamstring graft; Tibial attachment preserving","","","","","","","","Janssen, Rob Paulus Augustinus, Intra-articular remodelling of hamstring tendon grafts after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 22, 9, pp. 2102-2108, (2014); Deehan, David John, The biology of intergration of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 87, 7, pp. 889-895, (2005); Sinha, Skand, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with tibial attachment preserving hamstring graft without implant on tibial side, Indian Journal of Orthopaedics, 52, 2, pp. 170-176, (2018); Papachristou, Georgios K., ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus tendon autograft without detachment of its tibial insertion: A histologic study in a rabbit model, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 15, 10, pp. 1175-1180, (2007); Löcherbach, Claus, Biologically enhanced ACL reconstruction, Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research, 96, 7, pp. 810-815, (2010); Lee, Byung-ill, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the tibial-remnant preserving technique using a hamstring graft, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 3, pp. 340-340.e7, (2006); Wagih, Ahmad M., Anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using in situ hamstring graft with 4 tunnels, Arthroscopy Techniques, 3, 1, pp. e49-e56, (2014); Buda, Roberto, Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using distally inserted doubled hamstrings tendons, Orthopedics, 36, 6, pp. 449-453, (2013); RUFFILLI, A., Hamstring graft tibial insertion preservation versus detachment in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective randomized comparative study, European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, 26, 6, pp. 657-664, (2016); Salman Ali, M., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon graft without detachment of the tibial insertion, Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, 126, 9, pp. 644-648, (2006)","V.

The addition of lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) to an ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has been found to reduce the risk of ACL retear in high-risk patients. Purpose: To (1) compare ACL graft maturity using signal intensity ratios (SIRs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in skeletally immature patients undergoing ACLR with QTA either with or without concomitant LET and (2) evaluate LET safety by calculating the physeal disturbance-related reoperation rate in the ACLR+LET group. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The records of patients aged ≤18 years who underwent ACLR between 2015 and 2021 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients undergoing ACLR with QTA who had open distal femoral and proximal tibial physes on MRI scans and a minimum 2-year follow-up data were included. SIR values were measured on sagittal MRI scans by averaging the signal at 3 regions of interest along the ACL graft and dividing by the signal of the posterior cruciate ligament at its insertion. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate differences in SIR values at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively in patients who underwent ACLR alone versus ACLR+LET. Results: Overall, 29 patients were included in the study: 16 patients in the ACLR+LET group and 13 patients in the ACLR-only group. There were no significant differences in SIR values between groups at the 6-month or 1-year postoperative timepoints. At 2 years postoperatively, the median SIR of the ACLR+LET group was significantly lower than that of the ACLR-only group on both univariate (1.33 vs 1.86, respectively, P =.0012) and multivariate regression analyses adjusting for both sex and surgical technique (β = -0.49 [95% CI, -0.91 to -0.05]; P =.029). There were no cases of reoperation for physeal disturbance in patients who underwent ACLR+LET. Conclusion: The addition of LET to an ACLR with QTA was associated with lower average SIR values and thus improved graft maturity at 2 years postoperatively compared with ACLR alone in skeletally immature patients. The addition of LET to an ACLR was found to be safe in skeletally immature patients. © The Author(s) 2024.","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; pediatrics; quadriceps tendon autograft; sports","polyetheretherketone; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; Article; athlete; autograft; clinical article; cohort analysis; communication software; distal femur; epiphysiodesis; epiphysis; female; femoral condyle; fluoroscopy; follow up; fracture fixation; hamstring tendon; human; incision; lateral extra articular tenodesis; lateral meniscal repair; male; medial meniscal repair; meniscal repair; meniscectomy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; operation duration; partial lateral meniscectomy; partial weight bearing; physical parameters; posterior cruciate ligament; postoperative period; proximal tibia; quadriceps tendon autograft; range of motion; rehabilitation care; reoperation; retrospective study; signal intensity ratio; surgical technique; tendon graft; tenodesis","","polyetheretherketone, 31694-16-3","1.5-T magnet, General Electric; 3.0-T magnet, General Electric; FiberStick, Arthrex; FlipCutter, Arthrex; Sectra IDS7, Sectra; STATA Version 17.0, StataCorp; SwiveLock, Arthrex; TightRope, Arthrex; Vicryl suture, Ethicon","General Electric; General Electric; Arthrex; Arthrex; Sectra; StataCorp; Arthrex; Arthrex; Ethicon","","","Aitchison, Alexandra Hunter, MRI Signal Intensity of Quadriceps Tendon Autograft and Hamstring Tendon Autograft 1 Year After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Adolescent Athletes, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 49, 13, pp. 3502-3507, (2021); Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Cavaignac, Etienne, Hamstring Graft Incorporation According to the Length of the Graft Inside Tunnels, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 46, 2, pp. 348-356, (2018); Cavaignac, Etienne, Effect of Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis on Anterior Cruciate Ligament Graft Incorporation, Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 8, 11, (2020); Chu, Constance R., Quantitative MRI UTE-T2* and T2* Show Progressive and Continued Graft Maturation Over 2 Years in Human Patients After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 7, 8, (2019); Chung, Seok-won, Changes in Perianchor Cyst Formation Over Time After Rotator Cuff Repair: Influential Factors and Outcomes, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 47, 1, pp. 165-172, (2019); Dean, Robert S., Combined Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and Lateral Extra-Articular Tenodesis in Skeletally Immature Patients: Surgical Technique, Arthroscopy Techniques, 9, 7, pp. e897-e903, (2020); Delaloye, Jean Romain, Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction and Modified Lemaire Lateral Extra-Articular Tenodesis Similarly Improve Knee Stability After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Biomechanical Study, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 36, 7, pp. 1942-1950, (2020); Engebretsen, Lars, The effect of an iliotibial tenodesis on intraarticular graft forces and knee joint motion, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 2, pp. 169-176, (1990); Falconiero, Robert P., Revascularization and ligamentization of autogenous anterior cruciate ligament grafts in humans, Arthroscopy, 14, 2, pp. 197-205, (1998)","D.W.

Little is known about the changes in dynamic function and activation during jogging in patients with ACLD. Methods: Twenty patients with an injured ACL before ACL reconstruction (ACLD group) and nine healthy male volunteers (control group) were recruited. Each volunteer repeated the jogging experiment five times. Based on the experimental data measured, a musculoskeletal multibody dynamics model was employed to simulate the tibiofemoral joint dynamics during jogging. Eighteen muscles were used for analysis. The obtained dynamics data were used for clustering and curve difference analysis. Results: The 18 muscles studied were divided into 3 categories. All the quadriceps, the soleus, the gastrocnemius, and the popliteus were classified as label 1. All the hamstrings were classified as label 2, and the sartorius muscles were classified as label 3. Among them, the classification of the short head of the biceps femoris was significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.001). The force curves of all 18 muscles and the between-group differences were studied according to clustered categories. Most muscle force in label 1 was approaching zero in the terminal stance phase, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The muscle force in label 2 had areas with significant differences in the stance phase. Muscle force in label 3 was significantly lower than that in the control group in the pre-swing phase. Conclusions: This study showed that there are various changes of muscle function and activation in patients with ACLD. Through clustering and curve analysis, the joint reactions and changes of different muscle forces in the gait cycle between the ACLD and control groups could be further clarified. © 2023, The Author(s).","Anterior cruciate ligament deficiency; Clustering; Dynamics; Gait analysis; Muscle force","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; biceps femoris muscle; controlled study; gait; gastrocnemius muscle; hamstring muscle; human; jogging; lower limb; male; muscle function; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; sartorius muscle; simulation; soleus muscle; standing; tibiofemoral joint; young adult","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11872074); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, (L222138)","This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 11872074), Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (Grant No: L222138).","Barenius, Björn, Increased risk of osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A 14-year follow-up study of a randomized controlled trial, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 42, 5, pp. 1049-1057, (2014); Wellsandt, Elizabeth A., Decreased Knee Joint Loading Associated with Early Knee Osteoarthritis after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 44, 1, pp. 143-151, (2016); Zhang, Yu, Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries Alter the Kinematics of Knees with or Without Meniscal Deficiency, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 44, 12, pp. 3132-3139, (2016); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Hurd, Wendy J., Knee instability after acute ACL rupture affects movement patterns during the mid-stance phase of gait, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 25, 10, pp. 1369-1377, (2007); Ren, Shuang, Three dimensional knee kinematics and kinetics in ACL-deficient patients with and without medial meniscus posterior horn tear during level walking, Gait and Posture, 66, pp. 26-31, (2018); Bennett, Hunter J., Walking lower extremity biomechanics of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, Journal of Biomechanics, 119, (2021); Kiernan, Damien, Lower limb biomechanics during gait in children with Achondroplasia, Journal of Biomechanics, 119, (2021); Kulkarni, Snehal, Basic gait pattern and impact of fall risk factors on gait among older adults in India, Gait and Posture, 88, pp. 16-21, (2021); Bohn, Marie Bagger, Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic analysis of knee rotational stability in ACL-deficient patients during walking, running and pivoting, Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics, 3, 1, (2016)","Q.

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to examine factors that affect quadriceps muscle strength 1 year after ACLR. It was hypothesized that older age, poor preoperative quadriceps muscle strength, and residual pain would be risk factors for poor quadriceps muscle strength recovery. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Included were patients from multiple institutions who underwent primary ACLR using autologous hamstring tendon grafts between August 1, 2013, and March 31, 2018, and who had at least 1 year of follow-up data. Patients with past ligamentous injuries in the affected knee, previous injuries or operations in the contralateral knee, accompanying ligament injuries of grade 2 or 3, or inflammatory or other types of osteoarthritis were excluded. Patients were categorized as having muscle strength ≥80% (good strength recovery) or <80% (poor strength recovery) compared with the contralateral leg at 1 year postoperatively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the factors influencing postoperative quadriceps muscle strength. In addition, a categorical analysis was conducted based on factors extracted by the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 402 patients were included. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age at surgery (P =.020), preoperative quadriceps muscle strength (P =.006), and postoperative Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)-Pain score (P =.002) were significantly associated with quadriceps muscle strength at 1 year postoperatively. The odds of poor muscle strength recovery according to categorical analysis were 5.0-fold higher for patients aged >40 versus ≤20 years, 4.2-fold higher for those with preoperative quadriceps muscle index <60% versus ≥80%, and 7.7-fold higher for those with a postoperative KOOS-Pain score of <85 versus 100. Conclusion: Older age, poor preoperative quadriceps muscle strength, and low postoperative KOOS-Pain score were risk factors for poor quadriceps muscle strength 1 year after primary ACLR. Surgical indications, including age, preoperative active rehabilitation, and pain control, should be considered for optimization of postoperative quadriceps muscle strength recovery. © The Author(s) 2023.","anterior cruciate ligament; hamstring tendon; knee ligaments; meniscus; quadriceps muscle strength; risk factor","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; Article; autograft; body mass; follow up; hamstring muscle; hamstring tendon; health care personnel; human; knee function; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; knee instability; knee meniscus; knee radiography; ligament injury; ligament surgery; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; medial meniscus; muscle strength; muscle training; operation duration; osteoarthritis; pain; patient satisfaction; physical activity; preoperative evaluation; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; range of motion; residual pain; risk factor; scoring system; Tegner activity score; tendon graft","","","Biodex System 4, Biodex; KT-1000, MED Metric","Biodex; MED Metric","","","Akoto, Ralph, ACL reconstruction with quadriceps tendon graft and press-fit fixation versus quadruple hamstring graft and interference screw fixation - A matched pair analysis after one year follow up, BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, 20, 1, (2019); Asano, Hiroshi, Evaluation of clinical factors affecting knee pain after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction., The journal of knee surgery, 15, 1, pp. 23-28, (2002); Baker, Champ L., Long-term outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in patients 60 years and older, Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 12, pp. 1-4, (2014); Blyth, Mark John Graham, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in patients over the age of 50 years: 2- To 8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 11, 4, pp. 204-211, (2003); de Jong, Suzanne N., Functional Assessment and Muscle Strength Before and After Reconstruction of Chronic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Lesions, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 23, 1, pp. 21-21.e11, (2007); Eitzen, Ingrid, Preoperative quadriceps strength is a significant predictor of knee function two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 43, 5, pp. 371-376, (2009); Gadéa, François, Knee pain after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Evaluation of a rehabilitation protocol, European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, 24, 5, pp. 789-795, (2014); Gobbi, Alberto W., Comparison of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in male and female athletes using the patellar tendon and hamstring autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 6, pp. 534-539, (2004); Hanada, Mitsuru, Muscle recovery at 1 year after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery is associated with preoperative and early postoperative muscular strength of the knee extension, European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, 29, 8, pp. 1759-1764, (2019); Hess, Thomas, Single- versus two-incision technique in anterior cruciate ligament replacement: Influence on postoperative muscle function, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 1, pp. 27-31, (2002)","H.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate radiographic bone TW and clinical outcomes in patients with ACLR performed with suspensory fixation on both the femoral and tibial tunnels using different soft tissue grafts. Methods: Patients who underwent primary ACLR with a soft tissue graft (hamstring autograft or allograft or quadriceps autograft) using an all-inside technique were included for analysis. Anterior cruciate ligament tunnel width was measured postoperatively on anteroposterior and lateral plain radiographs at a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form as well as assessing patient records for complication data. Results: Fifty patients (15 quadriceps autografts, 24 hamstring autografts, 11 hamstring allografts) were included in this study. The quadriceps autograft cohort was the young-est, (16.6 ± 2.8 years), followed by the hamstring autograft cohort (27.7 ± 9.0 years), and the hamstring allograft cohort (48.2 ± 9.4 years; p < 0.001) for all comparisons. Quadriceps autografts experienced less tibial tunnel-widening (0.6 ± 0.6 mm) than hamstring autografts (2.0 ± 1.1 mm; p = 0.011), which, in turn, experienced less widening than hamstring allografts (3.9 ± 2.3 mm; p < 0.001). Quadriceps autografts also experienced less femoral tunnel widening (0.3 ± 0.6 mm) than hamstring autografts (2.1 ± 1.2 mm; p < 0.001) which, in turn, experienced less tunnel-widening than hamstring allografts (4.0 ± 2.1; p < 0.001). At follow-up, mean IKDC for hamstring autografts, quadriceps autografts, and hamstring allografts were 79.9 ± 17.9, 88.5 ± 7.1, and 77.7 ± 20.4, respectively (p = 0.243). There was no statisti-cally significant difference between groups with respect to postoperative complications; p = 0.874. Conclusions: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadriceps autograft resulted in the least tunnel widening compared to hamstring autograft and allograft when using an all-inside suspensory fixation device. Both autograft groups resulted in less widening than the allograft group. Despite the greatest increased radiographic tunnel widening in the allograft group, there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee laxity. © 2023, J. Michael Ryan Publishing Inc..

In this paper, knee joint function and walking were considered possible ones. Method: The study included 21 subjects with acute ACL tear and 20 healthy volunteers as a control group. Biomechanical gait analysis was performed using the inertial sensor system including EMG recording. All subjects (but for controls) were divided into two groups: Group 1—“up to 4 weeks” and Group 2—“from 4 weeks to 3 months”. Results: Temporal gait parameters in subjects from Group 1 demonstrate the asymmetry of 4% and more in terms of the gait cycle with a decrease in the affected limb, and are within normal range in Group 2. The amplitudes at the hip and knee joints in the affected limb are reduced which is especially pronounced in Group 1 (2–4 and 6–10 degrees, respectively). The affected knee joint shows a decrease in the range of motion by up to 5 degrees in the first half of the stance phase and flexion by less than 40 degrees in the swing phase. The tibialis anterior and quadriceps femoris muscle function is decreased in the affected limb only in Group 1 (72% and 78% from normal, respectively). Conclusions: The severity of the condition after an ACL tear is largely determined by functional changes. The time factor is of secondary importance. © 2023 by the authors.","acute form; anterior cruciate ligament tear; gait analysis; knee joint","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; electromyography; female; gait; hip joint; human; joint function; knee joint; male; muscle function; quadriceps femoris muscle; range of motion; standing; tibialis anterior muscle; time factor; walking","","","Stadis system, Neurosoft","Neurosoft","","The study was funded as part of the government assignment to FNKC FMBA, state registration no. 20.004.21.800.","Kaeding, Christopher C., Epidemiology and Diagnosis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 36, 1, pp. 1-8, (2017); Paudel, Yuba Raj, Increasing incidence of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a 17-year population-based study, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 31, 1, pp. 248-255, (2023); Lee, Dae-hee, Effect of time after anterior cruciate ligament tears on proprioception and postural stability, PLoS ONE, 10, 9, (2015); Manual of Arthroscopic Surgery, (2002); Cipolla, Massimo, Different patterns of meniscal tears in acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures and in chronic ACL-deficient knees - Classification, staging and timing of treatment, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 3, pp. 130-134, (1995); Shelbourne, K.

Purpose: To analyze the pattern of injury, return to play (RTP), and performance of a consecutive series of elite professional soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We evaluated the medical records of 40 consecutive elite soccer players who underwent ACLR by a single surgeon between September 2018 and May 2022. Patient age, height, weight, body mass index, position, injury history, affected side, RTP time, minutes played per season (MPS), and MPS as a percentage of playable minutes before and after ACLR were retrieved from medical records and from publicly available media-based platforms. Results: Included were 27 male patients (mean ± SD age at surgery, 23.2 ± 4.3 years; range, 18-34 years). The injury occurred during matches in 24 players (88.9%), with a noncontact mechanism in 22 (91.7%). Meniscal pathology was found in 21 patients (77.8%). Lateral meniscectomy and meniscal repair were performed in 2 (7.4%) and 14 (51.9%) patients, respectively, and medial meniscectomy and meniscal repair were performed in 3 (11.1%) and 13 (48.1%) patients, respectively. A total of 17 players (63.0%) underwent ACLR with bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft and 10 (37.0%) with soft tissue quadriceps tendon. Lateral extra-articular tenodesis was added in 5 patients (18.5%). The overall RTP rate was 92.6% (25 of 27). Two athletes moved to a lower league after surgery. The mean MPS% during the last preinjury season was 56.69% ± 21.71%; this decreased significantly to 29.18% ± 20.6% (P <.001) in the first postoperative season and then increased to 57.76% ± 22.89% and 55.89% ± 25.8% in the second and third postoperative seasons. Two (7.4%) reruptures and 2 (7.4%) failed meniscal repairs were reported. Conclusion: ACLR in elite UEFA soccer players was associated with a 92.6% rate of RTP and 7.4% rate of reinjury within 6 months after primary surgery. Moreover, 7.4% of soccer players moved to a lower league during the first season after surgery. Age, graft selection, concomitant treatments, and lateral extra-articular tenodesis were not significantly associated with prolonged RTP. © The Author(s) 2023.","ACL injury; ACL reconstruction; associated injuries; elite athletes; LET; return to play; soccer","adult; age; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; anthropometry; Article; athlete; body mass; bone transplantation; chondroplasty; clinical article; demographics; elite athlete; elite United European Football Association soccer players; height; human; lateral extra articular tenodesis; male; meniscectomy; patellofemoral joint; quadriceps tendon; retrospective study; return to sport; soccer player; tenodesis","","","","","","","Balendra, Ganesh, Factors affecting return to play and graft re-rupture after primary ACL reconstruction in professional footballers, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 30, 7, pp. 2200-2208, (2022); Barth, Kathryn A., The negative impact of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in professional male footballers, Knee, 26, 1, pp. 142-148, (2019); Bonanzinga, Tommaso, High return to sport rate and few re-ruptures at long term in professional footballers after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstrings, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 30, 11, pp. 3681-3688, (2022); Daruwalla, Jimmy Hoshang, Rates and determinants of return to play after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in NCAA division 1 college football athletes: A study of the ACC, SEC, and PAC-12 conferences, Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 8, (2014); Della Villa, Francesco D., Infographic.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries can lead to joint instability and complications such as osteoarthritis. Despite this, there is a lack of material models capable of predicting damage at a localized fiber level, hindering our ability to understand how damage develops in real-time. This work develops a continuum-damage material model of the ACL and applies the model to a finite element simulation of the knee undergoing high quadriceps tendon loading. Using quadriceps tendon loadings of 1000, 1500, and 2000 N, the development of microstructural damage within the ACL tissue was examined, and the effects of localized damage on the joint kinematics were investigated. Damage tended to develop in the midsubstance of the ACL in the present model in the anterior medial bundle region and could induce significant changes in the joint kinematics. Using this model, new insights into the development of ACL injury mechanisms can be investigated. © © 2023 by ASME.","","Continuum damage mechanics; Joints (anatomy); Knee prostheses; Ligaments; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Computational investigation; High loadings; Joint kinematics; Knee joint; Localised; Material modeling; Micro-structural damages; Real- time; Tendons; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; comparative study; finite element analysis; geometry; kinematics; knee joint; knee meniscus; ligament; quadriceps tendon; shear stress; tibia; anterior cruciate ligament; biomechanics; human; knee; knee injury; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Biomechanical Phenomena; Humans; Knee; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint","","","","","","","Dienst, Michael, Correlation of intercondylar notch cross sections to the ACL size: A high resolution MR tomographic in vivo analysis, Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, 127, 4, pp. 253-260, (2007); Yaru, Nicholas C., The effect of tibial attachment site on graft impingement in an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 217-220, (1992); Lipps, David B., Morphologic characteristics help explain the gender difference in peak anterior cruciate ligament strain during a simulated pivot landing, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, 1, pp. 32-40, (2012); Oh, Youkeun, What strains the anterior cruciate ligament during a pivot landing?, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, 3, pp. 574-583, (2012); Lipps, David B., Anterior cruciate ligament fatigue failures in knees subjected to repeated simulated pivot landings, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, 5, pp. 1058-1066, (2013); Yu, Bing, Mechanisms of non-contact ACL injuries, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, SUPPL. 1, pp. i47-i51, (2007); Sigurdsson, Haraldur B., Timing, not magnitude, of force may explain sex-dependent risk of ACL injury, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 26, 8, pp. 2424-2429, (2018); Roos, Harald P., Osteoarthritis of the knee after injury to the anterior cruciate ligament or meniscus: the influence of time and age, Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, 3, 4, pp. 261-267, (1995); Inaba, H.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the gain in muscle strength in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles in patients following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery, using exercises with and without blood flow restriction. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial, in which 50% (n = 14) of the participants were allocated to the intervention group and the remaining 50% (n = 14) to the control group. The study included the participation of postoperative patients, with reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. RESULTS: After comparing the rehabilitation of the groups, a statistical difference was observed in the quadriceps with an increase in muscle strength (p < 0.01) after 12 weeks and an increase in muscle strength hamstrings (p < 0.01) after 8 and 12 weeks in the injured legs of the intervention group compared to the control. In the analysis of the participants' physical function, there was an significant increase difference in the Lysholm questionnaire (p < 0.01) after 8 and 12 weeks, in the KOOS pain questionnaire (p < 0.01) after 4 weeks a decrease was observed, symptoms and daily activities (p < 0.01) after 8 and 12 weeks, quality of life (p < 0.01) after 12 weeks, and in the IKDC questionnaire (p < 0.01) after 8 and 12 weeks there was an significant increase difference of the intervention group compared to the control. CONCLUSION: After anterior cruciate ligament surgery, exercises with blood flow restriction proved more efficient for improving the muscle strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings, and the physical function of the knee than the same exercises without blood flow restriction.","","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; controlled study; hamstring muscle; human; knee; muscle strength; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Hamstring Muscles; Humans; Knee Joint; Muscle Strength; Quality of Life","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","16501977","","","36190389","English","J Rehabil Med","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141003482"

This study evaluated the effectiveness of an isokinetic training protocol on muscular imbalances in soccer players who underwent ACL surgery. Twenty-four elite male soccer players who were found to have strength imbalances six months post-surgery were recruited and randomly assigned to either the control or the experimental group. The isokinetic knee strength was assessed before and after the 5-week intervention program. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of training intervention on torque production for the quadriceps [F(1,22)= 34.95, p<0.001, η2<inf>p</inf> = 0.61] and the hamstring [F(1,22)= 11.49, p<0.05, η2<inf>p</inf> = 0.34] of the operated leg. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between the exercise condition and torque production for the quadriceps [F(1,22)= 23.46, p<0.001, η2<inf>p</inf> = 0.52] and the hamstring of the operated leg [F(1,22)=6.27, p<0.05, η2<inf>p</inf> = 0.22]. Planned comparisons revealed that the experimental group produced significantly greater quadriceps [t(11)=-5.42, p<0.01, d=1.22] and hamstring [t(11)=-3.09, p<0.01, d=0.45] torque post-training compared to the pre-training intervention. Additionally, there was a main effect of training intervention on the deficits of the quadriceps [F(1,22)=67.95, p<0.01, η2<inf>p</inf> = 0.76] and a significant interaction between the exercise intervention and quadriceps deficits for the two groups [F(1,22)= 32.48, p<0.001, η<inf>p</inf>2= 0.59]. Our results indicate that the isokinetic training program efficiently restored the muscular imbalances post-surgery, and therefore physical therapists and rehabilitation experts should consider incorporating this program into their therapy protocols. © 2022 by authors, all rights reserved.","Imbalances; Knee Asymmetries; Post-Surgery; Rehabilitation","","","","","","","","Rochcongar, Pierre, Ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament in soccer, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 5, pp. 372-378, (2009); Boden, Barry P., Mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injury, Orthopedics, 23, 6, pp. 573-578, (2000); Myer, Gregory D., Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Criteria-based progression through the return-to-sport phase, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 36, 6, pp. 385-402, (2006); Mohtadi, Nicholas G.H., Reruptures, reinjuries, and revisions at a minimum 2-year follow-up: A randomized clinical trial comparing 3 graft types for ACL reconstruction, Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 26, 2, pp. 96-107, (2016); Webster, Kate E., Younger patients are at increased risk for graft rupture and contralateral injury after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 42, 3, pp. 641-647, (2014); Int J Sports Phys Ther, (2018); Fältström, Anne, High Risk of New Knee Injuries in Female Soccer Players After Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction at 5- to 10-Year Follow-up, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 49, 13, pp. 3479-3487, (2021); Kyritsis, Polyvios, Likelihood of ACL graft rupture: Not meeting six clinical discharge criteria before return to sport is associated with a four times greater risk of rupture, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 50, 15, pp. 946-951, (2016); Grindem, Hege, Simple decision rules can reduce reinjury risk by 84% after ACL reconstruction: The Delaware-Oslo ACL cohort study, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 50, 13, pp. 804-808, (2016); Isokinetics in Human Performance, (2000)","","","Horizon Research Publishing","","","","","","23814381","","","","English","Intern.

The ACL-return to sports after injury (RSI) scale was developed based on subcategories of emotions, confidence in physical performance and risk appraisal. However, it has not been clarified describing which is the most influential psychological factor of the ACL-RSI scale. Hypothesis: Risk appraisal is the most influent for return to sports in the subcategories of the ACL-RSI scale. Patients and Methods: A total of 85 competitive patients who had undergone ACLR were evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. They were classified the return to sports (RTS) group and non-return to sports (NRTS) group. Evaluations were several clinical and functional scores including Cincinnati knee rating system, Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, limitation in activities of daily living (ADL) and sports which estimated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, Isokinetic Muscle Strength (quadriceps and hamstrings), single hop test and anterior laxity. They were investigated on their relationship with the ACL-RSI scale including each subcategory. Results: The total ACL-RSI scale significantly improved at each point. Of the subcategories, only risk appraisal was not significantly different at each point (p = 0.21 and p = 0.13). There was a significant difference at 24 months after ACLR between the RTS group and NRTS group. In terms of risk appraisal, compared with emotion and performance confidence, the difference in the mean value was the most divergent (RTS group: 55.9 ± 22.7 and NRTS group: 23.8 ± 19.3) and took time to improve through 24 months. Among various clinical and functional scores, there were significant differences in the VAS score for sports, KOOS-symptoms, sports and QOL, Cincinnati Knee Rating System-cut, and single hop test values between two groups. Of these, the KOOS-QOL and VAS score for sports showed particularly strong correlations with ACL-RSI risk appraisal (r = 0.75 and –0.68, respectively). Conclusion: Of the ACL-RSI scale, risk appraisal took the longest time to improve and strongly affected the return to sports. The KOOS-QOL and VAS score for sports were most strongly correlated with the ACL-RSI risk appraisal. It seems that it is important to reduce the psychological risk as soon as possible after ACL injury in ACLR patients.

Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, United States","Background: Multiple graft options exist for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in an adolescent athlete. Patellar tendon harvest can lead to anterior knee pain, while hamstring tendon harvest can affect knee flexion strength and alter mechanics. Allograft is less desirable in pediatric patients due to the higher failure rate and slight risk of disease transmission. Quadriceps tendon autograft has rarely been reported for adolescent ACL reconstruction in the USA, but is an excellent option due to its large size, low donor site morbidity, and versatility. The purpose of this study is to report the outcomes of adolescents who have undergone ACL reconstruction using quadriceps tendon autograft. Methods: Twenty-two ACL reconstructions using the quadriceps autograft were performed on 21 pediatric patients by the senior author between 2010 and 2017. The patient’s demographics, injury characteristics, imaging, physical examination findings, operative findings, outcomes and sports were recorded. Results: The average age at the time of surgery was 15 years. Two patients had open physes; the remainder had closing physes. 64% of patients had additional meniscal tears and 76% had bony contusions. The average duration of follow-up was 2.8 years (range 2–5 years). At final follow-up, there were no angular deformities or leg length discrepancies. The average quadriceps atrophy of the operative leg was 4 mm. The average Lysholm score was 98. 86% of patients returned to sports. No patients had re-rupture of their operative ACL. No incidences of infections, numbness, or anterior knee pain were reported. Two patients had a second arthroscopy for re-injury, revealing new meniscal tears but intact ACL grafts. Conclusions: Use of quadriceps tendon autograft for ACL reconstruction in adolescent patients allows reliable return to sport with minimal complications.

Thirtyfour participants were randomly allocated to either NMES+group, who received standard rehabilitation with additional NMES of knee flexor and extensor muscles, superimposed on functional movements, or to a control group, who received no additional training (NAT) to traditional rehabilitation. Participants were assessed 15 (T1), 30 (T2), 60 (T3), 90 (T4) and at a mean of 380 days (T5) after ACLr. Knee strength of flexors and extensors was measured at T3, T4 and T5. Lower limb loading asymmetry was measured during a sit-to-stand-to-sit movement at T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5, and a countermovement-jump at T4 and T5. An MRI was performed at T5 to assess morphology of thigh muscles and regeneration of the harvested tendons. NMES+showed higher muscle strength for the hamstrings (T4, T5) and the quadriceps (T3, T4, T5), higher loading symmetry during stand-to-sit (T2, T3, T4, T5), sit-to-stand (T3, T4) and countermovementjump (T5) than NAT. No differences were found between-groups for morphology of muscles and tendons, nor in regeneration of harvested tendons. NMES+ early after ACLr with hamstring graft improves muscle strength and knee function in the short- and long-term after surgery, regardless of tendon regeneration. © Journal of Sports Science and Medicine (2022).","Electrical stimulation; Knee; Rehabilitation; Resistance training; Semitendinosus","anterior cruciate ligament injury; controlled study; hamstring muscle; hamstring tendon; human; physiology; randomized controlled trial; regeneration; tendon; transplantation; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Hamstring Muscles; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Regeneration; Tendons","","","","","","This study was financially supported by a research grant from DJO Global.

There is a controversy in neuromuscular control changes on the uninvolved side. We intended to evaluate the steadiness and accuracy of quadriceps muscle control in the healthy and deficient sides of people with acute ACL rupture. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, thirteen men with ACL rupture (age: 27.8±7.0, body mass index (BMI): 24.7±2.25: 24.7, days from injury: 48.1±21.3) participated in the study. We measured quadriceps force control, which is quantitatively assessed by the standard deviation (SD) of joint torque for a predefined submaximal target. The accuracy of muscular control or performance of quadriceps is commonly quantified by the root mean square of error (RMSE) was also measured. A two-way analysis of variance was conducted to assess SD and RMSE of two levels of quadriceps contraction (30% of muscle voluntary contraction (MVC), 50% of MVC) across both healthy and deficient knees. Results: There was a significant main effect for SD and RMSE of MVC percentage (p<0.001). SD of quadriceps torque in 50% of MVC (1.44 ± 0.13) was higher than 30% of MVC (0.88 ± 0.1). In contrast, there was no significant main effect for SD and RMSE of knee condition. Conclusion: After unilateral ACL rupture, the neuromuscular system becomes defected and quadriceps muscle control is then reduced in the healthy side. Therefore, the healthy side is also vulnerable to ligamentous damage. Besides, with the increasing intensity of physical activities, neuromuscular control decreases and the risk of re-injury rises. © 2022 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

Methods: Eighteen soccer players who underwent ACLR and 18 normal soccer players were enrolled in this investigation (ACLR group; age, 26.11 ± 3.95 years; body mass index, 23.52 ± 2.69 kg/m2; surgery time, 5 ± 3.30 years: control group; age, 25.83 ± 3.51 years; body mass index, 24.09 ± 3.73 kg/m2, respectively). Participants were evaluated during the landing maneuver before and after carrying out the high-intensity exercise bout using the Wingate test. The intensity of the exercise was defined as a blood lactate accumulation of at least 4 mmol/L. The dependent variables included sagittal-plane kinematics and kinetics of the ankle, knee and hip joints, and electromyography activity of the gastrocnemius, hamstrings, quadriceps, and gluteus maximus. Results: On 2 × 2 analysis of variance, none of the dependent variable showed significant exercise×group interactions. Regardless of group, significant main effects of exercise were found. Post-exercise landing was characterized by increased flexion of hip (p = 0.01), knee (p = 0.001), and ankle joints (p = 0.002); increased extension moments of hip (p = 0.009), knee (p = 0.012), and ankle joints (p = 0.003), as well as decreased quadriceps activity (p = 0.007). Conclusion: At 1 year or more post-ACLR, the effect of the high-intensity exercise bout on landing biomechanics is not expected to differ from that experienced by healthy soccer players. © 2021, The Author(s).","ACL reconstruction; Fatigue; High-intensity exercise; Landing biomechanics; Soccer","lactic acid; adult; ankle dorsiflexion; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; biomechanics; body mass; controlled study; electromyography; exercise intensity; female; gastrocnemius muscle; gluteus maximus muscle; hamstring muscle; high intensity exercise; human; human experiment; joint function; kinematics; knee function; lactate blood level; male; muscle contraction; operation duration; quadriceps femoris muscle; quasi experimental study; soccer player","","lactic acid, 113-21-3, 50-21-5","","","Majmaah University, MU, (R-2021-59)","The authors would like to thank Deanship of Scientific Research at Majmaah University for supporting this work under project number: R-2021-59.

Design: A total of 52 knees in 50 consecutive patients with medial plica syndrome (MPS) were enrolled to prospective study. Preoperatively the age, gender, level of activity, symptoms’ duration, Lysholm knee scoring scale (LKSS), Q angle, range of motion (ROM), and quadriceps output torque (QOT) were recorded. The plica was then arthroscopically excised while plica morphological type and cartilage lesions (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] classification) were registered. The postoperative evaluation was done after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 3 years, and 10 years. The final assessment after 10 years covered LKSS, ROM, QOT, and was enriched with functional tests: the single leg squat test (SLS), the modified Ober test (MO), and the manual palpation of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO). Results: The mean LKSS increased from 52 (15-85, SD 16.479) preoperative to 80 (48-100, SD 15.711) at final follow-up examination. A significant negative correlation was found between LKSS and the patients’ age. Cartilage lesions higher than ICRS 1 significantly decreased the final LKSS. Results were significantly better in the subgroups with normal outcome of functional tests. Conclusions: Clinical results of arthroscopic plica resection are better in patients without coexisting cartilage lesions. Poor neuromuscular control may contribute to abnormal patella tracking, leading to both medial plica irritation and further cartilage deterioration. © The Author(s) 2019.","arthroscopy; joint involved; knee; medial plica; procedures; synovial shelf","adult; aerobic exercise; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anthroscopic medial plica syndrome; arthroscopic resection; arthroscopic surgery; Article; cartilage injury; controlled study; cycling; dancing; deterioration; femoral condyle; follow up; human; jogging; knee disease; knee function; Lysholm knee scoring scale; major clinical study; maximum voluntary isometric contraction; outcome assessment; preoperative evaluation; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; range of motion; vastus medialis muscle; arthroscopy; patella; pathology; procedures; synovitis; Arthroscopy; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Patella; Prospective Studies; Synovitis","","","","","","","Ogata, Satoshi, The development of synovial plicae in human knee joints: An embryologic study, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 6, 4, pp. 315-321, (1990); Kang, Seungcheol, MRI findings of young male soldiers with atraumatic anterior knee pain, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 26, 5, pp. 572-578, (2016); Philippot, Rémi, The role of the medial ligamentous structures on patellar tracking during knee flexion, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 20, 2, pp. 331-336, (2012); Felício, Lílian Ramiro, Analysis of patellar stabilizers muscles and patellar kinematics in anterior knee pain subjects, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 21, 1, pp. 148-153, (2011); Sznajderman, Tal, Medial plica syndrome, Israel Medical Association Journal, 11, 1, pp. 54-57, (2009); Kim, Sungjae, The Relationship Between the MPP Test and Arthroscopically Found Medial Patellar Plica Pathology, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 23, 12, pp. 1303-1308, (2007); Griffith, Chad J., Medial plica irritation: Diagnosis and treatment, Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine, 1, 1, pp. 53-60, (2008); Amatuzzi, Marco Martins, Pathologic synovial plica of the knee: Results of conservative treatment, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 5, pp. 466-469, (1990); Paczesny, L., Medial plica syndrome of the knee: Diagnosis with dynamic sonography, Radiology, 251, 2, pp. 439-446, (2009); Herrington, Lee C., Q-angle undervalued?

Tissue stiffness measurement by ultrasound elastography is commonly used for internal organs and tendons. In this study, rectus femoris, vastus media-lis, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus muscles’ stiffness of patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery was followed up by ultrasound elastography. Methods. 19 male recreational athletes aged between 18-40 years who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery with semitendinosus grafting meth-od were included in the study. All patients received a standardized home exercise program and a standardized supervised rehabilitation program. Thigh muscle stiffness measurements were performed at post-operative first-week, first-month, second-month, and third-month. Results. There was a significant difference between non-operated and operated knees at first measurement (p < 0.05). The second measurement was higher than the first, and the third measurement was higher than the second for both legs (p < 0.05). Rehabilitation process has increased muscle stiffness of both legs, and there was still a significant difference between non-operated and operated knees at third month (p < 0.05). Conclusions. Post-operatively decreased thigh muscle stiffness increases with physical rehabilitation. Therefore, ultrasound elastography can be used as an additional follow-up tool. Moreover, theoretically it might be a return to sports criteria if base-line values are available. © 2021, CIC Edizioni Internazionali s.r.l..

The purpose of the study was to measure the in-vivo thickness of the available autograft options around the knee and to seek a correlation between the thickness of the tendons and the anthropometric data, patellar thickness and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) footprint sagittal diameter. Magnetic resonance imaging of 104 consecutive patients with suspected knee injuries were utilized for measurement of the in vivo thickness of pes anserinus tendon (diameter and cross-sectional area [CSA]), patellar tendon (PT) and quadriceps tendon (QT). Pearson’s coefficient was used to find out the relationship between the tendon thickness and anthropometric data, thickness of patella and ACL tibial foot print sagittal diameter. The mean diameters and CSA of the semitendinosus tendon (ST) and gracilis tendon (GT) were 3.77±0.49 mm, 11.62±1.62 mm2and 2.87±0.27 mm, 6.64±1.18 mm2respectively. QT and PT thicknesses were 7.36±0.87 mm and 4.50±0.62 mm respectively. Height and the patellar thickness were seen to have moderate correlation with ST and PT thickness. Weak correlation was seen between the other anthropometric variables and tendon thickness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of tendon sizes is a reliable method with good inter and intra-rater agreement. Assessment of these anatomical structures with help of MRI would be helpful in preoperative planning and can help in identifying those patients at risk of having smaller tendons. © © 2021.

It plays an active role in maintaining posture balance of the human body in sports, allowing one to bear a larger load and complete various complex technical movements. Objective: To investigate the stability and influence of kinemechanics in knee joint rehabilitation training. Methods: A total of 80 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury who received treatment in Henan Provincial People’s Hospital were selected and divided into control group and observation group according to the random number table method, with 40 cases in each group. Results: Six months after surgery, the peak torque (PT), peak torque to body weight ratio (PT/BWT), total work (TWT), Lysholm score and Tegner score, and knee circumference of the two groups were significantly improved compared with those before surgery (P <0.01). The degree of improvement was greater in the observation group:compared with the control group, the difference was highly statistically significant (P<0.01). Conclusions: Professional exercise rehabilitation has a definite effect on patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. It can significantly improve the muscle strength of quadriceps and hamstring, improve the function of knee joint and promote its recovery.

The TWINFIX™ titanium (Ti) suture anchor with ULTRABRAID™ Suture (Smith and Nephew, London, UK) was designed to secure tendon and ligament reconstructions with increased boney ingrowth at the anchor site with minimal invasive technique. This retrospective analysis looked at 33 patients (41 implants) operated with this device between 2015 and 2019 at a single institution. The average age of patients was 33.18 years (standard deviation [SD], 15.26), with an average body mass index of 24.88 (SD, 3.49). The indications were lateral extra-articular tenodesis during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction, quadriceps or patellar tendon repair and medial collateral ligament repair. After an average follow up of 24.3 + 6.53 months, there was no reports of clinical failure or radiographic evidence of implant failure or loosening. One patient experienced a complication unrelated to the study device, requiring manipulation under anesthesia with resolution of symptoms. This case series supports the safety and performance of this implants for the knee procedures in which its use is indicated. Additional follow-up will be required to determine whether these effects are sustained at medium- and long-term durations. © 2021 by the authors.

The participants whose BMI were between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m were included in group 1 (n = 50, age: 27.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI: 22.3 ± 1.6 kg/m) and those whose BMI > 24.9 kg/m were included in group 2 (n = 41, age: 30.2 ± 6.9 years, BMI: 28.0 ± 2.4 kg/m). INTERVENTIONS: Quadriceps and hamstring strength, functional performance including hop, jump, and balance performance, and IKDC score. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles and the body mass were measured at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. Absolute peak torques and normalized peak torques to body weight for both limbs were recorded. Functional outcomes were evaluated at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: Normalized quadriceps strength improvement was lower in group 2 when compared with group 1 (F(2,178) = 6.23, P = 0.003). Group 2 also demonstrated lower scores in functional performance (P < 0.05). Normalized hamstring and absolute quadriceps and hamstring strength improvement was not affected by higher BMI level (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI levels adversely affect quadriceps strength capacity and performance in patients who have undergone ACLR with HTG. Clinicians should consider BMI levels of patients when assessing and targeting muscle recovery because it could negatively affect the success of the ACLR rehabilitation.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; biomechanics; body equilibrium; body mass; body weight; convalescence; hamstring muscle; hamstring tendon; human; knee; middle aged; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; recreation; rehabilitation; time factor; transplantation; young adult; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Hamstring Muscles; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Knee Joint; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Postural Balance; Prospective Studies; Quadriceps Muscle; Recovery of Function; Recreation; Time Factors; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","1050642X","","","30339632","English","Clin J Sport Med","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095386211"

This study examined muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) as an indirect parameter of motor unit recruitment strategies in the vastus lateralis (VL) and medialis (VM) muscles of soccer players with ACLR. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was acquired from VL and VM in nine soccer players (22.7 ± 2.9 years; BMI: 22.08 ± 1.72 kg·m−2; 7.7 ± 2.2 months post-surgery). Voluntary muscle force and the relative myoelectrical activity from the reconstructed and contralateral sides were recorded during linearly increasing isometric knee extension contractions up to 70% of maximal voluntary isometric force (MVIF). The relation of MFCV and force was examined by linear regression analysis at the individual subject level. The initial (intercept), peak (MFCV<inf>70</inf>), and rate of change (slope) of MFCV related to force were compared between limbs and muscles. The MVIF was lower in the reconstructed side than in the contralateral side (−%20.5; P <.05). MFCV intercept was similar among limbs and muscles (P >.05). MFCV<inf>70</inf> and MFCV slope were lower in the reconstructed side compared to the contralateral for both VL (−28.5% and −10.1%, respectively; P <.001) and VM (−22.6% and −8.1%, respectively; P <.001). The slope of MFCV was lower in the VL than VM, but only in the reconstructed side (−12.4%; P <.001). These results suggest possible impairments in recruitment strategies of high-threshold motor units (HTMUs) as well as deficits in sarcolemmal excitability, fiber diameter, and discharge rate of knee extensor muscles following ACLR. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Material and method: This prospective and descriptive study was conducted over 100 patients, 96 of whom were involved in regular sports activity. They were all taken care of by the rehabilitation unit of CHU Mustapha Pacha of Algiers during 6 years. They all received the same medical rehabilitation program based on the closed kinetic chain, that considered the ligamentization phenomenon (estimated duration in men: 3 years) and mechanical constraints imposed to the knee and the plasty. The evaluation took place at day 0, day 21, month 2, month 3 and month 6 post-surgery, focusing on 5 major elements: pain, intra-articular effusion, joint mobility, muscle strength and amyotrophy. Stability of the knee was evaluated at month 6 post-surgery using IKDC, ARPEGE and Lysholm scores. The rate of activity recovery was evaluated at month 6 post-surgery. Results: Minimal pain: 2.99/10 on EVA scale. Profuse intra-articular effusion at day 21 in 50% of patients; absent at month 6 in 78% patients. Mobility continuously improved. Muscular strength is identical to the contra-lateral side at month 6 post-surgery for 65% patients in regards to the quadriceps muscle and for 70% patients in regards of the hamstring muscle. A 1 cm amyotrophy compared to the contralateral side, with a 10% loss of the muscular mass. Minimal residual laxity without any signs of instability for 9% of patients. Satisfactory results post closed kinetic chain rehabilitation: IKDC score objective A and B (normal to almost normal): 80%; IKDC score subjective: 84.24 points out of 100; Lysholm score: 93.10 point over 100; ARPEGE score: extremely good 94%; return to physical activity for 52.1% subjects. Discussion: Despite the satisfactory clinical and functional results obtained, the level of physical activity recovery remains moderate due to external influences such social, professional and psychological components; anxiety plays a major role as well. The recovery is finally more linked to a minimal dysfunction of the hamstring muscles rather than the quadriceps. That is why the proprioceptive rehabilitation of the Hamstring is a fundamental step in the recovery process. Conclusion: The rehabilitation protocol in closed kinetic chain developed in the eighties shows its importance up to these days. It is now applied in the knee ligamentoplasty rehabilitation program. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Accelerated rehabilitation; ACL; ACL reconstruction; Closed kinetic chain; IKDC; Kenneth Jones; Knee; Physical activity recovery","Algeria; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anxiety; Article; closed kinetic chain exercise; descriptive research; evaluation study; hamstring muscle; human; joint effusion; joint mobility; Kenneth Jones technique; knee arthroscopy; ligament surgery; Lysholm score; major clinical study; muscle atrophy; muscle mass; muscle strength; pain; patellar ligament; physical activity; proprioception; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; sport injury; tendon transplantation; treatment outcome; university hospital","","","","","","","Boileau, Pascal, A plea for accelerated rehabilitation program after ACL repair with bone-tendon-bone graft, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 85, 5, pp. 475-490, (1999); Beynnon, Bruce D., The strain behavior of the anterior cruciate ligament during squatting and active flexion-extension.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Eighteen athletes with ACLR and 18 healthy athletes, matched by sex, age, and activity, were tested at (1) 2 weeks after surgery, (2) the ""quiet knee""time point, defined as full range of motion and minimal effusion, and (3) return to running, defined as achieving a quadriceps index of 80% or greater. We measured (1) corticospinal excitability, using resting motor threshold (RMT) and motor-evoked potential amplitude at a stimulator intensity of 120% of RMT (MEP120) to the vastus medialis, (2) spinal reflexive excitability, calculating the ratio of the maximal Hoffmann reflex to the maximal M-wave to the vastus medialis, and (3) isometric quadriceps strength. RESULTS: The ACLR group had higher RMTs in the nonsurgical limb and higher MEP120 in the surgical limb at all time points. The healthy-athlete group did not have interlimb differences. The RMT was positively associated with quadriceps strength 2 weeks after surgery; MEP120 was associated with quadriceps strength at all time points. CONCLUSION: Compared to healthy athletes, athletes after ACLR had altered corticospinal excitability that did not change from 2 weeks after surgery to the time of return to running. © 2020 Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Corticospinal excitability; Quadriceps","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; athlete; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; excitability; female; Hoffmann reflex; human; knee; male; motor evoked potential; muscle training; prospective study; range of motion; rehabilitation; running; vastus medialis muscle; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; body mass; joint characteristics and functions; muscle strength; pathological reflex; pathophysiology; physiology; pyramidal tract; quadriceps femoris muscle; sport injury; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Athletic Injuries; Body Mass Index; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Prospective Studies; Pyramidal Tracts; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Reflex, Abnormal; Young Adult","","","","","","","Adams, Douglas J., Current concepts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A criterion-based rehabilitation progression, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 42, 7, pp. 601-614, (2012); Baumeister, Jochen, Altered electrocortical brain activity after ACL reconstruction during force control, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 29, 9, pp. 1383-1389, (2011); Baumeister, Jochen, Changed cortical activity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in a joint position paradigm: An EEG study, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 18, 4, pp. 473-484, (2008); Buller, Leonard T., Trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the United States, Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 3, 1, pp. 1-8, (2015); Di Stasi, Stephanie L., Gait patterns differ between ACL-reconstructed athletes who pass return-to-sport criteria and those who fail, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, 6, pp. 1310-1318, (2013); Eitzen, Ingrid, Preoperative quadriceps strength is a significant predictor of knee function two years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 43, 5, pp. 371-376, (2009); Faul, Franz, G*Power 3: A flexible statistical power analysis program for the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences, Behavior Research Methods, 39, 2, pp. 175-191, (2007); Gokeler, Alli, Quadriceps function following ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation: Implications for optimisation of current practices, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 22, 5, pp. 1163-1174, (2014); Grindem, Hege, Simple decision rules can reduce reinjury risk by 84% after ACL reconstruction: The Delaware-Oslo ACL cohort study, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 50, 13, pp. 804-808, (2016); Grooms, Dustin Robert, Neuroplasticity associated with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 47, 3, pp. 180-189, (2017)","R.

We hypothesized that female sex would have significantly worse early functional outcomes and higher retear rates following primary repair of the ACL enhanced with a tissue-engineered scaffold. Methods: Sixty-five patients (28 males and 37 females), age 14-35 with a complete ACL tear underwent primary repair of the ACL enhanced with a tissue-engineered scaffold (bridge-enhanced ACL repair) within 45 days of injury. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) scores, as well as instrumented anteroposterior (AP) laxity through KT-1000 testing and functional outcome measures were obtained at time points up to 2 years postoperatively and compared between males and females using mixed model repeated measures analyses and chi square tests. Results: There was no significant sex difference on the postoperative IKDC Subjective Score at 3, 6, 12, or 24 months or any of the five KOOS scores at 12 and 24 months. Instrumented AP laxity testing demonstrated mean (standard deviation) side-to-side differences that were similar in the two sexes at 2 years; 1.7 (2.7) mm and 1.5 (3.7) mm in females and males, respectively, p = 0.72. At 6 months postoperatively, males had a larger deficit in hamstring strength on the operated leg (14.0% vs. 1.7%; p = 0.03) and a larger deficit in quadriceps strength on the operated leg (11.3% vs. 2.0%; p = 0.004); however, no sex difference was noted at 12 or 24 months. Females demonstrated superior single leg hop testing at 6 and 12 months ([91.3% vs. 78.1%, p = 0.001], [96.9% vs. 87.0%, p = 0.01] respectively). There were no significant sex differences on ipsilateral (males; 14.3% vs. females; 13.9%, p = 1.00) or contralateral (males; 3.6% vs. females; 2.8%, p = 1.00) ACL reinjury rates. Conclusions: Female subjects had better hamstring and quadriceps strength indices at 6 months than males as well as better hop test results at the 6 and 12-month time period. Despite this, there was no significant sex difference on patient-reported outcomes and objective AP laxity testing at time points up to 2 years postoperatively. This is the first study comparing sex specific outcomes following the bridge-enhanced ACL repair technique (BEAR). The results of this study suggest that females have earlier recovery of both muscle strength and functional outcomes compared to their male counterparts. This is an important finding when considering future modifications to postoperative care and rehabilitation in females and males following this tissue-engineered BEAR technique. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","ACL repair; anterior cruciate ligament; BEAR; bridge-enhanced ACL repair; human; sex","Patient rehabilitation; Scaffolds (biology); Statistical tests; Well testing; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament repair; Bridge-enhanced ACL repair; Bridge-enhanced anterior cruciate ligament repair; Human; Ligament repairs; Sex; Repair; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; controlled study; female; hamstring muscle; human; knee; male; muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; randomized controlled trial; sexual characteristics; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Female; Hamstring Muscles; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Strength; Sex Characteristics; Young Adult","","","","","","","Ageberg, Eva, Sex differences in patient-reported outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Data from the swedish knee ligament register, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 7, pp. 1334-1342, (2010); Ahldén, Mattias, Outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with emphasis on sex-related differences, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 22, 5, pp. 618-626, (2012); Aldrian, Silke M., Gender differences following computer-navigated single- and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 22, 9, pp. 2145-2152, (2014); Barber-Westin, Sue D., A rigorous comparison between the sexes of results and complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 4, pp. 514-526, (1997); Ferrari, James D., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in men and women: An outcome analysis comparing gender, Arthroscopy, 17, 6, pp. 588-596, (2001); Lindström, Maria, Functional and muscle morphometric effects of ACL reconstruction.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Biomechanical laboratory. Participants: Skeletally immature ACLR patients. Main outcome measure(s): Muscular strength (quadriceps, hamstrings, hip abductors, and hip extensors), dynamic balance (anterior reach, posteromedial reach, and posterolateral reach), and functional hops tests (single hop, triple hops, cross-over hops, and 6 m timed hops) were examined. The primary outcome variable was the proportion of the study patients whose limb symmetry index (LSI) were ≥90% during return to sport (RTS) tests. Results: A total of 105 skeletally immature ACLR patients who are planning to return to sporting activities (age: 13.4 ± 1.4 years) were enrolled. The proportion of skeletally immature ACLR patients who achieved ≥90% of LSI in all four strength, three balance, and four hop tests were 20.0%, 65.4%, and 27.8%. In those who completed all test battery (72/105), only 4.2% of skeletally immature ACLR patients demonstrated ≥90% of LSI in all RTS tests.

Our aim was to investigate the effects of quadriceps tendon autograft (QTB) vs. semitendinosus-gracilis autograft (StG) on thigh muscle strength and functional capacity, and a patient-reported outcome 1 year after ACL-R, and to compare the results to healthy controls. Methods: ACL-R patients (n = 100) and matched controls (CON, n = 50) were recruited, with patients being randomly assigned to QTB (n = 50) or StG (n = 50) ACL-R. One year after ACL-R, bilateral knee extensor (KE) and flexor (KF) muscle strength (isometric, dynamic, explosive, limb symmetry index [LSI], hamstring:quadriceps ratio [HQ ratio]) were assessed by isokinetic dynamometry, along with functional capacity (single leg hop distance [SHD]) and a patient-reported outcome (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] score). Results: KE muscle strength of the operated leg was lower (9–11%) in QTB vs. StG as was KE LSI, while KF muscle strength was lower (12–17%) in StG vs. QTB as was KF LSI. HQ ratios were lower in StG vs. QTB. Compared with the controls, KE and KF muscle strength were lower in StG (10–22%), while KE muscle strength only was lower in QTB (16–25%). Muscle strength in the StG, QTB, and CON groups was identical in the non-operated leg. While SHD and IKDC did not differ between StG and QTB, SHD in both StG and QTB was lower than CON. The IKDC scores improved significantly 1 year following ACL-R for both graft types. Conclusion: One year after ACL-R, muscle strength is affected by autograft type, with StG leading to impairments of KE and KF muscle strength, while QTB results in more pronounced impairments of KE only. Functional capacity and patient-reported outcome were unaffected by autograft type, with the former showing impairment compared to healthy controls.

Results: Latency of CQA was delayed in ACLR compared to controls at T1 for VL (105 ± 25 vs. 57 ± 9 ms; P < .001), RF (102 ± 23 vs. 56 ± 9 ms; P < .001) and VM (107 ± 24 vs. 66 ± 16 ms; P < .001), at T2 for VL (68 ± 14 vs. 55 ± 10 ms; P < .01) and at T3 for VL (105 ± 22 vs. 58 ± 7 ms; P < .001), RF (102 ± 22 vs. 58 ± 12 ms; P < .001) and VM (106 ± 20 vs. 63 ± 8 ms; P < .001). AQA occurred earlier in ACLR than in controls at T1 for VL (− 82 ± 64 vs. − 14 ± 11 ms; P < .05) and VM (− 105 ± 68 vs. -9 ± 12 ms; P < .05). Conclusion: CQA are delayed following ACLR with hamstring graft and should be addressd by post-surgical rehabilitation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","adult; alpha nerve fiber; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; electromyography; female; flexor muscle; hamstring tendon; human; knee pain; male; muscle strength; muscle tone; physiotherapist; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; rectus femoris muscle; rehabilitation; surgical technique; tendon graft; vastus lateralis muscle; vastus medialis muscle; weight bearing; anterior cruciate ligament injury; case control study; complication; hamstring muscle; joint characteristics and functions; knee; pathophysiology; transplantation; young adult; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Case-Control Studies; Female; Hamstring Muscles; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Young Adult","","","","","","","Sjölander, Per, Spinal and supraspinal effects of activity in ligament afferents, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 12, 3, pp. 167-176, (2002); Konishi, Yu, Mechanism of quadriceps femoris muscle weakness in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 12, 6, pp. 371-375, (2002); Solomonow, Moshe, Sensory - Motor control of ligaments and associated neuromuscular disorders, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 16, 6, pp. 549-567, (2006); Nuccio, Stefano, Neuromechanical response to passive cyclic loading of the ACL in non-professional soccer players: A pilot study, Physical Therapy in Sport, 32, pp. 187-193, (2018); Hopkins, Jon Ty, Arthrogenic muscle inhibition: A limiting factor in joint rehabilitation, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 9, 2, pp. 135-159, (2000); Beutler, Anthony I., Electromyographic analysis of single-leg, closed chain exercises: Implications for rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Athletic Training, 37, 1, pp. 13-18, (2002); Madhavan, Sangeetha, Neuromuscular responses in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament repair, Clinical Neurophysiology, 122, 5, pp. 997-1004, (2011); Rocchi, Jacopo Emanuele, Timing of muscle activation is altered during single-leg landing tasks after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the time of return to sport, Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 30, 6, (2020); Labanca, Luciana, Early compensatory and anticipatory postural adjustments following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, European Journal of Applied Physiology, 115, 7, pp. 1441-1451, (2015); Labanca, Luciana, Postural Adjustments Following ACL Rupture and Reconstruction: A Longitudinal Study, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 39, 7, pp. 549-554, (2018)","L.

HYPOTHESIS: The H/Q ratio is a diagnostic tool for monitoring of the effectiveness of the 6- month PH after ACLR. METHODS: Twenty males 6 months after ACLR (ACLR group) and 20 male controls underwent IT and PT (60°/s and 180°/s) bilateral measurements of H and Q muscles. The IT and PT were normalized to body mass, and expressed as relative IT (RIT) and relative PT (RPT). The RIT and RPT H/Q ratios, and Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) were calculated. RESULTS: In the ACLR group, the RIT for the H and Q, the RIT for the H/Q ratio and most of the RPT, as well as the H/Q ratio, ROM and LSI values of the operated knee, were not significantly different (NSD) than those of the non-operated side (NOS) or the control group. The between-group comparison of the H/Q ratio for RIT and RPT weren't NSD. The isokinetic test at 180 °/s showed lower RPT, H/Q ratio and LSI values for the Q muscle than those of the NOS (p = 0.042, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The H/Q ratio, in combination with the RIT, RPT and LSI, is a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the effectiveness of 6-month PH after ACLR. Restoring the correct H/Q ratio can reduce the risk factor for ACL graft rupture.","","","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","1509409X","","","34846004","English","Acta Bioeng Biomech","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122376157"

Because the mechanical environments for the QT and PT are different, the development of the QT and PT insertions may differ. Purpose: To investigate differences in the development of fibrocartilage layers in the QT and PT insertion sites in rabbits through use of quantitative morphometric evaluations. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: This study included 54 male Japanese White rabbits. Animals were euthanized at ages 1 day and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 weeks (n = 6 for each age). Chondrocyte number, proliferation, apoptosis, sex-determining region Y box 9 (Sox9)–positive rates, safranin O–stained glycosaminoglycan (GAG) areas, tidemark length, insertion width, and patellar length were evaluated and compared with the same parameters at age 24 weeks and between QT and PT insertion sites. Results: Chondrocyte proliferation was low up to age 2 weeks for QT insertion and low up to 1 week for PT insertion. Chondrocyte apoptosis was high at 1 day and Sox9 expression was low up to 1 week for PT insertion. Sox9 expression was higher in QT than in PT insertion at age 12 weeks. The high chondrocyte count continued to age 1 day in PT insertion and up to 6 weeks in QT insertion. The chondrocyte number was higher in QT than in PT insertion at age 2 weeks. The period of thicker GAG lasted from 2 to 8 weeks in PT insertion and from 1 to 12 weeks in QT insertion. GAG thickness in QT insertion was higher than in PT insertion at age 4 and 12 weeks. Conclusion: Development of fibrocartilage layers in QT and PT insertion sites was completed at age 24 weeks in rabbits. However, the period of high chondrocyte count and period of thicker GAG were longer in QT than in PT insertion up to 12 weeks. Clinical Relevance: Development of fibrocartilage layers in QT and PT insertions differed in rabbits. Our results may contribute to the development of appropriate treatments based on age and the development of methods for regeneration of the insertion. © The Author(s) 2020.","development; fibrocartilage layers; glycosaminoglycan; patellar tendon insertion; quadriceps tendon insertion","cycline; transcription factor Sox9; transforming growth factor beta; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; chondrocyte; fibrocartilage; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; Japanese White (rabbit); Leporidae; Lysholm score; male; microscopy; morphometry; nonhuman; patellar ligament; quadriceps femoris muscle; quadriceps tendon; quantitative study; rat; regeneration; tenocyte; TUNEL assay","","","BX-51, Olympus","Olympus","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (18K10846)","","Benjamin, Michael B., Fibrocartilage in tendons and ligaments - An adaptation to compressive load, Journal of Anatomy, 193, 4, pp. 481-494, (1998); Benjamin, Michael B., Where tendons and ligaments meet bone: Attachment sites ('entheses') in relation to exercise and/or mechanical load, Journal of Anatomy, 208, 4, pp. 471-490, (2006); Clark, John M., The interface between bone and tendon at an insertion site: A study of the quadriceps tendon insertion, Journal of Anatomy, 192, 4, pp. 605-616, (1998); Fink, Christian, Minimally Invasive Quadriceps Tendon Single-Bundle, Arthroscopic, Anatomic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Rectangular Bone Tunnels, Arthroscopy Techniques, 7, 10, pp. e1045-e1056, (2018); Grana, William A., An Analysis of Autograft Fixation After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in a Rabbit Model, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 344-351, (1994); Hantes, M.

Our goal was to report the isokinetic, clinical, and functional outcomes over the post–operative year following pedicled hamstring ligamentoplasty. Methods: Twenty-four patients with ACL rupture (mean age 27.4 years) were included prospectively. The technique used a four-stranded HG transplant pedicled to the tibia. The functional result (Lysholm knee score and subjective IKDC score), clinical result (KT-1000, Lachman test, joint amplitudes, objective IKDC score), and isokinetic complication occurrence were analyzed at six months and 12 months follow-up. The functional results, clinical parameters, and complications were analyzed at 30 months follow-up. The comparison of the variables with the various regressions was carried out by a Wilcoxon sign test. Results: Twenty-one patients were reviewed at six, nine, 12, and 30 months. The mean Lysholm knee score was 90/100 at six months, 96/100 at one year, and 95/100 at 30 months. The mean subjective IKDC score was 77/100 and 89/100 at six and 12 months, and 91/100 at 30 months. The mean difference in laxity compared with the healthy knee was 1.4 mm at six months, 1.9 mm at 12 months, and 2 mm at 30 months. The objective IKDC score was A or B for all patients at 12 and 30 months. The average quadriceps strength deficit decreased from 27 to 16% between six and 12 months post–operative (p = 0.0091) and the average flexor deficit from 23 to 12% (p = 0.0084). No complications were identified. Conclusion: The abovementioned technique allows reaching functional, clinical, and isokinetic results comparable with the standard techniques while preserving the mechanical and biological interest of tibial insertion. © 2019, SICOT aisbl.","ACL reconstruction; Hamstrings; Isokinetic; Ligamentoplasty","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; clinical article; female; follow up; hamstring muscle; human; knee meniscus rupture; ligament surgery; Lysholm score; male; muscle strength; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; torque","","","","","","","Baratta, Richard V., Muscular coactivation.

Methods: Between August 2016 and December 2016, forty patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendon were randomly divided into isokinetic group and control group ( n=20). The two groups of patients underwent staged rehabilitation treatment. The isokinetic group replaced the traditional intervention with the corresponding isokinetic strength training from 3 to 6 months after operation, and the traditional rehabilitation intervention was used in the control group. Finally, 12 cases of isokinetic group and 12 cases of control group with complete follow-up were enrolled in study. There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass index, side of injury, the interval between injury and operation, and preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score between the two groups ( P>0.05). The peak torque (PT) of knee extension and flexion and hamstring quadriceps ratio (H/Q) were measured at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and the second-look arthroscopy. The MRI examination was performed at the same time to evaluate graft remodeling. The shape, tension, and degree of vascularization of grafts were observed under arthroscopy. The grafts were harvested and observed by HE staining. Results: The invertal between ACL reconstruction and the second-look arthroscopy was (23.57±3.23) months in isokinetic group and (23.22±3.56) months in control group, showing no significant difference between the two groups ( P>0.05). At the second-look arthroscopy, the IKDC score was 90.45±4.73 in isokinetic group and 89.32±4.54 in control group, showing significant differences when compared with preoperative scores in the two groups ( P<0.05). But there was no significant difference between the two groups ( t=0.868， P=0.404). At 3 months after operation, there was no significant difference in the PT of knee extension and flexion between the two groups ( P>0.05). At 6 months, 12 months, and the second-look arthroscopy, the PT of knee extension and flexion in isokinetic group were higher than those in control group ( P<0.05). The H/Q at 6 months and 12 months were higher in isokinetic group than in control group, and the differences were significant ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in MRI score between the two groups at 3 months, 6 months, and the second-look arthroscopy ( P>0.05). The MRI score at 12 months was significantly higher in isokinetic group than in control group ( P<0.05). At the second-look arthroscopy, there was no significant difference in the arthroscopic score between the two groups ( P>0.05), and the histological score of the isokinetic group was superior to the control group ( P<0.05). Conclusion: On the basis of regular rehabilitation training, using the isokinetic training system to develop a suitable post-surgical isokinetic rehabilitation training program is helpful in early muscle strength recovery, early graft remodeling, and even long-term histological results after ACL reconstruction.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; isokinetic training; rehabilitation; remodeling","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; controlled study; exercise; female; growth, development and aging; human; male; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation; skeletal muscle; thigh; treatment outcome; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Thigh; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","10021892","","","31512448","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072120435"

Design: Cross-sectional; Setting: University community; Participants: Sixty individuals (29 men) with unilateral ACLR in the last 12 months. Main outcome measures: Participants completed bilateral knee extension maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC, Nm/kg) strength assessments. Rates of torque development (Nm*kg -1 *s -1 ) were assessed from contraction initiation to 100 ms (RTD <inf>100</inf> ) and from 100 ms to 200 ms after contraction initiation (RTD <inf>200</inf> ). The effects of sex MVIC strength, RTD, and limb symmetry were assessed using separate ANCOVAs. Results: Women displayed weaker involved limb (Men = 2.72 ± 0.72 Nm*kg -1 , Women = 2.01 ± 0.50 Nm*kg -1 , p < 0.001) and contralateral limb (Men = 3.15 ± 0.52 Nm*kg -1 , Women = 2.66 ± 0.58 Nm*kg -1 , p < 0.001) MVIC, and slower involved limb RTD <inf>100</inf> (Men = 8.36 ± 3.16 Nm*kg -1 *s -1 , Women = 6.50 ± 2.41 Nm*kg -1 *s -1 , p = 0.01) and RTD <inf>200</inf> (Men = 9.49 ± 3.45 Nm*kg -1 *s -1 , Women = 9.49 ± 3.45 Nm*kg -1 *s -1 , p < 0.001) when compared to men. Conclusions: Within the first year after ACLR, women displayed bilateral quadriceps weakness and slower involved limb quadriceps RTD when compared to men.

The size (the amount of tissue) and signal intensity (the quality of tissue) of the healing ligament as visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been shown to be related to its strength in large animal models. Hypothesis: Both modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors could influence the size and signal intensity of the repaired ligament in patients at 6 months after surgery. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: 62 patients (mean age, 19.4 years; range, 14-35 years) underwent MRI of the knee 6 months after ACL repair augmented with an extracellular matrix scaffold. The signal intensity (normalized to cortical bone) and average cross-sectional area of the healing ligament were measured from the MRI stack obtained by use of a gradient echo sequence. Associations between these 2 measures and patient characteristics, which included demographic, clinical, and anatomic features, were determined by use of multivariable regression analysis. Results: A larger cross-sectional area of the repaired ligament at 6 months was associated with male sex, older age, and the performance of a larger notchplasty (P <.05 for all associations). A lower signal intensity at 6 months, indicating greater similarity to normal ligament, was associated with a smaller tibial slope and greater side-to-side difference in quadriceps strength 3 months after surgery. Other factors, including preoperative body mass index, mechanism of injury, tibial stump length, and Marx activity score, were not significantly associated with either MRI parameter at 6 months. Conclusion: Modifiable factors, including surgical notchplasty and slower recovery of quadriceps strength at 3 months, were associated with a larger cross-sectional area and improved signal intensity of the healing ACL after bridge-enhanced ACL repair in this preliminary study. Further studies to determine the optimal size of the notchplasty and the most effective postoperative rehabilitation strategy after ACL repair augmented by a scaffold are justified.

We created subject-specific finite element models for 21 individuals with chronic patellofemoral pain and 16 pain-free control subjects. We extracted three-dimensional geometries from high resolution magnetic resonance images and registered the geometries to magnetic resonance images from an upright weight bearing squat with the knees flexed at 60°. We estimated quadriceps muscle forces corresponding to 60° knee flexion during a stair climb task from motion analysis and electromyography-driven musculoskeletal modelling. We applied the quadriceps muscle forces to our finite element models and evaluated patellofemoral cartilage stress. We quantified cartilage stress using an energy-based effective stress, a scalar quantity representing the local stress intensity in the tissue. We used probabilistic methods to evaluate the effects of variations in quadriceps muscle forces from five trials of the stair climb task for each subject. Patellofemoral effective stress was most sensitive to variations in forces in the two branches of the vastus medialis muscle. Femur cartilage effective stress was most sensitive to variations in vastus medialis forces in 29/37 (78%) subjects, and patella cartilage effective stress was most sensitive to variations in vastus medialis forces in 21/37 (57%) subjects. Femur cartilage effective stress was more sensitive to variations in vastus medialis longus forces in subjects classified as maltrackers compared to normal tracking subjects (p = 0.006). This study provides new evidence of the importance of the vastus medialis muscle in the treatment of patellofemoral pain. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","finite element modelling; Patellofemoral pain; patellofemoral stress; probabilistic modelling; quadriceps force; vastus medialis","Bone; Cartilage; Health; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Muscle; Physiological models; Stairs; Finite element modelling; Patellofemoral; Probabilistic modelling; quadriceps force; Vastus medialis; Finite element method; anatomical variation; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone microarchitecture; bone stress; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; electromyography; female; femoral head cartilage; goniometry; hemodynamics; human; isometric exercise; knee injury; knee ligament; knee pain; Knee Pain Score; kyphosis; male; muscle strength; nerve block; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteoarthritis; pain assessment; patella dislocation; patellofemoral joint; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; questionnaire; range of motion; rectus femoris muscle; tibialis anterior muscle; vastus medialis muscle; adult; articular cartilage; biological model; biomechanics; computer simulation; femur; finite element analysis; joint characteristics and functions; mechanical stress; patella; patellofemoral pain syndrome; pathology; pathophysiology; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cartilage, Articular; Computer Simulation; Female; Femur; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Biological; Patella; Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Stress, Mechanical","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (EB0002524); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, NIBIB, (R01EB005790); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, NIBIB; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA; Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, RR&D, (I01 RX000590-01); Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, RR&D","We thank Christine Draper for help with data collection.

Methods: Twenty-five patients underwent anatomic single-bundle ACL-R using quadriceps tendon autograft. Six months after surgery, each patient underwent high-resolution computed tomography (CT). Tibial tunnel aperture location was evaluated using a grid method. Medial and lateral PTS (°) was measured based on a previously described method. To evaluate tibial tunnel widening, cross-sectional area (CSA) of the tibial tunnel beneath the aperture was measured using CT axial slice. Nominal elliptical area was calculated using the diameter of a dilator during the surgery and the angle between the axial slice and the tunnel axis. Percentage of tunnel widening (%) was determined by dividing the CSA by the nominal area. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to explore the association between medial/lateral PTS and tibial tunnel widening (P < 0.05). Results: Location of tibial tunnel aperture was 29.8 ± 6.3% in anterior–posterior direction, and 45.7 ± 2.1% in medial–lateral direction. Medial and lateral PTS were 3.7° ± 2.5° and 4.9° ± 2.4° respectively. Tibial tunnel widening was 97.2 ± 20.3%. Tibial tunnel widening was correlated with medial PTS (r = 0.558, P = 0.004) and lateral PTS (r = 0.431, P = 0.031). Conclusion: Steeper medial and lateral PTS correlated with greater tibial tunnel widening. The clinical relevance is that surgeons should be aware that PTS may affect tibial tunnel widening after ACL-R. Thus, subjects with steeper PTS may need to be more carefully followed to see if there is greater tibial tunnel widening, which might be important especially in revision ACL-R.

Recently semitendinosus and gracilis tendons graft have been used increasingly. We hypothetise that the Bone-Patella Tendon-Bone graft is a good and economical graft for the Indian population with no adverse effects of anterior knee pain or patellar tendon shortening. We believe that the early squatting and cross-legged sitting causes early and constant stretching of the tendon in our patients. This is responsible for the lesser incidences of adverse effects in the Indian population. Material and Method: In a retrospective study, the hospital database was scrutinized to shortlist patients who had undergone a bone-patella tendon-bone harvest for ACL or PCL reconstruction before 2013. Each patient was evaluated using the Lysholm score and the KOOS Score. VAS was also used, to evaluate for the amount of pain experienced by patients. The analysis of the quadriceps power along with the presence or absence of any extensor lag was made too. The modified Insall Salvati index was also calculated. Results: Forty-seven patients were shortlisted of which 25 patients were followed up with an average follow up of 94.5 months. Although some patients did complain of occasional pain with the average VAS score of 1.45; on analyzing the data it was evident that all our patients had excellent quadriceps power (5/5) with no extensor lag. The mean Lysholm score was 95.55, while the mean KOOS score was 94.17. The mean Insall index of 1.05 showed no significant patella baja in any of our patients. Conclusion: It is ascertained that no significant retro-patellar pain or shortening of the patellar tendon occurs following a bone patella tendon bone harvest. The bone patella bone tendon graft is a suitable graft for ligament reconstruction with good functional outcome, and no significant adverse effect of patella baja or anterior knee pain in the Indian patients.

Early predictive factors for a successful outcome may aid treatment decision making in this population. Purpose: To identify early predictors of a successful 2-year outcome in those who choose nonsurgical treatment of an ACL injury. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: This prospective cohort study consisted of ACL-injured athletes who were consecutively screened for inclusion. A total of 300 patients were included from 2 sites (Oslo, Norway, and Delaware, USA), and the 118 patients who initially chose not to undergo ACL reconstruction were included. All patients participated in pivoting sports before the injury, and none had significant concomitant injuries. A successful 2-year outcome was defined as having 2-year International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores ≥15th normative percentile and not undergoing ACL reconstruction. Multivariable logistic regression models were built using demographic and knee function data (quadriceps muscle strength, 4 single-leg hop tests, IKDC score, and Knee Outcome Survey–Activities of Daily Living Scale [KOS-ADLS] score) collected at baseline or after a 5-week neuromuscular and strength training (NMST) rehabilitation program. Results: After 2 years, 52 of 97 (53.6%) patients had a successful outcome. In the multivariable baseline model, older age, female sex, better performance on the single-leg hop test, and a higher KOS-ADLS score were significantly associated with successful 2-year outcomes. After the 5-week NMST rehabilitation program, older age, female sex, and a higher IKDC score increased the odds of a successful 2-year outcome. The 2 models had comparable predictive accuracy (post-NMST area under the curve [AUC], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.68-0.88]; baseline AUC, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.72-0.89]). Conclusion: Clinicians and patients can be more confident in a nonsurgical treatment choice (active rehabilitation alone) in athletes who are female, are older in age, and have good knee function, as measured by single-leg hop tests and patient-reported outcome measures, early after an ACL injury. Prediction models that include measures of knee function, assessed either before or after rehabilitation, can estimate 2-year prognoses for nonsurgical treatment and thereby assist shared treatment decision making. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.","anterior cruciate ligament; knee function; nonsurgical treatment; prognosis","activity of daily living assessment; adult; age; algorithm; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; athlete; athletic rehabilitation; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; conservative treatment; daily life activity; female; function test; human; International Knee Documentation Committee Score; knee function; Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; muscle strength; neuromuscular facilitation; Norway; patient-reported outcome; prediction; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; rating scale; resistance training; scoring system; screening; sex difference; single leg hop test; United States","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH","*Address correspondence to Hege Grindem, PT, PhD, Norwegian Research Center for Active Rehabilitation, Department of Sports Medicine, Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Pb 4014, Ullevål Stadion, 0806 Oslo, Norway (email: hege.grindem@nih.no) (Twitter: @hegegrindem). †Norwegian Research Center for Active Rehabilitation, Department of Sports Medicine, Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway. ‡Biomechanics and Movement Science Program, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA. §Division of Physical Therapy Education, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA. ||Department of Rehabilitation and Movement Science, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, USA. {Department of Physical Therapy, College of Health Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA. #Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

However, it is limited to static standing position and does not allow time-specific perturbations at different phase of functional activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether administering mechanical perturbation training including compliant surface provides effects similar to manual perturbation training on knee functional measures after an acute ACL-rupture. Sixteen level I/II athletes with ACL-ruptures participated in this preliminary study. Eight patients received mechanical (Mechanical) and eight subjects received manual perturbation training (Manual). All patients completed a functional testing (isometric quadriceps strength, single-legged hop tests) and patient-reported measures (Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADLS), Global Rating Score (GRS), International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 (IKDC 2000) at pre- and post-training. 2 × 2 ANOVA was used for data analysis. No significant group-by-time interactions were found for all measures (p > 0.18). Main effects of time were found for single hop (Pre-testing: 85.14% ± 21.07; Post-testing: 92.49% ± 17.55), triple hop (Pre-testing: 84.64% ± 14.17; Post-testing: 96.64% ± 11.14), KOS-ADLS (Pre-testing: 81.13% ± 11.12; Post-testing: 88.63% ± 12.63), GRS (Pre-testing: 68.63% ± 15.73; Post-testing: 78.81% ± 13.85), and IKDC 2000 (Pre-testing: 66.66% ± 9.85; Post-testing: 76.05% ± 14.62) (p < 0.032). Administering mechanical perturbation training using compliant surfaces induce effects similar to manual perturbation training on knee functional performance after acute ACL-rupture. The clinical significance is both modes of training improve patients' functional-performance and limb-to-limb movement symmetry, and enhancing the patients’ self-reported of knee functional measures after ACL rupture.

Tensiomyography is a recent method to assess muscle strength, and one that also enables evaluation of individual muscles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate motor unit recruitment and investigate the effects on mechanical and contractile characteristics of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles after chronic ACL reconstruction. Methods: This study recruited 20 participants: three males and seven females at 24 months after ACL reconstruction, and three males and seven females with no history of knee injury (control group). All participants underwent tensiomyographic assessment of each thigh muscle, bilaterally, to measure maximal displacement, delay time, contraction time, sustained time, and half-relaxation time. The following muscles were evaluated: vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris. Mean normalized muscle peak torque, mean normalized maximum work done, mean angle to peak torque, and mean time to peak torque based on isokinetic peak torque measurements were calculated in both groups. Results: Maximal displacement of the vastus medialis on the ACL reconstruction side was significantly higher than for the non-ACL reconstruction side and for the control group (p = 0.026). Half-relaxation time for the vastus medialis and biceps femoris was significantly higher for both the ACLR and non-ACLR sides compared with the control group (p = 0.001). There were also significant differences in symmetry in the vastus medialis and biceps femoris when comparing results between the ACL reconstruction group and the control group (p = 0.034, p = 0.043, respectively). Conclusions: The presence of strength and symmetry deficits in the vastus medialis and biceps femoris suggests the need for long-term post-operative training following ACL reconstruction. There are clinical relevant improvements of muscle response and velocity as well as muscle strength in patients with chronic ACLR.

To evaluate angle-specific moments and hamstring (H)/quadriceps (Q) ratios, 46 male subjects with unilateral chronic ACL-rupture performed isokinetic concentric (c), eccentric (e) quadriceps and hamstring muscle tests respectively at 60°/s. Normalized moments and H/Q ratios were calculated for peak moment (PM) and 30°, 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°, 80° knee flexion angles. Furthermore, we introduced single-To-Arithmetic-mean (SAM) and single-To-root-mean-square (SRMS) muscle co-contraction ratios, calculating them for specific angles and different contraction repetitions. Normalized PM and 40° specific concentric quadriceps, concentric hamstring strength in the ACL-deficient knee were reduced significantly (P ≤ 0.05). Concentric angle-specific moments together with Qe/Qc ratios at 40° (d = 0.766 vs. d = 0.654) identify more obvious differences than peak values in ACL ruptured limbs. Furthermore, we found SRMS-QeQc deficits at 40° showed stronger effect than Qe/Qc ratios (d = 0.918 vs. d = 0.766), albeit other ratio differences remained basically the same effect size as the original H/Q ratios. All the newly defined SAM and SRMS indices could decrease variance. Overall, 40° knee moments and SAM/SRMS ratios might be new potential diagnosis indices for ACL rupture detection. © 2017 The Author(s).","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; hamstring muscle; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; muscle contraction; muscle strength; pathophysiology; quadriceps femoris muscle; theoretical model; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Hamstring Muscles; Humans; Knee Injuries; Models, Theoretical; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Strength; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular","","","","","","","Urbach, Dietmar, Bilateral deficit of voluntary quadriceps muscle activation after unilateral ACL tear, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 31, 12, pp. 1691-1696, (1999); Keays, Susan L., The relationship between knee strength and functional stability before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 21, 2, pp. 231-237, (2003); Almosnino, Sivan, Principal component modeling of isokinetic moment curves for discriminating between the injured and healthy knees of unilateral ACL deficient patients, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 24, 1, pp. 134-143, (2014); Piontek, Tomasz, Arthroscopically assisted combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autologous hamstring grafts-isokinetic assessment with control group, PLoS ONE, 8, 12, (2013); Eitzen, Ingrid, Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Deficient Potential Copers and Noncopers Reveal Different Isokinetic Quadriceps Strength Profiles in the Early Stage after Injury, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 3, pp. 586-593, (2010); Tsepis, Elias, Frequency content asymmetry of the isokinetic curve between ACL deficient and healthy knee, Journal of Biomechanics, 37, 6, pp. 857-864, (2004); Tsepis, Elias, Thigh muscle weakness in ACL-deficient knees persists without structured rehabilitation, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 450, pp. 211-218, (2006); Tsepis, Elias, Hamstring weakness as an indicator of poor knee function in ACL-deficient patients, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 1, pp. 22-29, (2004); Wilk, Kevin E., The relationship between subjective knee scores, isokinetic testing, and functional testing in the ACL-reconstructed knee, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 20, 2, pp. 60-73, (1994); Krishnan, Chandramouli, Effect of knee joint angle on side-to-side strength ratios, Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 28, 10, pp. 2981-2987, (2014)","G.

During recovery, a loss of proprioceptive input can have a significant impact. Few studies have evaluated the benefits of rehabilitation of the knee in aquatic environment on functional outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to compare an innovative rehabilitation protocol combining reduced conventional rehabilitation with aquatic rehabilitation, with a conventional rehabilitation, according to the National French Health Authority, in terms of kinetics, development of proprioceptive skills, and functional improvement of the knee. Methods: 67 patients, who were amateur or professional athletes, were randomized into two groups: 35 patients followed the conventional rehabilitation protocol (Gr1) and 32 patients followed the innovative rehabilitation protocol (Gr2). Patients were evaluated before surgery, and at 2 weeks, 1, 2, and 6 months after surgery using posturography, and evaluation of muscular strength, walking performance and proprioception. This study is multicenter, prospective, randomized, and controlled with a group of patients following conventional rehabilitation (level of evidence I). Results: For the same quality of postural control, Gr2 relied more on somesthesia than Gr1 at 6 months. The affected side had an impact on postural control and in particular on the preoperative lateralization, at 2 weeks and at 1 month. Lateralization depended on the affected knee, with less important lateralization in Gr2 preoperatively and at 1 month. The quadriceps muscular strength was higher in Gr2 than in Gr1 at 2 and 6 months and muscle strength of the external hamstring was greater in Gr2 than in Gr1 at 6 months. The isokinetic test showed a greater quadriceps muscular strength in Gr2. Gr2 showed a greater walking distance than Gr1 at one month. Gr2 showed an improvement in the proprioceptive capacities of the operated limb in flexion for the first 2 months. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the innovative rehabilitation program permits faster recovery, allowing for an earlier return to social, sporting, and professional activities. Faster retrieval of knee function following aquatic rehabilitation would prevent both short-term risk of lesions of the contralateral limb due to overcompensation and long-term risk of surgery due to osteoarthritis.

The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that affect quadriceps strength recovery after ACL reconstruction with a hamstring tendon autograft 6 months after surgery. Methods: Isokinetic quadriceps strength at 60°/s was measured preoperatively and 6 months after surgery in 193 athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction with a hamstring tendon autograft. The quadriceps strength index was calculated by normalizing the peak torque of the involved leg with the uninvolved leg. The subjects were divided into two groups according to the quadriceps strength index 6 months after surgery: at least 85 % (n = 84) or less than 85 % (n = 109). Multivariate logistic regression analysis and a receiver operating curve analysis were performed. Results: The preoperative quadriceps strength index [odds ratio (OR) 1.02; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.03], age (OR 0.92; 95 % CI 0.86–0.98), sex (OR 2.45; 95 % CI 1.19–5.18), and knee pain (OR 0.17; 95 % CI 0.04–0.52) were independently associated with quadriceps strength recovery. The cut-off value of the preoperative quadriceps strength index was 70.2 % to obtain at least 85 % quadriceps strength index 6 months after surgery. Conclusion: To achieve sufficient quadriceps strength recovery at the timing of return to sports activities following ACL reconstruction using a hamstring tendon autograft, preoperative quadriceps strength, age, sex, and knee pain should be considered.

Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of SL drop-landing movement symmetry at the time of RTS on knee-related function 2 years later in young athletes after ACLR. The first hypothesis was that young athletes who demonstrated SL drop-landing asymmetries at RTS would demonstrate decreased knee function 2 years later compared with those who demonstrated symmetric SL drop-landing mechanics. The second hypothesis was that SL drop-landing movement symmetry at RTS would be associated with knee functional recovery 2 years later. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: This study included 48 young athletes who had undergone ACLR and were assessed at the time of RTS (77% female; mean [±SD] age at RTS, 17.6 ± 2.6 years) and followed for 2 years after RTS. Three sagittal-plane landing variables of interest were calculated using 3-dimensional motion analysis during an SL drop-landing task at the time of RTS: knee flexion excursion, peak internal knee extension moment, and peak trunk flexion. The limb symmetry index (LSI) was calculated for each landing variable using the following: LSI = (involved/uninvolved) × 100%. The LSI was used to divide the cohort into symmetric (SYM) and asymmetric (ASYM) groups for each landing variable: knee flexion excursion (SYM: LSI ≥ 90% [n = 23]; ASYM: LSI < 85% [n = 18]), peak internal knee extension moment (SYM: LSI ≥ 90% [n = 19]; ASYM: LSI < 85% [n = 22]), and peak trunk flexion (SYM: LSI ≤ 105% [n = 25]; ASYM: LSI > 115% [n = 19]). At 2 years after RTS, knee-related function was evaluated using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form, and performance on SL hop tests. Functional recovery was defined based on literature cutoffs for knee-related functional measures. Differences in 2-year function were compared between the symmetry groups using Mann-Whitney U tests because of nonnormality. Logistic regression was used to determine if landing symmetry at the time of RTS would be associated with 2-year knee functional recovery after RTS. Results: The ASYM knee flexion excursion group demonstrated decreased function at 2 years after RTS compared with the SYM group on the KOOS-Pain (ASYM: 93.0 ± 8.2; SYM: 98.4 ± 3.0; P =.008) and the KOOS-Quality of Life (ASYM: 81.6 ± 16.1; SYM: 94.1 ± 9.7; P =.008). Knee flexion excursion was associated with knee functional recovery on the KOOS-Pain and the KOOS-Quality of Life (P =.033 and P =.012, respectively) at 2 years after RTS, after controlling for the quadriceps strength LSI and graft type. Conclusion: Young athletes after ACLR with asymmetries in knee kinematics at the time of RTS reported decreased self-reported function 2 years later; however, the clinical importance of these differences needs to be further understood. © 2017 The Author(s).","ACL reconstruction; biomechanics; function; knee","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; biomechanics; cohort analysis; convalescence; female; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; knee osteoarthritis; male; movement (physiology); muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; quadriceps femoris muscle; quality of life; return to sport; self report; sport injury; Adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Athletic Injuries; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Knee; Male; Movement; Muscle Strength; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Quadriceps Muscle; Quality of Life; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Return to Sport; Self Report","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (F32-AR055844); National Institutes of Health, NIH; Foundation for Physical Therapy, FPT","yyAddress correspondence to Laura C.

J Strength Cond Res 31(9): 2590-2598, 2017 - A mass-spring-damper (MSD) model may serve as an extension of biomechanical data from 3-dimensional motion analysis and epidemiological data which helps to delineate populations at risk for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate such a model. Thirty-six ACL reconstruction (ACLR) group subjects and 67 controls (CTRL) completed single-leg drop landing and single-leg broad jump tasks. Landing ground reaction force data were collected and analyzed with an MSD model. Medians, interquartile ranges, and limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated and comparisons were made within and between groups. During a single-leg drop landing, the ACLR group had a lower spring LSI than the CTRL group (p = 0.015) and landed with decreased stiffness in the involved limb relative to the uninvolved limb (p = 0.021). The ACLR group also had an increased damping LSI relative to the CTRL group (p = 0.045). The ACLR subjects landed with increased stiffness (p = 0.006) and decreased damping (p = 0.003) in their involved limbs compared to CTRL subjects' nondominant limbs. During a single-leg forward broad jump, the ACLR group had a greater spring LSI value than the CTRL group (p = 0.045). The CTRL group also recorded decreased damping values in their nondominant limbs compared with the involved limbs of the ACLR group (p = 0.046). Athletes who have undergone ACLR display different lower-limb dynamics than healthy controls, according to an MSD model. Quadriceps dominance and leg dominance are components of ACLR athletes' landing strategies and may be identified with an MSD model and addressed during rehabilitation. © 2016 National Strength and Conditioning Association.","anterior cruciate ligament; biomechanics; injury prevention","accident prevention; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; athlete; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; female; ground reaction force; human; male; quadriceps femoris muscle; rehabilitation; rigidity; sport; spring; adolescent; clinical trial; lower limb; physiology; return to sport; risk factor; Adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Athletes; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Return to Sport; Risk Factors","","","","","(R01 AR056259-01, R21 AR065068-01A1); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (U01AR067997); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS; NFL Charities, NFL","The authors would like to thank the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Sports Medicine Biodynamics team who laid the ground work and carried out the large-scale data collection process.

Methods Forty-one individuals [31% male, BMI mean 25 (SD 4) kg/m2, months post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction mean 49 (SD 40)] completed the self-reported function and isometric quadriceps function testing. Rate of torque development was assessed at 0–100 ms (early), 100–200 ms (late) ms, and peak following the onset of contraction. Associations were examined between rate of torque development, strength, and self-reported function. Linear regression was used to determine the unique amount of variance explained by the combination of rate of torque development and strength. Findings Higher rate of torque development 100–200 ms is weakly associated with higher self-reported function in individuals with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (r = 0.274, p = 0.091); however, rate of torque development 100–200 ms does not predict a significant amount of variance in self-reported function after accounting for strength (ΔR2 = 0.003, P = 0.721). Interpretation Quadriceps strength has a greater influence on self-reported function compared to rate of torque development in individuals with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with time from surgery. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ACL; International Knee Documentation Committee; Maximum voluntary contraction; Strength","Muscle; Anterior-Cruciate-Ligament reconstruction; International Knee Documentation Committee; Maximum voluntary contraction; Strength; Torque; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; clinical article; disability; female; human; male; muscle strength; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; torque; young adult; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; biomechanics; knee; knee injury; orthopedic equipment; pathophysiology; self report; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Knee; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Orthopedic Equipment; Quadriceps Muscle; Self Report; Young Adult","","","","","","","Aagaard, Per, Increased rate of force development and neural drive of human skeletal muscle following resistance training, Journal of Applied Physiology, 93, 4, pp. 1318-1326, (2002); Andersen, Lars Louis F., Influence of maximal muscle strength and intrinsic muscle contractile properties on contractile rate of force development, European Journal of Applied Physiology, 96, 1, pp. 46-52, (2006); Andersen, Lars Louis F., Early and late rate of force development: Differential adaptive responses to resistance training?, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 20, 1, (2010); Blackburn, Troy, Quadriceps Function and Gait Kinetics after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 48, 9, pp. 1664-1670, (2016); Faul, Franz, G*Power 3: A flexible statistical power analysis program for the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences, Behavior Research Methods, 39, 2, pp. 175-191, (2007); Folland, Jonathan P., Human capacity for explosive force production: Neural and contractile determinants, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 24, 6, pp. 894-906, (2014); Gokeler, Alli, Quadriceps function following ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation: Implications for optimisation of current practices, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 22, 5, pp. 1163-1174, (2014); Gruber, Markus, Impact of sensorimotor training on the rate of force development and neural activation, European Journal of Applied Physiology, 92, 1-2, pp. 98-105, (2004); Higgins, Laurence De Bree, Reliability and validity of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, Joint Bone Spine, 74, 6, pp. 594-599, (2007); Kadija, Marko V., The effect of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on hamstring and quadriceps muscle function outcome ratios in male athletes, Srpski Arhiv za Celokupno Lekarstvo, 144, 3-4, pp. 151-157, (2016)","H.C.

We hypothesized that a relationship exists between geometry of the knees extensor mechanism and the risk of sustaining a non-contact ACL injury. Geometry of the extensor mechanism was characterized using MRI scans of the knees of 88 subjects that suffered their first non-contact ACL injury and 88 matched control subjects with normal knees that were on the same team. The orientation of the patellar tendon axis was measured relative to the femoral flexion–extension axis to determine the extensor moment arm (EMA), and relative to tibial long axis to measure coronal patellar tendon angle (CPTA) and sagittal patellar tendon angle (SPTA). Associations between these parameters and ACL injury risk were tested with and without adjustment for flexion and internal rotation position of the tibia relative to the femur during MRI data acquisition. After adjustment for internal rotation position of the tibia relative to the femur there were no associations between EMA, CPTA, and SPTA and risk of suffering an ACL injury. However, increased internal rotation position of the tibia relative to the femur was significantly associated with increased risk of ACL injury in female athletes both in univariate analysis (Odds Ratio = 1.16 per degree of internal rotation of the tibia, p = 0.002), as well as after adjustment for EMA, CPTA, and SPTA.: © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Methods: In a retrospective study, the unilateral navicular drop, the ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), internal tibia torsion, knee genu recurvatum, quadriceps angle, hip internal and external rotation ROM and hip anteversion were measured in 53 subjects with complete ACL injury and compared with these accepted standard values. To identify predictor factors for lower extremity alignment and non-contact ACL injuries in male athletes, a multiple logistic regression analysis method was performed. All the subjects were primarily assessed with activity modification and without an ACL reconstruction. Results: The results of this study showed significant predictor correlations between the independent variables, ankle dorsiflexion, hip internal rotation and hip anteversion (p < 0.05). However, the differences in navicular drop, internal tibia torsion, knee hyperextension, Q angle and hip external rotation were non-significant. Conclusion: According to these findings, a decreased ROM in ankle dorsiflexion, hip internal rotation and increased hip anteversion appeared to be statistically significant predictors for developing non-contact ACL ligament injuries in male athletes. Based on the results of this study, significant predictor factors between lower extremity alignment and ACL injuries are clinically relevant as it confirms the existence of increased injury risk with certain patterns of skeletal alignment.

The software generates reports in PDF, Excel and CDA formats. CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) reports are uploaded into an XDS repository, as part of the patient clinical record. To solve the problem of “pincushion” effect in images, a gray tone recognition algorithm and distortion correction algorithm were implemented. The software was used to analyze data of injured and healthy knees of 3 patients. Precision errors introduced during the location of the points were 0.235mm. The Tibiofemoral Contact Point shows an average displacement of 59% in terms of tibial plateau length for healthy knees and 49% for injured knees.

Objectives: To examine the effect of functional knee braces on mean muscle activity when performing lunge exercises. Study design: Pre-/post-test (within-subject research design). Methods: A total of 10 male participants with unilateral isolated anterior cruciate ligament deficiency participated. Electromyographic activities of six muscles around the knee were recorded during lunge exercises, with and without wearing a custom functional knee brace. The lunge cycle movement was subdivided into three phases: eccentric, isometric, and concentric. Results: The quadriceps and hamstrings were no different in the braced and unbraced conditions. When braced, the mean amplitude of the medial gastrocnemius was significantly lower throughout the whole movement (p = 0.01) and during the concentric (p = 0.006) and eccentric (p = 0.028) phases, but not within the isometric phase. The lateral gastrocnemius was found to have lower mean amplitude in the isometric phase (p = 0.044). Conclusion: With its origin on the medial femoral condyle, perhaps reduced medial gastrocnemius activity may better guide knee rotation and assist the joint achieving a healthier kinematic pattern. Clinical relevance Lower medial gastrocnemius activity may facilitate lower medial compartment contact pressure, for which greater loading is known to increase the risk of osteoarthritis in anterior cruciate ligament-deficient (ACLD) knees. However, further research is needed.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Brace; Electromyography","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament brace; anterior cruciate ligament injury; Article; clinical article; concentric exercise; controlled study; device safety; eccentric exerise; electromyography; equipment design; femur condyle; functional status; gastrocnemius muscle; hamstring; human; isometric exercise; joint mobility; knee function; leg exercise; lung exercise; male; muscle contraction; muscle exercise; patient safety; quadriceps femoris muscle; adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; body position; brace; cohort analysis; complication; joint instability; middle aged; muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; skeletal muscle; weight bearing; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Braces; Cohort Studies; Electromyography; Equipment Design; Humans; Joint Instability; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Posture; Weight-Bearing; Young Adult","","","17K48, Otto Bock","Otto Bock","","","Int J Sports Phys Ther, (2013); Smith, Sean D., Functional bracing of ACL injuries: Current state and future directions, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 22, 5, pp. 1131-1141, (2014); Ingersoll, Christopher D., Neuromuscular Consequences of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 27, 3, pp. 383-404, (2008); Lam, Rita Y., Does wearing a functional knee brace affect hamstring reflex time in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency during muscle fatigue?, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 83, 7, pp. 1009-1012, (2002); Williams, Glenn N., Altered quadriceps control in people with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 36, 7, pp. 1089-1097, (2004); Klyne, David M., The effect of anterior cruciate ligament rupture on the timing and amplitude of gastrocnemius muscle activation: A study of alterations in EMG measures and their relationship to knee joint stability, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 22, 3, pp. 446-455, (2012); Reed-Jones, Rebecca J., Kinematics and muscular responses to a ramp descent in the ACL deficient knee, Knee, 15, 2, pp. 117-124, (2008); Branch, Thomas P., Dynamic EMG analysis of anterior cruciate deficient legs with and without bracing during cutting, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 35-41, (1989); Ramsey, Dan K., Electromyographic and biomechanic analysis of anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and functional knee bracing, Clinical Biomechanics, 18, 1, pp. 28-34, (2003); Théoret, Daniel, Study on three-dimensional kinematics and electromyography of ACL deficient knee participants wearing a functional knee brace during running, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 14, 6, pp. 555-563, (2006)","M.

Extension and flexion torques were measured for the injured and healthy limbs at two angular velocities approximately 1.5 months before the surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months after ACLR. Significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in peak knee extension and flexion torques, hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) strength ratios, uninvolved/involved limb peak torque ratios, and the normalized work of these muscles between the four stages of rehabilitation were identified. Significant differences between extension peak torques for the injured and healthy limbs were also detected at all stages. The obtained results showed that 12 months of rehabilitation were insufficient for the involved knee joint to recover its strength to the level of strength of the uninvolved knee joint. The results helped to evaluate the progress of the rehabilitation and to implement necessary modifications optimizing the rehabilitation training program. The results of the study may also be used as referential data for physically active males of similar age. © 2015 Czaplicki et al.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of neuromuscular fatigue on quadriceps strength and activation and sagittal and frontal plane knee biomechanics during dynamic landing following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). BACKGROUND: Impaired quadriceps central activation occurs post-ACLR, likely altering lower extremity biomechanics. Neuromuscular fatigue similarly reduces volitional muscle activation and impairs neuromuscular control. Upon return to full activity post-ACLR, individuals likely concurrently experience quadriceps central activation deficits and neuromuscular fatigue, though the effects of fatigue on muscle strength and activation and biomechanics post-ACLR are unknown. METHODS: Seventeen individuals 7 to 10 months post-ACLR and 16 controls participated. Quadriceps strength and central activation ratio were recorded prefatigue and postfatigue, which was induced via sets of double-leg squats. Knee biomechanics were recorded during a dynamic landing activity prefatigue and postfatigue. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated smaller knee flexion (initial contact, P = .017; peak, P = .004) and abduction (initial contact, P = .005; peak, P = .009) angles postfatigue. The ACLR group had smaller peak knee flexion angles (P<.001) prefatigue and postfatigue than controls. Knee flexion moment was smaller in those post- ACLR than controls prefatigue (P<.001), but not postfatigue (P = .103). Controls had smaller knee flexion moments postfatigue (P = .001). Knee abduction moment was smaller in both groups postfatigue (P = .003). All participants demonstrated significantly lower strength (P<.001) and activation (P = .003) postfatigue. CONCLUSION: Impaired strength, central activation, and biomechanics were present postfatigue in both groups, suggesting that neuromuscular fatigue may increase noncontact ACL injury risk. However, these changes were not exaggerated in those post-ACLR, likely because they already demonstrated a stiff-legged landing strategy prefatigue. © 2015 Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy®.

Methods: Twenty-eight subjects who were 12 weeks post-ACL reconstruction and 28 age- and sex-matched physically active controls participated in this study. Knee extensor torque was assessed bilaterally with an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/s. The variables of interest were peak torque, average rate of torque development, time to peak torque and quadriceps symmetry index. Knee function was assessed with the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF). Results: Peak torque and average rate of torque development were lower on the surgical side compared to the non-surgical side and controls. Quadriceps symmetry index was lower in subjects with ACL reconstruction compared to controls. On the surgical side, average rate of torque development was positively correlated with IKDC-SKF score (r = 0.379) while time to peak torque was negatively correlated with IKDC-SKF score (r = −0.407). Conclusions: At the initiation of advanced ACL reconstruction rehabilitation, the surgical side displayed deficits in peak torque and average rate of torque development. A higher rate of torque development and shorter time to peak torque were associated with better self-reported knee function. The results suggest that the rate of torque development should be addressed during advanced ACL reconstruction rehabilitation and faster knee extensor torque generation may lead to better knee function.

Few studies have assessed the factors affecting patellofemoral joint chondral lesions postoperatively. Hypothesis: The recovery of quadriceps strength after ACLR could be associated with patellofemoral joint cartilage damage. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 88 patients who underwent arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle ACLR with hamstring autografts received second-look arthroscopy at the time of metal staple removal at an average of 24.1 months (range, 12-51 months) postoperatively. All patients underwent standardized isokinetic strength testing for bilateral quadriceps and hamstrings 1 to 2 days before second-look arthroscopy. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Patients in group 1 had a ‰20% deficit on the peak torque measures for quadriceps compared with that of the contralateral knee, whereas those in group 2 had a <20% deficit on peak torque. Cartilage status at the patellofemoral joint and tibiofemoral joint were evaluated by second-look arthroscopy and the Outerbridge classification. Other assessments included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner and Lysholm scores, side-to-side difference on KT-2000 arthrometer, and range of motion. Results: There were 42 patients included in group 1 and 46 patients in group 2. The mean postoperative quadriceps peak torque of the involved knee compared with the contralateral knee was 70% (range, 57%-80%) in group 1 and 95% (range, 81%-116%) in group 2. For all patients, a significant worsening was seen in the patellar and trochlear cartilage (P =.030 and <.001, respectively) but not at the medial or lateral tibiofemoral joint after ACLR. A significant worsening in the status of both patellar and trochlear cartilage was seen after ACLR in group 1 (P =.013 and =.011, respectively) and of trochlear cartilage in group 2 (P =.006). Significantly fewer severe chondral lesions of the patella were found in group 2 than in group 1 (proportion of patients whose cartilage grade worsened: 26% vs 48%, P <.05; difference in cartilage grade: 0.09 vs 0.62, P <.05). There was no significant difference for trochlear chondral worsening between the 2 groups. No significant differences were detected between the 2 groups in terms of hamstring strength; Lysholm, Tegner, and IKDC scores; KT-2000 arthrometer anterior laxity; or range of motion.

It was hypothesized that press-fit fixation using a free autograft bone plug reduces the overall tunnel size in the tibial tunnel. Methods: In a prospective cohort study twelve patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction using an autologous quadriceps tendon graft and adding a free bone block for press-fit fixation (PF) in the tibial tunnel were matched to twelve patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with a hamstring graft and interference screw fixation (IF). The diameters of the bone tunnels were analysed by a multiplanar reconstruction technique (MPR) in a CT scan three months postoperatively. Manual and instrumental laxity (Lachman test, Pivot-shift test, Rolimeter) and functional outcome scores (International Knee Documentation Committee sore, Tegner activity level) were measured after one year follow up. Results: In the PF group the mean bone tunnel diameter at the level of the joint entrance was not significantly enlarged. One and two centimeter distal to the bone tunnel diameter was reduced by 15 % (p = .001). In the IF group the bone tunnel at the level of the joint entrance was enlarged by 14 % (p = .001). One and two centimeter distal to the joint line the IF group showed a widening of the bone tunnel by 21 % (p < .001) One and two centimeter below the joint line the bone tunnel was smaller in the PF group when compared to the IF group (p < .001). No significant difference for laxity test and functional outcome scores could be shown. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that press-fit fixation with free autologous bone plugs in the tibial tunnel results in significantly smaller diameter of the tibial tunnel compared to interference screw fixation. © 2015 Akoto et al.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone graft; bone plug; bone tunnel diameter; clinical article; cohort analysis; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; follow up; hamstring; human; interference screw; International Knee Documentation Committee score; joint laxity; knee function; male; middle aged; musculoskeletal disease assessment; musculoskeletal system parameters; press fit fixation; prospective study; quadriceps tendon; surgical technique; Tegner activity score; tendon graft; tibia; young adult; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament; autotransplantation; bone transplantation; diagnostic imaging; female; internal fixator; postoperative care; procedures; time factor; transplantation; trends; x-ray computed tomography; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone Transplantation; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Internal Fixators; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Care; Prospective Studies; Tibia; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Transplantation, Autologous; Young Adult","","","Gemini GLX 16, Philips Medical Systems; MEGAFIX, Karl Storz","Philips Medical Systems; Karl Storz","","","Hoeher, Jürgen, Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Fact or fiction?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 4, pp. 231-240, (1998); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); Webster, Kate E., Bone tunnel enlargement following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomised comparison of hamstring and patellar tendon grafts with 2-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 9, 2, pp. 86-91, (2001); Faunø, Peter Ziegler, Tunnel widening after hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is influenced by the type of graft fixation used: A prospective randomized study, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 21, 11, pp. 1337-1341, (2005); Dave, Lee Yee Han, Tunnel enlargement 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A radiographic and functional evaluation, European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, 24, 2, pp. 217-223, (2014); Buelow, Jens Ulrich, A prospective evaluation of tunnel enlargement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstrings: Extracortical versus anatomical fixation, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 10, 2, pp. 80-85, (2002); Jansson, Kim A., Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the hamstring autograft and endobutton fixation technique: A clinical, radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging study with 2 years follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 5, pp. 290-295, (1999); Maak, Travis Gardner, Tunnel widening in revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 18, 11, pp. 695-706, (2010); Franceschi, Francesco, A New Harvest Site for Bone Graft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Revision Surgery, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 23, 5, pp. 558-558.e4, (2007); Battaglia, T.

There was no significant difference in age, height, weight, and body mass index between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The proprioception capability (using passive regeneration test at measurement angles of 15, 30, and 60°) and quadriceps mobilization [including maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), central activation ratio (CAR), and activation deficit (AD)] were measured to avaluate the neuromuscular control of the knee; the Lysholm score was used to evaluate knee function. The above indexes were measured to assess the knee neuromuscular control and recovery of joint function in patients of operation group at 3, 6, and 9 months after operation.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, MVC, CAR, and Lysholm scores were significantly decreased, and the AD and passive knee angle difference were significantly increased in operation group (P < 0.05) before operation. With the time after operation, the Lysholm score, CAR, and MVC increased gradually, and the AD and the passive knee angle difference decreased gradually. There was no significant difference in the indexes between 2 groups at 9 months after operation (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic intercondylar fossa angioplasty can relieve ACL pressure, abrasion, and impact, which will recover the ability of neuromuscular control, increase proprioception and quadriceps mobilization capacity, and improve the joint function.","","aged; angioplasty; arthroscopy; human; knee; male; middle aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; pathophysiology; proprioception; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angioplasty; Arthroscopy; Humans; Knee; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Proprioception; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10021892","","","26677614","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979802653"

Given that quadriceps strength may be important for achieving symmetrical joint biomechanics and promoting long-term joint health, determining the magnitude of strength deficits that lead to altered mechanics is critical. Purpose: To determine if the magnitude of quadriceps strength asymmetry alters knee and hip biomechanical symmetry as well as functional performance and self-reported function. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 73 patients were tested at the time they were cleared for return to activity after ACL reconstruction. Quadriceps strength and activation, scores on the International Knee Documentation Committee form, the hop for distance test, and sagittal plane lower extremity biomechanics were recorded while patients completed a single-legged hop. Results: Patients with high and moderate quadriceps strength symmetry had larger central activation ratios as well as greater limb symmetry indices on the hop for distance compared with patients with low quadriceps strength symmetry (P<.05). Similarly, knee flexion angle and external moment symmetry were higher in the patients with high and moderate quadriceps symmetry compared with those with low symmetry (P<.05). Quadriceps strength was found to be associated with sagittal plane knee angle and moment symmetry (P<.05). Conclusion: Patients with low quadriceps strength displayed greater movement asymmetries at the knee in the sagittal plane. Quadriceps strength was related to movement asymmetries and functional performance. Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction needs to focus on maximizing quadriceps strength, which likely will lead to more symmetrical knee biomechanics. © 2014 The Author(s).","biomechanics; isometrics; knee; muscle; return to activity","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; cross-sectional study; female; human; injuries; knee; Knee Injuries; male; movement (physiology); physiology; quadriceps femoris muscle; rehabilitation; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Knee; Knee Joint; Male; Movement; Quadriceps Muscle; Young Adult","","","","","(K08 AR05315201A2); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (K08AR053152); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS","","Adams, Douglas J., Current concepts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A criterion-based rehabilitation progression, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 42, 7, pp. 601-614, (2012); Andersson, Christer A., Knee function after surgical or nonsurgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament: A randomized study with a long-term follow-up period, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 264, pp. 255-263, (1991); Barber, Sue D., Quantitative assessment of functional limitations in normal and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 255, pp. 204-214, (1990); Borotikar, Bhushan S., Combined effects of fatigue and decision making on female lower limb landing postures: Central and peripheral contributions to ACL injury risk, Clinical Biomechanics, 23, 1, pp. 81-92, (2008); Bryant, Adam Leigh, Neuromuscular adaptations and correlates of knee functionality following ACL reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 26, 1, pp. 126-135, (2008); Chaudhari, Ajit M.W., Knee kinematics, cartilage morphology, and osteoarthritis after ACL injury, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 40, 2, pp. 215-222, (2008); Cole, Gerald K., Application of the joint coordinate system to three-dimensional joint attitude and movement representation: A standardization proposal, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 115, 4, pp. 344-349, (1993); Contemp Orthop, (1982); Dempster, Wilfrid Taylor, The anthropometry of the manual work space for the seated subject, American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 17, 4, pp. 289-317, (1959); Zendler, Jessica Deneweth, Tibiofemoral joint kinematics of the anterior cruciate ligament- reconstructed knee during a single-legged hop landing, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 9, pp. 1820-1828, (2010)","R.M.

Materials and Methods: We compared 25 patients diagnosed with chronic unilateral ACL tears and 25 age-matched healthy volunteers. The maximal torque of the quadriceps and hamstring and dynamic balance were measured. Results: Although the isokinetic maximal peak torques were about 50% lower in the quadriceps (57%, p<0.001) and hamstring (56%, p=0.001) muscles in the chronic ACL tear group than in the control group, their HQ ratios were similar (56%±17% vs. 58%±6%, p=0.591). HQ ratio was significantly correlated with anterior-posterior stability index (r=–0.511, p=0.021) and overall stability index (r=–0.476, p=0.034) in control group, but these correlations were not observed in chronic ACL tear group. Conclusions: Thigh muscle strength was about 50% lower in the chronic ACL tear group than in the control group, but the HQ ratio was similar. The dynamic balance of the knee was not influenced by thigh muscle strength but was influenced by HQ ratio in healthy young individuals. However, HQ ratio was not correlated with dynamic knee balance in chronic ACL tear patients. © 2015 KOREAN KNEE SOCIETY.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Chronic tear; Muscle strength; Postural balance","","","","","","","","Hiemstra, Laurie Anne, Hamstring and quadriceps strength balance in normal and hamstring anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed subjects, Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 14, 5, pp. 274-280, (2004); Seo, Seung-suk, Clinical results comparing transtibial technique and outside in technique in single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery and Related Research, 25, 3, pp. 133-140, (2013); de Jong, Suzanne N., Functional Assessment and Muscle Strength Before and After Reconstruction of Chronic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Lesions, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 23, 1, pp. 21-21.e11, (2007); Konishi, Yu, Mechanism of quadriceps femoris muscle weakness in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 12, 6, pp. 371-375, (2002); Papadonikolakis, Anastasios S., Compensatory mechanisms in anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 11, 4, pp. 235-243, (2003); Georgoulis, Anastasios D., ACL injury and reconstruction: Clinical related in vivo biomechanics, Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research, 96, 8, pp. S119-S128, (2010); Costa, Pablo Brando, Effects of stretching on peak torque and the H:Q ratio, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 1, pp. 60-65, (2009); Hewett, Timothy E., Hamstrings to quadriceps peak torque ratios diverge between sexes with increasing isokinetic angular velocity, Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 11, 5, pp. 452-459, (2008); Gauffin, Håkan, Function testing in patients with old rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 11, 1, pp. 73-77, (1990); Lysholm, Marketta, Postural control - A comparison between patients with chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency and healthy individuals, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 8, 6, pp. 432-438, (1998)","D.-H.

GRNB® is a non-irradiating but recently developed tool for which only limited data are available. Hypothesis: The GRNB® offers better reproducibility than TELOS™ for measuring anterior tibial translation without rotation in normal knees. Material and methods: We retrospectively evaluated instrumental laxity measurements in normal knees. Data were available for 60 TELOS™ measurements (9kg load) and 57 GNRB® measurements (89N and 134N loads). For each instrument, we compared the absolute variation in anterior tibial translation between two measurements performed 6 months apart. For each GNRB® measurement, patellar pressure was recorded. Results: No significant differences were found between mean (±SD) variations in translation between the two instruments. A greater than 2.5mm variation between the two measurements was significantly more common with TELOS™ than with GRNB® (P<0.05, Chi2 test). GRNB® translation values did not correlate with patellar pressure. Discussion: The GNRB® device offers greater reproducibility than TELOS™ when used to quantitate anterior tibial translation. The limited sample size may have prevented the detection of a significant difference between mean values. In addition, disadvantages of the TELOS™ include radiation exposure of the patient, operator-dependency of measurements made on the radiographs, and absence of a biofeedback system to limit hamstring contraction. GNRB® does have hamstring contraction biofeedback control but uses another parameter, namely, patellar pressure, for which the optimal value is unknown. Quadriceps and hamstring co-contraction induced by excessive patellar pressure may influence anterior tibial translation. The optimal patellar pressure value needs to be determined.

OBJECTIVES: To determine changes in the neuromuscular activation of the quadriceps and hamstrings following instructions aimed at improving knee flexion during a single-limb landing task in persons who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). BACKGROUND: Clinicians advise patients who have undergone ACLR to increase knee flexion during landing tasks to improve impact aenuation. Another long-standing construct underlying such instruction involves increasing cocontraction of the hamstrings with the quadriceps to limit anterior shear of the tibia on the femur. The current study examined whether cocontraction of the knee musculature changes following instruction to increase knee flexion during landing. METHODS: Thirty-four physically active subjects with unilateral ACLR participated in a 1-time testing session. The kinetics and kinematics of single-leg landing on the surgical limb were analyzed before and after instruction to increase knee flexion and reduce the impact of landing. Vastus lateralis and biceps femoris activities were analyzed using surface electromyography and normalized to a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). Cocontraction indices were integrated over the weight-acceptance phase of landing. RESULTS: Following instruction, peak knee flexion increased (preinstruction mean ±v SD, 56° ±v 11°; postinstruction, 77° ±v 12°; P>.001) and peak vertical ground reaction forces decreased (preinstruction, 3.50 ±v 0.42 body mass; postinstruction, 3.06 ±v 0.44 body mass; P>.001). Cocontraction also decreased following instruction (preinstruction, 30.88% ±v 17.68% MVIC; postinstruction, 23.74% ±v 15.39% MVIC; P>.001). The change in cocontraction was correlated with a decrease in hamstring activity (preinstruction, 23.79% ±v 12.88% MVIC; postinstruction, 19.72% ±v 13.92% MVIC; r = 0.80; P>.001). CONCLUSION: Landing instruction produced both a statistically and clinically significant change in landing mechanics in persons post-ACLR. Conscious improvement of the absorptive power of the surgical limb was marked by decreased hamstring activity and cocontraction during single-limb landing. © 2015 Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy.","Biomechanics; EMG; Knee; Lower extremity; Motor control/learning","adolescent; adult; ankle; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; biomechanics; child; electromyography; female; hip; human; knee; male; muscle strength; physiology; rehabilitation; skeletal muscle; task performance; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Ankle; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Child; Electromyography; Female; Hip; Humans; Knee; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult","","","","","","","Adams, Douglas J., Current concepts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A criterion-based rehabilitation progression, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 42, 7, pp. 601-614, (2012); Alentorn-Geli, Eduard, Prevention of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries in soccer players.

Methods Fifty-one patients undergoing primary double-bundle ACL reconstruction with hamstring grafts were divided into 3 postoperative immobilization protocol groups: 2-day immobilization with the knee in 20° of flexion postoperatively (group A, n = 18); 1-week immobilization (group B, n = 17); and 2-week immobilization (group C, n = 16). Bone tunnel enlargement was determined by computed digital radiographs taken on the first postoperative day and at 24 months in the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. Each tunnel diameter was shown as a percentage of the maximum joint width of the proximal tibia on the AP view or a percentage of the maximum diameter of the patella on the lateral view. To determine the incidence of tunnel enlargement, a percentage diameter change of more than 10% was defined as an enlarged tunnel. The standard clinical evaluation was also performed. This study used nonrandomized procedures. Results In each group there were no significant differences in the incidence and magnitude of anteromedial and posterolateral bone tunnel enlargement on both the AP and lateral views (1-factor analysis of variance). Group C showed significantly less muscle strength in knee extension compared with the contralateral knee (85.3% ± 18.4%) than group A (93.7% ± 13.1%, P =.049) and group B (96.8% ± 12.9%, P =.044). Conclusions This prospective radiographic study showed that femoral bone tunnel enlargement, in both the anteromedial and posterolateral tunnels, may occur after double-bundle ACL reconstruction with hamstring grafts despite different postoperative immobilization periods, with no significant difference in the incidence and magnitude among groups with differing postoperative immobilization periods. In addition, a 2-week immobilization period after surgery showed harmful effects, such as significantly less quadriceps muscle strength.

Hypothesis: There will be no difference in quadriceps muscle strength or International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores in patients with contralateral grafts compared with patients with ipsilateral grafts. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Between 2007 and 2009, a total of 279 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon graft from the contralateral knee met the inclusion criteria of unilateral knee involvement, no arthritic changes preoperatively, and minimum 2-year follow-up objective and subjective evaluations. A control group was obtained of 58 patients who had the same inclusion criteria and were of the same age but who underwent surgery with ipsilateral graft. Patients underwent a goaldirected and sequential postoperative rehabilitation program that first emphasized controlling a hemarthrosis and obtaining full knee range of motion immediately after surgery, followed by increasing leg strength and performing functional activities. The rehabilitation for the contralateral donor site emphasized high-repetition/low-resistance exercises beginning the day after surgery. The IKDC subjective data were compared between surgery groups. Quadriceps muscle strength was evaluated in both knees compared with the preoperative values obtained in the noninvolved knee and between knees at 2 years postoperatively. Results: Quadriceps muscle strength compared with the preoperative normal value (mean 6 SD) was 105% ± 29% in the ipsilateral ACL-reconstructed knee versus 114% ± 28.4% in the contralateral donor knee (P<.01) and 116% ± 25% in the contralateral ACL-reconstructed knee (P = .0339). Mean side-to-side strength (ACL-reconstructed knee/opposite knee) was 98.4% 6 13.6% in the contralateral group versus 92.9% ± 13.0% in the ipsilateral group (P<.01). The mean total IKDC score was 92.4 ± 9.6 for the contralateral donor knee. The mean IKDC total score for the ACL-reconstructed knee was 88.8 ± 12.3 in the contralateral group and 88.9 ± 11.2 in the ipsilateral group (P = .626). Conclusion: After ACL reconstruction with contralateral patellar tendon graft, patients can achieve strength symmetry between legs after surgery without experiencing adverse subjective symptoms after graft harvest. Furthermore, strength return can be superior with a contralateral graft than with an ipsilateral graft. © 2014 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament; contralateral; International Knee Document Committee; patellar tendon donor site; quadriceps strength; reconstruction; rehabilitation; subjective results","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; autotransplantation; female; follow up; human; joint characteristics and functions; kinesiotherapy; knee; male; muscle strength; organ donor; patella ligament; physiology; procedures; quadriceps femoris muscle; rehabilitation; resistance training; retrospective study; transplantation; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Autografts; Exercise Therapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Strength; Patellar Ligament; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Resistance Training; Retrospective Studies; Transplant Donor Site; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","2000 International Knee Documentation Committee Knee Evaluation Form, (2014); N Am J Sports Phys Ther, (2009); Brück, Ekhard, Morbidity after autogenous bone-patellar-bone graft harvest from the opposite knee, Unfallchirurg, 101, 10, pp. 775-778, (1998); Fujita, Norifumi, Comparison of the clinical outcome of double-bundle, anteromedial single-bundle, and posterolateral single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon graft with minimum 2-year follow-up, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 27, 7, pp. 906-913, (2011); Irrgang, James J., Development and validation of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 5, pp. 600-613, (2001); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Comparison of traditional and subcutaneous patellar tendon harvest: A prospective study of donor site-related problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using different graft harvesting techniques, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 3, pp. 328-335, (2000); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Complications following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A 2-5-year follow-up of 604 patients with special emphasis on anterior knee pain, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 1, pp. 2-8, (1999); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Donor-site morbidity and anterior knee problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autografts, Arthroscopy, 17, 9, pp. 971-980, (2001); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Factors affecting donor-site morbidity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 4, pp. 222-228, (1997); Lautamies, Riitta, Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength and knee function 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Comparison between bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring tendon autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 16, 11, pp. 1009-1016, (2008)","","","SAGE Publications Inc. claims@sagepub.com","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","25520302","English","Am.

Only a few studies examining length change patterns and isometry in lateral extra-articular reconstructions have been published. Purpose: To determine a recommended femoral insertion area and graft path for lateral extra-articular reconstructions by measuring length change patterns through a range of knee flexion angles of several combinations of tibial and femoral insertion points on the lateral side of the knee. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were freed of skin and subcutaneous fat. The knee was then mounted in a kinematics rig that loaded the quadriceps muscles and simulated open-chain knee flexion. The length changes of several combinations of tibiofemoral points were measured at knee flexion angles between 0° and 90° by use of linear variable displacement transducers. The changes in length relative to the 0° measurement were recorded. Results: The anterior fiber region of the iliotibial tract displayed a significantly different (P<.001) length change pattern compared with the posterior fiber region. The reconstructions that had a femoral insertion site located proximal to the lateral epicondyle and with the grafts passed deep to the lateral collateral ligament displayed similar length change patterns to each other, with small length increases during knee extension. These reconstructions also showed a significantly lower total strain range compared with the reconstruction located anterior to the epicondyle (P<.001). Conclusion: These findings show that the selection of graft attachment points and graft course affects length change pattern during knee flexion.

The persistence of contact force asymmetries after ACL reconstruction may increase the risk of reinjury and may play an important role in the development of knee osteoarthritis in these patients. Functional performance may also be useful in identifying patients who demonstrate potentially harmful joint contact force asymmetries after ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis: Knee joint contact force asymmetries would be present during gait after ACL reconstruction, and performance on a specific set of validated return-to-sport (RTS) readiness criteria would discriminate between those who demonstrated contact force asymmetries and those who did not. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: A total of 29 patients with ACL ruptures participated in gait analysis and RTS readiness testing 6 months after reconstruction. Muscle and joint contact forces were estimated using an electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal model of the knee. The magnitude of typical limb asymmetry in uninjured controls was used to define limits of meaningful limb asymmetry in patients after ACL reconstruction. The RTS testing included isometric quadriceps strength testing, 4 unilateral hop tests, and 2 self-report questionnaires. Paired t tests were used to assess limb symmetry for peak medial and tibiofemoral contact forces in all patients, and a mixed-design analysis of variance was used to analyze the effect of passing or failing RTS testing on contact force asymmetry. Results: Among all patients, neither statistically significant nor meaningful contact force asymmetries were identified. However, patients who failed RTS testing exhibited meaningful contact force asymmetries, with tibiofemoral contact force being significantly lower for the involved knee. Conversely, patients who passed RTS testing exhibited neither significant nor meaningful contact force asymmetries. Conclusion: Joint contact force asymmetries during gait are present in some patients 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Patients who demonstrated poor functional performance on RTS readiness testing exhibited significant and meaningful contact force asymmetries. Clinical Relevance: When assessing all patients together, variability in the functional status obscured significant and meaningful differences in contact force asymmetry in patients 6 months after ACL reconstruction. These specific RTS readiness criteria appear to differentiate between those who demonstrate joint contact force symmetry after ACL reconstruction and those who do not. © 2013 The Author(s).","ACL; contact force; knee; reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; Athletic Injuries; biomechanics; case control study; electromyography; exercise test; female; gait; human; injuries; knee; male; muscle contraction; muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; quadriceps femoris muscle; questionnaire; rupture; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Electromyography; Exercise Test; Female; Gait; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Strength; Quadriceps Muscle; Rupture; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","","National Center for Research Resources, NCRR, (S10RR022396); National Center for Research Resources, NCRR","","Abebe, Ermias Shawel, The effects of femoral graft placement on in vivo knee kinematics after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Biomechanics, 44, 5, pp. 924-929, (2011); Adams, Douglas J., Current concepts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A criterion-based rehabilitation progression, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 42, 7, pp. 601-614, (2012); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Interactions between kinematics and loading during walking for the normal and ACL deficient knee, Journal of Biomechanics, 38, 2, pp. 293-298, (2005); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Gait mechanics influence healthy cartilage morphology and osteoarthritis of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 91, SUPPL. 1, pp. 95-101, (2009); Buchanan, Thomas S., Neuromusculoskeletal modeling: Estimation of muscle forces and joint moments and movements from measurements of neural command, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, 20, 4, pp. 367-395, (2004); Carter, Dennis R., The mechanobiology of articular cartilage development and degeneration, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 427, SUPPL., pp. S69-S77, (2004); Chaudhari, Ajit M.W., Knee kinematics, cartilage morphology, and osteoarthritis after ACL injury, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 40, 2, pp. 215-222, (2008); DeFrate, Louis E., The 6 degrees of freedom kinematics of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament deficiency: An in vivo imaging analysis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 34, 8, pp. 1240-1246, (2006); Delp, Scott L., An Interactive Graphics-Based Model of the Lower Extremity to Study Orthopaedic Surgical Procedures, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 37, 8, pp. 757-767, (1990); Zendler, Jessica Deneweth, Tibiofemoral joint kinematics of the anterior cruciate ligament- reconstructed knee during a single-legged hop landing, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 9, pp. 1820-1828, (2010)","","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","25318940","English","Am.

Repair of the ACL often requires the use of autografts or allografts, and the RN first assistant (RNFA) often is the team member responsible for preparing the graft. Common grafts used in ACL repair include bone-patellar tendon-bone, hamstring, Achilles tendon, quadriceps tendon, and tibialis anterior tendon. The RNFA must be competent in preparing all of these grafts and in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using each graft, such as the reasons for graft choice, and must ensure that all graft-related supplies and equipment are available and ready for use.

Implementing a post-operative training protocol (ACL-SPORTS Training) to improve patient perceived knee function, may improve short term outcomes after surgery. Identifying pre-training measures that predict normal knee function after training may allow us to determine who may respond to the treatment intervention. The purpose of this study was to identify which pre-training patient reported measures of fear of re-injury and knee function predict normal knee function after ACL-SPORTS Training. Methods: Thirty subjects (13 normal knee function, 17 below normal knee function) with an isolated ACLR, who participated in jumping, cutting and pivoting activities ≥ 50 hrs/yr prior to their injury, were included in this study. Study enrollment required ≥ 80% quadriceps strength, minimal knee joint effusion and ≥ 12 weeks after surgery. Subjects were randomized to two treatment groups. The standard care group received 10 training sessions including quadriceps strengthening exercises, ACL injury prevention exercises and agility drills. The perturbation group received all standard care exercises augmented with perturbation training. Pre-training patient reported measures of fear of re-injury included the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) and the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI). Knee function was measured with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS4), as a mean of the pain, symptoms, sports and recreation, and quality of life subscales. Each subscale (KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-ADLs, KOOS-sport/rec, KOOS-QoL) was also assessed individually. After the training program was completed, self-reported knee function was measured with the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC 2000). Age- and sex-matched normative values were determined based on the top 15th percentile of healthy measures. A binary logistic regression was used to determine which variables significantly predicted normal knee function after training. Results: There was no difference between those who achieved normal knee function and those with below normal knee function for age at the time of surgery (p=0.78), BMI at post-training testing (p=0.71), sex (p=0.13) or time from surgery to post-training testing (p=0.12) and treatment group did not significantly predict normal knee function after training (p=0.96). Higher pre-training ACL-RSI and KOOS4 scores significantly predicted 37.5% and 38.6% of the variance of achieving normal knee function, respectively. Together higher pre-training scores predicted 49.5% of the variance. Of the individual KOOS subscales, higher pre-training KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-ADLs, and KOOS-QoL scores significantly predicted 23.8%, 35.9%, 39.5% and 35.6% of the variance of achieving normal knee function, respectively. Conclusion: Prior to this ACL-SPORTS training protocol higher ACL-RSI, KOOS4, KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-ADLs and KOOS-QoL subscales were able to predict which individuals achieved normal knee function after this treatment protocol. Identifying individuals who do not achieve normal knee function after training may allow us to identify a subgroup of patients that require additional interventions to achieve normal knee function. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; body mass; clinical article; clinical assessment; human; human experiment; knee function; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; logistic regression analysis; priority journal; sport; sport injury; training; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd info@sagepub.co.uk","","","","","","23259671","","","","English","Orthop.

Specifically, we compared the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores between groups and compared to established normative data. Furthermore we evaluated quadriceps muscle strength between surgery groups. Methods: Between 2007 and 2009, 279 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with an autogenous patellar tendon graft from the contralateral knee met the inclusion criteria of unilateral knee involvement, no evidence of arthritic changes preoperatively, and minimum 2 year follow-up objective and subjective evaluations. A control group was obtained of 58 patients who had the same inclusion criteria, were of the same age, but underwent surgery with ipsilateral graft. Patients underwent a goal-directed and sequential postoperative rehabilitation program that emphasized controlling a hemarthrosis, obtaining full knee range of motion as soon as possible after surgery, increasing leg strength, and functional activities to return patients back to sports. The rehabilitation for the contralateral donor site emphasized high repetition/low resistance exercises beginning the day after surgery to reconstitute the patellar tendon size and strength. IKDC subjective data was compared between surgery groups and established normative data. Quadriceps muscle strength was evaluated in both knees compared to the pre-operative values obtained in the non-involved knee; strength between knees at 2 years postoperatively was also evaluated. Results: When comparing quadriceps muscle strength to its pre-operative baseline value, the ipsilateral control group that had statistically significantly less strength in the ACL-reconstructed knee at 105% ± 29% compared with the contralateral group that had 114% ± 28.4% strength in the donor knee (P <.01) and 116% ± 25% strength in the ACL-reconstructed knee (P =.0339). When side-to-side strength was evaluated at 2 years post-operatively, the contralateral group had 98.4% ± 13.6% quadriceps muscle strength compared with 92.9% ± 13.0% in the ipsilateral control group (P <.01). The mean total IKDC scores obtained at the 2-year follow-up was 92.4 ± 9.6 for contralateral donor-knee, 88.8 ± 12.3 in the contralateral ACL-reconstructed knee, and 88.9 ± 11.2 for the control group ACL-reconstructed knee (p=0.960). There was also no statistical significant differences between groups for any of the IKDC sub-scores or total score (All P-values >.136; Table 1). The mean IKDC scores compared with established normative data of noninjured people of the same age and sex showed no large effect size differences between groups. Conclusion: With proper rehabilitation after surgery, use of a contralateral bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft with ACL reconstruction does not cause unresolved donor-site strength loss or subjective symptoms. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; autograft; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comparative study; controlled study; convalescence; donor site; exercise; follow up; human; human tissue; knee function; major clinical study; muscle strength; organ donor; patella ligament; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; range of motion","","","","","","","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd info@sagepub.co.uk","","","","","","23259671","","","","English","Orthop.

This relationship, however, has not been studied with a prospective approach that includes the use of tibiofemoral joint space width difference (JSW-D) measurements to characterize the onset of posttraumatic osteoarthritis before the clinical manifestation of the disease. Purpose: To assess the relationship between thigh muscle strength and JSW-D at presurgery baseline and at 1- and 4-year follow-up after ACLR compared with healthy, noninjured participants of similar sex, age, body mass index, and activity level. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 39 unilateral ACL-injured patients and 32 healthy controls were followed prospectively. During each followup, JSW, isokinetic knee strength, single-legged hop, and clinical- and patient-oriented outcomes were assessed. At final followup, ACL-injured participants who had JSW-D values (considered as the injured minus normal knee) that were less than the 95% confidence interval of controls were considered to be in the ACLR-narrow group, while those with JSW-D values that fell within the confidence intervals were in the ACLR-normal group. Relationships were evaluated between ACLR groups and controls via multilevel regression, as well as Kruskal-Wallis tests for between-group comparisons at 4-year follow-up. Results: At 4-year follow-up, 30 participants (79%) were in the ACLR-normal group and 8 (21%) were in the ACLR-narrow group. At baseline, the extension, flexion, and extension/flexion ratio strength values for both ACLR groups were significantly lower than those of controls (P.05), while the ACLR-narrow group had significantly lower extension strength at 60 and 180 deg/s (P = .04 and .03, respectively), as well as extension/flexion ratio at 60 deg/s (P = .04) in comparison with the ACL-normal group. At 4-year follow-up, 60 deg/s extension strength deficits persisted in the ACLR-narrow group compared with controls and ACLR-normal participants (P = .01 and .04, respectively). Flexion strength at 180 and 300 deg/s was also significantly lower in the ACLR-narrow group compared with ACLR-normal (P = .02 and .04, respectively), as was single-legged hop distance (P = .04). Conclusion: Strength deficits present within months after ACL injury and persist through 4 years after ACLR in participants with significantly narrowed JSW-D, compared with ACLR participants with normal JSW-D and controls.

Thirty ACLR individuals together with 30 healthy individuals participated. With real-time visual feedback of muscle force output and electromyographic electrodes attached to the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, subjects performed an isometric knee extension task where they increased and decreased their muscle force output at 0.128. Hz within a range of 5-30% maximum voluntary capacity. The ACLR group completed the task with more error and increased medial hamstring and vastus medialis activation (. p<. 0.05). Moderate negative correlations (. p<. 0.05) were observed between quadriceps force control and medial (Spearman's rho. =. -0.448, p=. 0.022) and lateral (Spearman's rho. =. -0.401, p=. 0.034) hamstring activation in the ACLR group. Diminished quadriceps sub-maximal force control in ACLR subjects was reflective of medial quadriceps and hamstring dyskinesia (i.e., altered muscle activity patterns and coordination deficits). Within the ACLR group however, augmented hamstring co-activation was associated with better quadriceps force control.

Methods: 14 patients (11 men and three women), mean age 29.9±7.65 years, mean BMI 26.2±2.51 kg/m2 underwent surgical reconstruction of the Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) and Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) in two stages, with a mean interval of 3 months between procedures. With a mean follow-up period of 27.33 months, the isokinetic knee analysis was performed at 60°/s and 180°/s and the Lysholm and Tegner scores were applied. Results: The Lysholm score was 86.8±11.1 points and the Tegner score showed a deficit of 30% compared to pre-injury level. In isokinetic evaluation, the deficit of the operated quadriceps average torque was 17.05% at 60°/s and 12.16% at 180°/s, while the average flexor torque deficit was 3.43% at 60°/s and 5.82% at 180°/s. Although it was observed torque deficit between members, there were no statistical differences regarding the functional balance between hamstrings and quadriceps. Conclusion: Although the results of isokinetic evaluation has shown a functional balance of the knee (flexor-extensor), which may have contributed to the good subjective Lysholm score in the bicruciate two-stage reconstruction, two-stage reconstruction did not restore the pre-injury functional level.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomechanics; Knee; Posterior cruciate ligament","","","","","","","","Jenkins, Paul J., Strength and function recovery after multiple-ligament reconstruction of the knee, Injury, 42, 12, pp. 1426-1429, (2011); Piedade, S.

Evidence suggests that knee injury may precipitate hip and ankle muscle weakness, but few data support this contention after ACL injury and reconstruction. Objective: To determine if hip, knee, and ankle muscle weakness present after ACL injury and after rehabilitation for ACL reconstruction. Design: Case-control study. Setting: University research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Fifteen individuals with ACL injury (8 males, 7 females; age = 20.27 6 5.38 years, height = 1.75 6 0.10 m, mass = 74.39 6 13.26 kg) and 15 control individuals (7 men, 8 women; age=24.73 6 3.37 years, height = 1.75 6 0.09 m, mass = 73.25 6 13.48 kg). Intervention(s): Bilateral concentric strength was assessed at 608/s on an isokinetic dynamometer. The participants with ACL injury were tested preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Control participants were tested on 1 occasion. Main Outcome Measures: Hip-flexor, -extensor, -abductor, and -adductor; knee-extensor and -flexor; and ankle-plantarflexor and -dorsiflexor strength (Nm/kg). Results: The ACL-injured participants demonstrated greater hip-extensor (percentage difference = 19.7, F<inf>1,14</inf> = 7.28, P = .02) and -adductor (percentage difference=16.3, F<inf>1,14</inf>=6.15, P =.03) weakness preoperatively than postoperatively, regardless of limb, and greater postoperative hip-adductor strength (percentage difference = 29.0, F <inf>1,28</inf> = 10.66, P = .003) than control participants. Knee-extensor and -flexor strength were lower in the injured than in the uninjured limb preoperatively and postoperatively (extensor percentage difference = 34.6 preoperatively and 32.6 postoperatively, t<inf>14</inf> range= -4.59 to-4.23, P - .001; flexor percentage difference = 30.6 preoperatively and 10.6 postoperatively, t<inf>14</inf> range = -6.05 to -3.24, P , .05) with greater knee-flexor (percentage difference=25.3, t<inf>14</inf>= -4.65, P , .001) weakness preoperatively in the injured limb of ACLinjured participants. The ACL-injured participants had less injured limb knee-extensor (percentage difference = 32.0, t<inf>28</inf> = -2.84, P = .008) and -flexor (percentage difference = 24.0, t<inf>28</inf> = -2.44, P = .02) strength preoperatively but not postoperatively (extensor: t<inf>28</inf> = -1.79, P = .08; flexor: t <inf>28</inf> = 0.57, P = .58) than control participants. Ankle-plantar-flexor weakness was greater preoperatively than postoperatively in the ACL-injured limb (percentage difference = 31.9, t<inf>14</inf> = -3.20, P = .006). Conclusions: The ACL-injured participants presented with hip-extensor, -adductor, and ankle-plantar-flexor weakness that appeared to be countered during postoperative rehabilitation. Our results confirmed previous findings suggesting greater knee-extensor and -flexor weakness postoperatively in the injured limb than the uninjured limb. The knee extensors and flexors are important dynamic stabilizers; weakness in these muscles could impair knee joint stability. Improving rehabilitation strategies to better target this lingering weakness seems imperative. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.","Isokinetic exercises; Knee; Weakness","adult; ankle; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; biomechanics; case control study; exercise; female; hip; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee; knee injury; male; muscle strength; muscle weakness; physiology; quadriceps femoris muscle; skeletal muscle; young adult; Adult; Ankle; Ankle Joint; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Exercise; Female; Hip; Humans; Knee; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle Weakness; Muscle, Skeletal; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Young Adult","","","","","","","Lohmander, L.

The aim of this paper was to determine the risk factors associated with noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries among male athletes Methods. In a retrospective study, 106 subjects (male athletes) were evaluated. 53 subjects had a complete ACL injury. 53 subjects had no history of ACL injury to either limb and served as controls. Unilateral navicular drop test, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, quadriceps angle, hip internal and external rotation range of motion, hip anteversion, internal tibia torsion, and knee genu recur-vatum were measured. In addition, the athlete's height, weight, age, sport history and sessions were recorded. All the subjects were primarily assessed with activity modification and without anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. All the anterior cruciate ligament injuries occurred during sport participation between 1 and 6 months before the study. Results. The results of this study showed a significant difference between the two groups in terms of the averages of the variables internal tibial torsion, hip internal rotation, ankle dorsi flexion, navicular drop and hip anteversion (P<0.05). However, the difference in Q angle, hip external rotation, and knee hyperextention was not significant (P>0.05). Conclusion. According to the finding of the current research, decreased range of motion in ankle dorsi flexion, hip internal rotation, internal tibial torsion, increased hip anteversion and navicular drop were identified as risk factors to noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries in male athletes.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Athletes; Lower extremity; Wounds and injuries","","","","","","","","Yu, Bing, Mechanisms of non-contact ACL injuries, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, SUPPL. 1, pp. i47-i51, (2007); Flynn, R.

Injuries result in muscular atrophy and impaired muscular activation. To optimize surgical methods and rehabilitation strategies, knowledge of the effects of ACL injuries on muscles size and function is needed. Asymmetry due to limb dominance implies that the effect of ACL-injury might be different in right-sided and left-sided injuries which, should be taken in account when evaluating the effect of an injury. Evaluation of the effects of injuries is usually made with the contralateral leg as control. The aim of this study is to describe the effect of ACL-injuries on thigh muscle size and also to analyze feasibility of using contralateral limb as control. Methods. Sixty-two patients scheduled to undergo ACL reconstruction were examined with computed tomography (CT). Muscle cross sectional area (CSA) was recorded for quadriceps, hamstrings, gracilis and sartorius 15 cm above the knee joint. Comparisons were made between the injured and non-injured side and between individuals separated by gender and side of injury. Comparisons were also made for patients with or without concomitant meniscal tear, for patients differing in time between injury and examinations and for patients with different level of physical activity after the injury. Results: Quadriceps CSA was 5% smaller on the injured side. There was an indication that the muscles of the right thigh were generally bigger than those of the left thigh. The difference between the injured and the non-injured side was larger for right-sided injuries than for left-sided. There was also a greater difference in semimembranosus for women than for men. There were no differences related to meniscal injury, time since injury or physical activity. Conclusion: The use of contralateral leg for evaluating the effect of ACL-injury is often the only available alternative but our study indicates that the difference in CSA between injured and non-injured side does not necessarily reflect the true degree of atrophy, as there are side differences both in muscle size in general and in the effect of an ACL-injury on muscle size. © 2013 Strandberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Atrophy; Computed tomography; Dominance; Gender; Meniscal tear; Muscle size","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; biceps brachii muscle; computer assisted tomography; female; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; knee; knee meniscus rupture; major clinical study; male; muscle; muscle atrophy; physical activity; quadriceps femoris muscle; sartorius muscle; semitendinous muscle; sex difference; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Cartilage, Articular; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Lacerations; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Atrophy; Thigh; Young Adult","","","","","","","Baugher, W.

Indication: Acute and chronic functional instability with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament giving way phenomena, acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament with concomitant meniscus repair. Contraindications: Local infection in the knee joint, local soft tissue damage, lack of cooperation of the patient. Surgical technique: The operation begins with the examination under anesthesia. It follows an arthroscopic examination of the knee and the arthroscopic treatment of accompanying intra-articular lesions (meniscus and cartilage damage). The semitendinosus tendon is harvested via a 3 cm skin incision medial to the tibial tuberosity. A four stranded tendon graft is prepared with a minimum length of 6.5 cm. Alternetive grafts for this technique are the patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, and allografts. The femoral tunnel for the ACL graft is drilled via a deep anteromedial portal under arthroscopic control. For precise placement of the guide wire a specific offset aimer is used. For drilling the knee must be flexed more than 110. Landmarks are the intercondylar line and the cartilage-bone interface. The position of the guide wire is always controlled by the medial portal (medial portal view). The guide wire is overdrilled with a cannulated drill (4.5 mm when a flip tack is used). The drill diameter for the 30 mm long blind tunnel is choosen according to the graft diameter. A gentle tunnel preparation may be achieved with the use of dilators. At the tibia, the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus is used as a landmark in the absence of ACL stump. The guide wire is first overdrilled with a 6 mm drill. Slight adjustments to the tibial tunnel location can be archieved when the guide wire is overdrilled eccentrically with a larger drill. At the femur an extrakortikal fixation technique with a flip button is preferred. At the tibia, a hybrid fixation with absorbable interference screw and button is used. Rehabilitaion: The rehabilitation program is divided into three phases. During the inflammatory phase (1st-2nd week) control of pain and swelling is recommended. The patient is lmobilized with 20 kg partial weigth bearing. During the proliferative phase (3nd-6th week), load and mobility are slowly increased. Goal of this phase is it full extension. Exercises should be performed in a closed chain. During the remodeling phase strength and coordination exercises can be started. Athletes should not return to competitive sports before the 6th to 8th month. Results: In a prospective study, we have examined 21 patients treated with an anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in single-bundle technique, after two years. As graft the semitendinosus was used. The postoperative MRI diagnosis showed that all tunnels were positioned anatomically. KT 1000 measurement showed that the difference of anterior translation decreased from an average of 6.4-1.7 mm. A sliding pivot shift phenomenon was detected in only one patient. The postoperative Lysholmscore was 94.2 points. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arthroscopic surgery; Hybrid fixation; Tendon transfer; Tibia; Treatment outcome","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; clinical article; coordination; drill; exercise; guide wire; human; interference screw; joint pressure; knee arthroscopy; knee meniscus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; quadriceps tendon; rehabilitation; semitendinous muscle; single bundle technique; skin incision; surgical technique; tendon graft; tendon transfer; tibia; tibia tuberosity; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroplasty; Humans; Knee Injuries; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Alentorn-Geli, Eduard, Anteromedial portal versus transtibial drilling techniques in ACL reconstruction: A blinded cross-sectional study at two- to five-year follow-up, International Orthopaedics, 34, 5, pp. 747-754, (2010); Bedi, Asheesh, The ""Footprint"" Anterior Cruciate Ligament Technique: An Anatomic Approach to Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 25, 10, pp. 1128-1138, (2009); Bedi, Asheesh, Transtibial versus anteromedial portal reaming in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: An anatomic and biomechanical evaluation of surgical technique, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 27, 3, pp. 380-e41, (2011); Behrendt, Sven, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Drilling a femoral posterolateral tunnel cannot be accomplished using an over-the-top step-off drill guide, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 18, 9, pp. 1252-1256, (2010); Chhabra, Anikar, Tunnel Expansion After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Autogenous Hamstrings: A Comparison of the Medial Portal and Transtibial Techniques, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 10, pp. 1107-1112, (2006); Dargel, Jens, Femoral bone tunnel placement using the transtibial tunnel or the anteromedial portal in ACL reconstruction: A radiographic evaluation, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 17, 3, pp. 220-227, (2009); Harner, Christopher Dechant, Double bundle or double trouble?, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 20, 10, pp. 1013-1014, (2004); Herbort, Mirco, ACL mismatch reconstructions: Influence of different tunnel placement strategies in single-bundle ACL reconstructions on the knee kinematics, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 18, 11, pp. 1551-1558, (2010); Ho, Jason Yan Dah, Equal Kinematics Between Central Anatomic Single-Bundle and Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructions, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 25, 5, pp. 464-472, (2009); Kopf, Sebastian H., Transtibial ACL reconstruction technique fails to position drill tunnels anatomically in vivo 3D CT study, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 20, 11, pp. 2200-2207, (2012)","W.

Material and methods: A nonrandomized study, which included consecutive patients (n= 31) who underwent ACL reconstruction and were evaluated 2-5 years after ligament reconstruction. The surgical techniques used were the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BTB), quadriceps tendon (QT) and semitendinosus gracilis tendons (ST-G). The clinical evaluation included the Tegner activity Index (TI), Lysholm Index (LI), Index Knee Outcome Survey (KOS) in their sub-divisions "" Total"", "" Activities of Daily Living"" and "" Functionality"" (KOS-T, KOS-ADL, KOS-IF) and Noyes Test (NT). The Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 for Windows was used for the statistical study. Results: Before injury, the TI was 6.74 and after injury 4.35; the LI average was 89.55; the KOS-T was 70.48, KOS-ADL 30.48 and KOS-FI 39.95; and the NT gave a symmetry score of 96.6%. No significant correlations were found between the values of the TI before and after injury, or between the values of the LI and KOS-ADL, and the LI and NT. Conclusion: ACL injury is associated with a high number of meniscal and chondral injuries, with direct impact on the prognosis of these patients' sport activity and a reduction in activity levels. This reduction is not accompanied by a significant functional loss and normal daily activities are unaffected. The motivation of the patient and medical advice are considered key factors in promoting recovery to the pre-lesional level. © 2013.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Function; Physical activity; Surgical techniques","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; daily life activity; human; physical activity; quadriceps tendon; semitendinous muscle","","","","","","","Programa De Reabilitacao Funcional Na Lesao do Ligamento Cruzado Anterior, (1992); Rev Port Med Desport, (1990); Dye, Scott F., Anatomy and biomechanics of the anterior cruciate ligament., Clinics in sports medicine, 7, 4, pp. 715-725, (1988); J Traumatol Sport, (1989); Beynnon, Bruce D., Treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, Part 2, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 11, pp. 1751-1767, (2005); Clin Orthop Relat Res, (1999); Holm, Inger L., No Difference in Knee Function or Prevalence of Osteoarthritis after Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with 4-Strand Hamstring Autograft Versus Patellar Tendon-Bone Autograft, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 3, pp. 448-454, (2010); Neuman, Paul, Patellofemoral osteoarthritis 15 years after anterior cruciate ligament injury - a prospective cohort study, Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, 17, 3, pp. 284-290, (2009); Gillquist, Jan, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and the long term incidence of gonarthrosis, Sports Medicine, 27, 3, pp. 143-156, (1999); Louboutin, Hugues, Osteoarthritis in patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture: A review of risk factors, Knee, 16, 4, pp. 239-244, (2009)","J.

It is partly because previous studies have been unable to relate dynamic knee muscle forces during sports activities such as landing from a jump to the strain in the ACL. We present a combined in vivo/in vitro method to relate the muscle group forces to ACL strain during jump-landing using a newly developed dynamic knee simulator. A dynamic knee simulator system was designed and developed to study the sagittal plane biomechanics of the knee. The simulator is computer controlled and uses six powerful electromechanical actuators to move a cadaver knee in the sagittal plane and to apply dynamic muscle forces at the insertion sites of the quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscle groups and the net moment at the hip joint. In order to demonstrate the capability of the simulator to simulate dynamic sports activities on cadaver knees, motion capture of a live subject landing from a jump on a force plate was performed. The kinematics and ground reaction force data obtained from the motion capture were input into a computer based musculoskeletal lower extremity model. From the model, the force-time profile of each muscle group across the knee during the movement was extracted, along with the motion profiles of the hip and ankle joints. This data was then programmed into the dynamic knee simulator system. Jump-landing was simulated on a cadaver knee successfully. Resulting strain in the ACL was measured using a differential variable reluctance transducer (DVRT). Our results show that the simulator has the capability to accurately simulate the dynamic sagittal plane motion and the dynamic muscle forces during jump-landing. The simulator has high repeatability. The ACL strain values agreed with the values reported in the literature. This combined in vivo/in vitro approach using this dynamic knee simulator system can be effectively used to study the relationship between sagittal plane muscle forces and ACL strain during dynamic activities. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","ACL injury; biomechanical model; knee simulation; muscle forces","ACL injury; Ankle joints; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Bio-mechanical models; Differential variable reluctance transducer; Dynamic knee simulators; Dynamic muscle forces; Force plate; Gastrocnemius muscle; Ground reaction forces; Hip joints; In-vivo; Insertion site; Knee muscles; Knee simulation; Lower extremity models; Motion capture; Motion profile; Muscle force; Non-contact; Sagittal plane; Sports activity; Strain values; Vitro method; Biophysics; Electromechanical devices; Landing; Muscle; Simulators; SportS; Artificial limbs; ankle; anterior cruciate ligament injury; article; biomechanics; differential variable reluctance transducer; dynamic knee simulator; hip; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; muscle strength; simulator; sport; transducer; anterior cruciate ligament; biomimetics; equipment; knee; mechanical stress; movement (physiology); muscle; physiology; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomimetics; Humans; Knee; Movement; Muscles; Stress, Mechanical","","","","","","","Griffin, Letha Yurko Etty, Understanding and preventing noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries: A review of the Hunt Valley II Meeting, January 2005, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 34, 9, pp. 1512-1532, (2006); Hewett, Timothy E., Anterior cruciate ligament injuries in female athletes: Part 1, mechanisms and risk factors, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 34, 2, pp. 299-311, (2006); Hewett, Timothy E., The effect of neuromuscular training on the incidence of knee injury in female athletes.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that there are no significant differences between the semitendinosus tendon alone and the semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft fashioning techniques concerning knee stability and clinical outcome after anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction. Methods: A prospective study was performed on 120 patients who underwent anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction according to the graft fashioning technique. The authors developed the protocol to use hamstring tendon autografts. When the harvested doubled semitendinosus tendon is thicker than 6 mm, each half of the semitendinosus tendon is doubled and used for the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundle grafts (Group I). On the other hand, when the harvested semitendinosus tendon is under 6 mm in thickness, the gracilis tendon is harvested additionally. The distal half of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons are doubled and used for the AM bundle graft, and the remaining proximal half of the semitendinosus tendon is doubled and used for the PL bundle grafts (Group II). Sixty-one patients were included in Group I, and 59 patients in Group II. The two groups were compared concerning knee stability and clinical outcome 2 years after surgery. Results: The postoperative side-to-side anterior laxity averaged 1.3 mm in both groups, showing no statistical difference. There were also no significant differences between the two groups concerning the peak isokinetic torque of the quadriceps and the hamstrings, the Lysholm knee score, and the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation. Conclusion: There were no significant differences between the two graft fashioning techniques after anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction concerning knee stability and postoperative outcome. The present study provided orthopedic surgeons with important information on double-bundle ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendons.

Fatigue has been suggested to impair neuromuscular control strategies. As a result, fatigue may place ACLr patients at increased risk of developing posttraumatic osteoarthritis (OA). Objective: To determine the effects of fatigue on knee-muscle activity post-ACLr. Design: Case control. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: 12 individuals 7-10 mo post-ACLr (7 male, 5 female; age 22.1 ± 4.7 y; 1.8 ± 0.1 m; mass 77.7 ± 11.9 kg) and 13 controls (4 male, 9 female; age 22.9 ± 4.3 y; 1.7 ± 0.1 m; mass 66.9 ± 9.8 kg). Interventions: Fatigue was induced via repetitive sets of double-leg squats (n = 8), which were interspersed with sets of single-leg landings (n = 3), until squats were no longer possible. Main Outcome Measures: 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA was used to detect the main effects of group (ACLr, control) and fatigue state (prefatigue, postfatigue) on quadriceps:hamstring cocontraction index (Q:H CCI). Results: All subjects demonstrated higher Q:H CCI at prefatigue compared with postfatigue (F1,23 = 66.949, P = .001). Q:H CCI did not differ between groups (F1,23 = 0.599, P = .447). Conclusions: The results indicate that regardless of fatigue state, ACLr individuals are capable of restoring muscle-activation patterns similar to those in healthy subjects. As a result, excessive muscle cocontraction, which has been hypothesized as a potential mechanism of posttraumatic OA, may not contribute to joint degeneration after ACLr. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Cocontraction; Hamstring; Knee; Quadriceps","","","","","","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (K08AR053152); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS","","Roos, Ewa M., Joint injury causes knee osteoarthritis in young adults, Current Opinion in Rheumatology, 17, 2, pp. 195-200, (2005); Roos, Harald P., Soccer after anterior cruciate ligament injury - An incompatible combination?

This study examined if antagonist muscle coactivation during maximal dynamic knee extension was elevated in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency compared to age-matched healthy controls. Methods: Electromyography (EMG) and net knee joint moments were recorded during maximal concentric quadriceps and eccentric hamstring contractions, performed in an isokinetic dynamometer (ROM: 90-10°, angular speed: 30°/s). Hamstring antagonist EMG recorded during concentric quadriceps contraction was converted into antagonist moment based on the EMG-moment relationship observed during eccentric agonist contractions. Results: The magnitude of antagonist hamstring EMG was 65.5% higher in ACL deficient subjects compared to healthy controls (p. <. 0.05). Likewise, antagonist hamstring moment expressed in percentage of the measured net extension moment was elevated in ACL deficient subjects (56. ±. 8 to 30. ±. 6%) compared to controls (36. ±. 5 to 19. ±. 2%) at 20-50° of knee flexion (0°=full extension) (p. <. 0.05). Discussion: The results showed a marked increase in hamstring coactivation towards more extended joint positions. Notably, this progressive rise in coactivation was greater in ACL deficient subjects, which may reflect a compensatory strategy to provide stability to the knee joint in the anterior-posterior plane during isolated knee extension. The present study encourages further investigations of hamstring coactivation in ACL deficient subjects. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Antagonist moment; Anterior cruciate ligament; EMG; Hamstring muscle; Neuromuscular activity","adult; aged; antagonist muscle coactivation; anterior cruciate ligament injury; article; clinical article; concentric muscle contraction; controlled study; dynamic knee extension; dynamometry; eccentric muscle contraction; electromyography; hamstring; human; joint function; joint stability; knee function; male; muscle contraction; patient assessment; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; range of motion; voluntary movement; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Electromyography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendons; Young Adult","","","","","","","Arms, Steven W., The biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation and reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 8-18, (1984); Renström, Per Anders F.H., Strain within the anterior cruciate ligament during hamstring and quadriceps activity, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 1, pp. 83-87, (1986); Draganich, Louis F., An in vitro study of anterior cruciate ligament strain induced by quadriceps and hamstrings forces, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 8, 1, pp. 57-63, (1990); More, Robert C., Hamstrings—an anterior cruciate ligament protagonist: An in vitro study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 231-237, (1993); Hirokawa, Shunji, Anterior-posterior and rotational displacement of the tibia elicited by quadriceps contraction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 3, pp. 299-306, (1992); MacWilliams, Bruce A., Hamstrings cocontraction reduces internal rotation, anterior translation, and anterior cruciate ligament load in weight-bearing flexion, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 17, 6, pp. 817-822, (1999); Yanagawa, Takashi, Effect of hamstrings muscle action on stability of the ACL-deficient knee in isokinetic extension exercise, Clinical Biomechanics, 17, 9-10, pp. 705-712, (2002); Caborn, David N.M., The natural history of the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee: A review, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 12, 4, pp. 625-636, (1993); Solomonow, Moshe, The synergistic action of the anterior cruciate ligament and thigh muscles in maintaining joint stability, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 207-213, (1987); Aagaard, Per, Antagonist muscle coactivation during isokinetic knee extension, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 10, 2, pp. 58-67, (2000)","T.

In this study 14 competitive soccer players who had undergone ACL reconstruction with bonepatellar tendonbone autograft and 14 healthy competitive soccer players performed two 10-minute treadmill runs, 1 at moderate intensity and 1 at high intensity. Electromyographic recordings were acquired by use of a telemetric system at the third, fifth, seventh, and tenth minute of the runs from the vastus lateralis and the biceps femoris bilaterally. The dependent variable examined was the peak electromyographic amplitude during the stance phase. Analyses of variance were used to examine significant main effects and interactions. Vastus lateralis electromyographic activity during high-intensity running increased for both the control leg and intact leg (F = 4.48, P < .01), whereas it remained unchanged for the reconstructed leg (P > .05). Biceps femoris electromyographic activity during high-intensity running increased for the reconstructed leg only compared with both the control leg (F = 3.03, P < .05) and intact leg (F = 3.36, P < .03). There is no presence of the quadriceps-dominant strategy in ACL-reconstructed athletes during moderate-intensity exercise. During high-intensity exercise, the intact contralateral leg develops the quadriceps-dominant strategy whereas the reconstructed leg does not. The reconstructed leg instead increases biceps femoris activity, developing a ""hamstring-dominant"" strategy, and this ""asymmetry"" may theoretically be in favor of the reconstructed knee.

Methods. A 5cm quadriceps tendon graft is harvested with an adjacent 2cm bone block. The femoral tunnel is created through a low anteromedial portal in its anatomical position. The tibial tunnel is created with a hollow burr, thus acquiring a free cylindrical bone block. The graft is then passed through the tibial tunnel and the bone block, customized at its tip, is tapped into the femoral tunnel through the anteromedial portal to provide press-fit fixation. The graft is tensioned distally and sutures are tied over a bone bridge at the distal end of the tibial tunnel. From the cylindrical bone block harvested from the tibia the proximal end is customized and gently tapped next to the graft tissue into the tibial tunnel to assure press fitting of the graft in the tibial tunnel. The distal part of the tibial tunnel is filled up with the remaining bone.All patients were observed in a prospective fashion with subjective and objective evaluation after 6weeks, 6 and 12months. Results: Thirty patients have been evaluated at a 12months follow-up. The technique achieved in 96.7% normal or nearly normal results for the objective IKDC. The mean subjective IKDC score was 86.1 ± 15.8. In 96.7% the Tegner score was the same as before injury or decreased one category. A negative or 1+ Lachman test was achieved in all cases. Pivot-shift test was negative or (+) glide in 86.7%. The mean side-to-side difference elevated by instrumental laxity measurement was 1.6 ± 1.1mm. Full ROM has been achieved in 92.3%.

Few reports are available in the literature. Purpose: To report the common tear patterns and results of treatment with tendon repair and cable augmentation. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: All tendon ruptures were repaired to bone with suture anchors and augmented with a Dall-Miles cable, followed by an aggressive rehabilitation protocol. The tear location was recorded. Range of motion, strength, and subjective survey testing were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Thirteen patellar tendon ruptures were found from our database of 5364 ACL reconstructions, for an incidence of 0.24%. Seven ruptures occurred from the patellar origin medially and the tibial attachment laterally in a Z-shaped pattern. Four were completely distal, and 2 were completely proximal ruptures. All patients exhibited early flexion loss, but 11 of 13 patients maintained full, terminal hyperextension throughout treatment. The mean postoperative side-to-side flexion deficit was 33° at 1 month, 6° at 3 months, and 3° at latest follow-up at a mean of 4.8 years after tendon repair (range, 1-16 years). By International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) criteria, 10 patients had normal flexion, and 3 were nearly normal at latest follow-up. Twelve patients had normal extension, and 1 had nearly normal extension at latest follow-up. Mean isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength was 68.7% of the other side at 3 months after repair and 100.0% at latest follow-up, occurring at a mean of 47.5 months (range, 12-120 months). At a mean of 2 years (range, 1-4 years) after repair, the mean modified Noyes subjective score was 89.8 6 9.2. Conclusion: Patellar tendon ruptures are rare after ACL graft harvest. These ruptures usually occur in either a proximal-medial and distal-lateral pattern or an entirely distal pattern, in contrast to the proximal-only tear pattern commonly observed in unharvested patellar tendons. Good objective and subjective results were achieved with repair of postoperative patellar tendon ruptures using suture anchors and Dall-Miles cable augmentation, followed by aggressive, immediate range of motion exercises. © 2012 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; patellar tendon; postoperative complications; repair; rupture; tear pattern","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; orthopedic surgery; patella ligament; pathophysiology; plastic surgery; rupture; suture anchor; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Procedures; Patellar Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rupture; Suture Anchors; Young Adult","","","","","","","Benner, Rodney W., Infections and patellar tendon ruptures after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A comparison of ipsilateral and contralateral patellar tendon autografts, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 39, 3, pp. 519-525, (2011); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

Methods: This study included fifteen patients (range: 20 to 35 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction 18 to 24 months previously and a control group of 15 healthy volunteers with similar characteristics. Cases were evaluated with physical examinations, functional tests, subjective scales (Lysholm, Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score (HSSS), and Tegner activity scale) and isokinetic test. Differences between the reconstruction group and control group were analyzed. Results: Significant differences were found in the activity level of the reconstruction group (p<0.05) and in the clinical findings of the subjects with involved and uninvolved legs (p<0.05). When the reconstructed and control groups were compared according to the limb symmetry index, there were significant differences in single-leg hop test, timed hop test, shuttle run and stair hop test (p<0.05). The study also revealed a significant correlation between the vertical hop and quadriceps strength in the isokinetic test (r=0.56). When the operated knees were compared to the healthy side, mean limb symmetry index was over 92% (with two cases at 88%). When the dominant leg was compared to the non-dominant leg in the control group, the mean limb symmetry index was over 95%. Conclusion: Functional outcomes similar to those of healthy legs can be achieved following ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafting and rehabilitation. The similar functional test results of the operated and healthy subjects prove the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program. © 2012 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Functional rehabilitation; Functional tests; Isokinetic test","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comparative study; convalescence; human; injury; knee; male; pathophysiology; sport injury; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Athletic Injuries; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Recovery of Function; Young Adult","","","","","","","Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Patellar Tendon Graft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery, (2002); Honl, Matthias, Bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: An in vitro comparison of mechanical behavior under failure tensile loading and cyclic submaximal tensile loading, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 4, pp. 549-557, (2002); Högerle, Stephan, ACL reconstruction by patellar tendon.

Methods: Forty-six patients, who underwent anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction, were non-randomly divided into 2 groups. Patients with a combined ligament injury or complete meniscal tear were excluded from this study. In group I, an ECL was used with 23 patients. In group II, an ECL-BTB was used with the remaining 23 patients. In groups I and II, the ECL or ECL-BTB was attached to the femoral ends of the hamstring tendon autografts. In both groups, a polyester tape was connected in series with the tibial ends of the grafts. The patients were examined with standard clinical evaluations at 2 years after surgery. Results: The operation time in group II was significantly shorter than that in group I (P = 0.0459). Concerning the intra- and postoperative complications, there were no serious complications in either group. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of knee laxity measurements, the peak muscle torque of quadriceps and hamstrings, the Lysholm score and the IKDC evaluation. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the usage of the ECL-BTB for graft preparation significantly shortens the total operation time in comparison with the ECL and that there were no significant differences in the 2-year clinical outcome and the intra- and postoperative complications between the 2 graft preparation procedures of the anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction. The ECL-BTB can be an alternative device for the hamstring tendon graft in double-bundle ACL reconstruction.

However, few studies have explored gastrocnemius activity or its relationship to knee stability. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the activation characteristics of medial gastrocnemius (MG) in ACLD subjects and relate any changes to knee joint laxity. Two subject cohorts were assessed: those with unilateral ACLD (n= 15) and uninjured control subjects (n= 11). Surface EMG of the left and right MG were recorded during a controlled single leg hop on each limb. Onset and offset of MG activation relative to take-off, during flight and landing were calculated as well as muscle activity (RMS). Passive antero-posterior knee laxity was measured with a KT1000 arthrometer during a maximal manual displacement test. Medial gastrocnemius activity on the injured side of ACLD participants demonstrated significantly prolonged activation in preparation to hop, minimal muscle inactivity prior to take-off, and increased duration of overall muscle activity when compared to the uninjured side and control subjects (p< 0.05). Significant positive correlations were found between passive knee joint laxity and prolonged activation prior to knee bend. RMS of the muscle signal was not significantly different between limbs. Overall, MG on the ACLD side demonstrated longer activation, with minimal rest during the hop test, which may be an attempt to maintain knee stability. Furthermore, the strong relationship between knee laxity and prolonged muscle activation suggests that individuals with a loss of knee stability are more reliant on active control of the gastrocnemius muscle. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","ACL; Electromyography; Knee joint laxity; Medial gastrocnemius; Proprioception; Stability","adult; amplitude modulation; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthrometer; article; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; electromyogram; female; gastrocnemius muscle; human; joint laxity; joint stability; knee function; knee instability; male; motor performance; muscle contraction; muscle force; muscle function; outcome assessment; priority journal; scoring system; signal detection; stimulus response; task performance; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Locomotion; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Range of Motion, Articular; Rupture","","","","","","","Alkjaer, Tine, Evaluation of the walking pattern in two types of patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency: Copers and non-copers, European Journal of Applied Physiology, 89, 3-4, pp. 301-308, (2003); Barrack, Robert L., Knee joint proprioception revisited, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 3, 1, pp. 18-42, (1994); Barrack, Robert L., Proprioception in the anterior cruciate deficient knee, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 1-6, (1989); Boerboom, Alexander L., Atypical hamstrings electromyographic activity as a compensatory mechanism in anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 9, 4, pp. 211-216, (2001); Bonfim, Thátia Regina, Proprioceptive and behavior impairments in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 84, 8, pp. 1217-1223, (2003); Butler, David L., Ligamentous restraints to anterior-posterior drawer in the human knee.

However, the effect of ACL deficiency on anteroposterior stability of the knee during gait is not well defined. In this study, 10 patients with unilateral acute ACL ruptures and the contralateral side intact performed gait on a treadmill. Flexion angles and anteroposterior translation of the ACL injured and the intact controlateral knees were measured at every 10% of the stance phase of the gait (from heel strike to toe-off) using a combined MRI and dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS). The data indicated that during the stance phase of the gait, the ACL-deficient knees showed higher flexion angles compared to the intact contralateral side, consistent with the assumption of a higher flexion gait strategy. However, the data also revealed that the ACL-deficient knees had higher anterior tibial translation compared to the intact contralateral side during the stance phase of the gait. The higher flexion gait strategy was not shown to correlate to a reduction of the anterior tibial translation in ACL deficient knees. These data may provide indications for conservative treatment or surgical reconstruction of the ACL injured knees in restoration of the knee kinematics during daily walking activities. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Gait; Kinematics","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; conservative treatment; controlled study; dual fluoroscopic imaging system; female; fluoroscopy; gait; human; kinematics; knee; knee function; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; standing; tibialis anterior muscle; treadmill; walking; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Biomechanics; Exercise Test; Female; Fluoroscopy; Gait; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Reference Values; Sampling Studies","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R01AR055612); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS","The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Institute of Health ( R01 AR055612 ) and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital.","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Papageorgiou, Christos D., The biomechanical interdependence between the anterior cruciate ligament replacement graft and the medial meniscus, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 2, pp. 226-231, (2001); Andriacchi, Thomas P., A framework for the in vivo pathomechanics of osteoarthritis at the knee, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 32, 3, pp. 447-457, (2004); Buckwalter, Joseph A., Athletics and osteoarthritis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 6, pp. 873-881, (1997); Gabriel, Mary T., Distribution of in situ forces in the anterior cruciate ligament in response to rotatory loads, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 22, 1, pp. 85-89, (2004); Woo, Savio L.Y., The effectiveness of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with hamstrings and patellar tendon: A cadaveric study comparing anterior tibial and rotational loads, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 84, 6, pp. 907-Adv50, (2002); Li, Guoan, In situ forces of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments in high knee flexion: An in vitro investigation, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 22, 2, pp. 293-297, (2004); Torzilli, Peter A., The Effect of Joint-Compressive Load and Quadriceps Muscle Force on Knee Motion in the Intact and Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Sectioned Knee, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 1, pp. 105-112, (1994); Tashman, Scott, Abnormal rotational knee motion during running after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 32, 4, pp. 975-983, (2004); DeFrate, Louis E., The 6 degrees of freedom kinematics of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament deficiency: An in vivo imaging analysis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 34, 8, pp. 1240-1246, (2006)","G.

Long latency reflexes (LLR) follow a transcortical pathway and appear to be modifiable by task demands, potentially giving them a role in neuromuscular performance. We examined LLRs of the quadriceps and hamstrings in response to unexpected perturbations in individuals with a repaired anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR) during a weight-bearing task. We also investigated the anticipatory and volitional muscle activity that preceded and followed the LLR to quantify possible reflex adaptations associated with surgical repair. Methods: Twelve females with ACLR and 12 healthy female controls performed a single leg squat maneuver, tracking a sinusoidal target. Random perturbations at the start of the flexion phase yielded tracking errors ("" overshoot errors"" ) and triggered compensatory reflex activity. Results: ACLR subjects demonstrated greater overshoot error and knee velocity during unexpected perturbations, increased LLR responses, and reduced absolute anticipatory, short-latency reflex, and voluntary quadriceps activity. Conclusions: ACLR subjects showed impaired response to perturbation and a distinct EMG profile during a dynamic single leg weight-bearing task. Future research will determine the cause of neural adaptations in those with ACLR. Significance: Neuromuscular adaptations may be a viable target for post-ACL injury rehabilitation interventions. © 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.","Neuromuscular control; Reflexes; Single leg squat; Weight bearing","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; clinical article; controlled study; electromyogram; female; hamstring; human; human experiment; latent period; muscle contraction; muscle reflex; neuromuscular function; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; voluntary movement; weight bearing; adolescent; analysis of variance; anterior cruciate ligament; electromyography; innervation; knee; Knee Injuries; motoneuron; physiology; questionnaire; skeletal muscle; surgery; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Motor Neurons; Muscle, Skeletal; Questionnaires; Weight-Bearing","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01-NR-010285-05); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD039445)","This work was supported in part by NIH R01-NR-010285-05 (R.K.S.).","Balogun, Joseph Abiodun, Determinants of single limb stance balance performance., African journal of medicine and medical sciences, 26, 3-4, pp. 153-157, (1997); Bonfim, Thátia Regina, Proprioceptive and behavior impairments in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 84, 8, pp. 1217-1223, (2003); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, A comparison of results in middle-aged and young patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 16, 2, pp. 178-182, (2000); Bulgheroni, Paolo, Gait patterns after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 1, pp. 14-21, (1997); Carp, Jonathan S., Motoneuron plasticity underlying operantly conditioned decrease in primate H-reflex, Journal of Neurophysiology, 72, 1, pp. 431-442, (1994); Introduction to Surface Electromyography, (1998); Di Fabio, Richard P., Effect of knee joint laxity on long-loop postural reflexes: evidence for a human capsular-hamstring reflex, Experimental Brain Research, 90, 1, pp. 189-200, (1992); Elmqvist, Lars Gunnar, Knee extensor muscle function before and after reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament tear, Scandinavian Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, 21, 3, pp. 131-139, (1989); Ferber, Reed, Gait perturbation response in chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and repair, Clinical Biomechanics, 18, 2, pp. 132-141, (2003); Fremerey, Reinhard W., Proprioception after rehabilitation and reconstruction in knees with defiency of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 82, 6, pp. 801-806, (2000)","R.K.

Methods: A total of 112 patients with primary rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament were included in a prospective case control study and 106 patients could be evaluated postoperatively after a mean of 12.4 months (range 12-14 months). Results: The patients showed good to excellent results according to the Lysholm score in 81% and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score in 86% of cases. Furthermore the anterior-posterior translation was less than 3 mm in 83% of the patients by testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer. Neither tunnel widening nor an increase of radiological joint degeneration was recorded by radiological examination. Conclusion: Reconstruction of the ACL with an autologous quadriceps tendon and an implant-free technique yielded good results compared to established operative methods in the short-term and should be consistently followed-up for long-term confirmation. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Implant-free; Press-fit; Quadriceps tendon; Reconstruction","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; pathophysiology; patient satisfaction; physiology; postoperative care; postoperative complication; prospective study; prostheses and orthoses; sport injury; suture anchor; tendon transfer; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Prostheses and Implants; Range of Motion, Articular; Suture Anchors; Tendon Transfer; Young Adult","","","","","","","Bernard, Manfred, Femoral insertion of the ACL.

In1987 an implant-free press-fit fixation technique of a BTB graft from the medial side of the patellar tendon (via mini-arthrotomy) was introduced and first published during the 4th ESKA Conference 1990 in Stockholm. Special emphasis is given to the anatomical orientation of the BTB graft. During the inside-out femoral press-fit fixation the bone-ligament margin of the graft is placed directly into the femoral insertion line of the natural ACL adapting its double-bundle structure. The graft is fixed by press-fit within the tibial metaphysis and its ligamentous part is secured in the metaphysis by harvested cancellous bone blocks driven into the joint line from the outside. The postoperative regime includes weight-bearing as tolerated and free motion. Out of 159 patients 95 could be seen for follow-up after an average of 10.7 years. The final IKDC knee score revealed 22.1% in group A (very good) and 62.1% in group B (good). The Tegner activity level was 6.8 preinjury and 6.0 postoperatively. The average KT 1,000 side-to-side difference was 1.8 mm. Subjectively no patient complained of instability and 99% of the patients could kneel on hard ground with minimal or no complaints. ACL revision surgery due to graft failure was not necessary in any of the patients. Advantages of the described procedure are a narrow anatomical orientation including the double bundle structure of the ACL, rapid graft incorporation by bone-to-bone healing, lack of bone resorption at the graft-host interface, decreased donor site morbidity, cost-effectiveness and ease of possible revision surgery. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Double bundle; Hardware-free; Long-term results; Patellar tendon; Press-fit fixation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; patella ligament; pressure; prostheses and orthoses; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Patellar Ligament; Pressure; Prostheses and Implants; Tendons; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Ahldén, Mattias, Knee laxity measurements after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, using either bone-patellar-tendon-bone or hamstring tendon autografts, with special emphasis on comparison over time, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 17, 9, pp. 1117-1124, (2009); Kniegelenk Und Kreuzbander, (1990); Deutscher Kongress Fur Orthopadie Und Unfallchirurgie, (2009); Bernard, Manfred, Intraoperative and postoperative insertion control of ACL grafts.

Demonstrating the long-term success of such a cost-effective program would be beneficial to guide future rehabilitation practice. Purpose: To determine whether there were any differences in long-term outcome between recreational athletes who performed a physical therapy-supervised rehabilitation program and those who performed a primarily home-based rehabilitation program in the first 3 months after ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Randomized clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients were randomized before ACL reconstruction surgery to either the physical therapy-supervised (17 physical therapy sessions) or home-based (4 physical therapy sessions) program. Eighty-eight of the original 129 patients returned 2 to 4 years after surgery to assess their long-term clinical outcomes. Primary outcome was the ACL quality of life questionnaire (ACL QOL). Secondary outcomes were bilateral difference in knee extension and flexion range of motion, sagittal plane knee laxity, relative quadriceps and hamstring strength, and objective International Knee Documentation Committee score. Unpaired t tests and a chisquare test were used for the comparisons. Results: The home-based group had a significantly higher mean ACL QOL score (80.0 ± 16.2) than the physical therapy-supervised group (69.9 ± 22.0) a mean of 38 months after surgery (P =.02,95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7, 18.4). The mean change in ACL QOL score from before surgery to follow-up was not significantly different between the groups (physical therapy = 40.0, home = 45.8, P =.26, 95% CI: -15.8, 4.4). There were no significant differences in the secondary outcome measures. Conclusion: This long-term study upholds the short-term findings of the original randomized clinical trial by demonstrating that patients who participate in a predominantly home-based rehabilitation program in the first 3 months after ACL reconstruction have similar 2- to 4-year outcomes compared with those patients who participate in a more clinically supervised program. © 2010 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament; cost-effectiveness; home-based rehabilitation; quality of life","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; knee injury; male; muscle strength; orthopedic surgery; physiology; physiotherapy; plastic surgery; quadriceps femoris muscle; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle Strength; Orthopedic Procedures; Physical Therapy Modalities; Quadriceps Muscle; Quality of Life; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Arneja, Shalinder S., Augmentation of Femoral Fixation in Hamstring Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with a Bioabsorbable Bead: A Prospective Single-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 32, 1, pp. 159-163, (2004); Beard, David John, Home or supervised rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomized controlled trial, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 27, 2, pp. 134-143, (1998); Beaton, Dorcas E., Many faces of the minimal clinically important difference (MICD): A literature review and directions for future research, Current Opinion in Rheumatology, 14, 2, pp. 109-114, (2002); Beynnon, Bruce D., Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective, randomized, double-blind comparison of programs administered over 2 different time intervals, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 3, pp. 347-359, (2005); Birmingham, Trevor B., A randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of functional knee brace and neoprene sleeve use after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 36, 4, pp. 648-655, (2008); Birmingham, Trevor B., Effect of a functional knee brace on knee flexion and extension strength after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 83, 10, pp. 1472-1475, (2002); Boone, D.

The aim of this study is to report the results of a consecutive series of patients who underwent the same surgical technique for isolated PCL reconstruction and were submitted to the same specific rehabilitation protocol. A non-aggressive rehabilitation protocol which protects the graft from excess mechanical stress produces satisfying and reproducible clinical and laxity results in the knee. Materials and methods: Our series included 17 patients who underwent single bundle arthroscopic reconstruction of the PCL with an autologous quadriceps tendon graft and who followed the same non-aggressive rehabilitation protocol. All patients were followed up for an average of 30 months (range 12-60 months). The preoperative evaluation and the last follow-up included objective and subjective IKDC scores as well as the Tegner & Lysholm knee scales. The side to side laxity was measured radiologocially with the Telos stress testing device. A statistical analysis was performed to compare preoperative and postoperative results. Results: Preoperatively, no patients were classified as A or B on the IKDC objective score. At last follow-up visit, 88.2% of patients were classified as A or B. Average side to side anteroposterior laxity was 11.9 mm (range 8-18) in the preoperative evaluation and 3.8 mm (range 1-7) in the final follow-up (p = 0.01) The average subjective IKDC score was 37.7 before surgery and 74.7 at last follow-up (p < 0.01). The Tegner & Lysholm scores were significantly improved by surgery. Discussion: Although the results are still less successful than ACL reconstruction, successful PCL reconstruction results were obtained with a standardized single bundle reconstruction technique and an adapted specific postoperative rehabilitation protocol. A non-aggressive rehabilitation protocol can limit postoperative mechanical stress on the graft. Type of study: Retrospective Level IV. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methods: From August 2004 to July 2006, 159 patients with ACL rupture underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with LARS artificial ligament at 4 orthopaedic sports medicine centers in China. They were retrospectively followed up for 50 ± 6 months (range, 36 to 62 months). Outcome assessment included physical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer testing (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), magnetic resonance imaging, radiography, Lysholm score, Tegner score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and subjective satisfaction rate. Quadriceps and hamstring isokinetic strength was evaluated in 68 patients. Results: The side-to-side difference in anterior translation (injured side - uninjured side) measured by KT-1000 arthrometer was 1.5 ± 1.6 mm (range, -1 to 7 mm) postoperatively, and knee stability was significantly improved compared with preoperative data (P < .0001). Quadriceps and hamstring isokinetic peak torque of the injured limb expressed as a percentage of the contralateral limb was 93.6 ± 10.7 and 95.8 ± 12.0, respectively. The Lysholm score improved from 65.1 ± 12.3 points (range, 30 to 95 points) preoperatively to 94.5 ± 7.0 points (range, 65 to 100 points) postoperatively (P < .0001). The Tegner score improved from 3.1 ± 1.6 (range, 0 to 6) preoperatively to 6.1 ± 1.5 (range, 1 to 9) postoperatively (P < .0001). According to the International Knee Documentation Committee score, 94% of patients were graded A or B at last follow-up. Ninety-three percent of patients were very satisfied or satisfied with their outcome. LARS artificial ligament rupture occurred in 3 patients; knee synovitis developed in 1 of these patients. Conclusions: ACL reconstruction with LARS artificial ligament used in patients with the ACL stump preserved in the acute and chronic phases has a very good outcome at mean of 50 months' follow-up. The overall complication rate for ACL reconstruction with LARS artificial ligament is 5.7%, and knee synovitis developed in only 1 case.

Purpose and Hypotheses: The purpose of this study was to investigate quadriceps muscle performance during the whole isokinetic curve in subjects with ACL deficiency classified as potential copers or noncopers and to investigate whether these curve profiles were associated with single-legged hop performance. We hypothesized that quadriceps muscle torque at other knee flexion angles than peak torque would give more information about quadriceps muscle strength deficits. Furthermore, we hypothesized that there would be significant torque differences between potential copers and noncopers and a significant relationship between angle-specific torque values and single-legged hop performance. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Seventy-six individuals with a complete unilateral ACL rupture within the last 3 months were included. The subjects were classified as potential copers and noncopers. Isokinetic quadriceps muscle tests were performed at 60 deg/s. Mean torque values were calculated for peak torque as well as for specific knee flexion angles. The 1-legged hop and the 6-m timed hop tests were included, and symmetry indices were used. Results: The peak torque value did not identify the largest quadriceps muscle strength deficit. Rather, these were established at knee flexion angles of less than 40°. There were significant differences in angle-specific torque values between potential copers and noncopers (P <.05). Moderate to strong associations were disclosed between angle-specific torque values and single-legged hop performance, but only for noncopers (r ≥.32-.58). Conclusion: Angle-specific quadriceps muscle torque values of less than 40° of knee flexion provide more information on the quadriceps strength deficits after ACL injury than the commonly used peak torque values. Interpretation of the isokinetic curve profiles seems to be of clinical importance for the evaluation of quadriceps muscle performance after ACL injury. © 2010 The Author(s).","ACL injury; angle-specific torque; isokinetic evaluation; peak torque; quadriceps strength","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; cross-sectional study; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; quadriceps femoris muscle; torque; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Quadriceps Muscle; Torque; Young Adult","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD037985); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Norges Idrettshøgskole, NIH, (1 HD 37985-04); Norges Idrettshøgskole, NIH","The authors of this study received research grants from NIH grant #RO1 HD 37985-04.

Few studies have assessed the factors involved in the development of osteoarthritis. Hypothesis: The following 10 factors will be found to be predictive of osteoarthritis: meniscectomy, chondral damage, patellar tendon grafting, age at surgery, time delay between injury and surgery, type and intensity of postsurgery sport, quadriceps strength, hamstring strength, quadriceps-to-hamstring strength ratio, and residual joint laxity. Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Fifty-six subjects with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were followed for 6 years after surgery. Assessment included KT-1000 arthrometer testing, isokinetic strength testing, a return-to-sport questionnaire, and a radiograph assessment. A discriminant analysis was performed to assess which of the 10 factors could discriminate between those patients who developed tibiofemoral and patellofemoral osteoarthritis and those who did not. Results: Five factors were found to be predictive of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. Meniscectomy (r =.72) and chondral damage (r =.41) were the strongest discriminators, followed by patellar tendon grafting (r =.37) (‡2 [7, n = 56] = 25.48; P =.001). Weak quadriceps (r =.39) and low quadriceps-to-hamstring strength ratios (r =.6) were very close discriminators (‡2 [8, n = 42] = 15.02; P =.059). For patellofemoral osteoarthritis, meniscectomy (r =.45), chondral damage (r =.75), and age at surgery (r =.65) were predictors or close predictors (‡2 [7, n = 54] = 13.30; P =.065). Conclusion: As not all 10 factors studied were predictive of osteoarthritis, the hypothesis was only partially proven. Preventing further meniscal and chondral damage in patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency is critical. Grafting using the hamstring tendons and restoration of quadriceps-to-hamstring strength balance are associated with less osteoarthritis. © 2010 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; meniscectomy; osteoarthritis; physiotherapy","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; Australia; bone patellar tendon bone graft; cohort analysis; convalescence; female; human; injury; knee injury; knee osteoarthritis; male; patient satisfaction; plastic surgery; risk factor; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patient Satisfaction; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison between medial meniscus repair, partial meniscectomy, and normal meniscus in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 307, pp. 165-173, (1994); Davies, Andrew Paul, Plain radiography in the degenerate knee.

Purpose: The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of hamstring isokinetic training used in the early phase of the rehabilitation program on the stability, strength, symptoms, and functional outcomes of patients throughout 12 months after anterior cruciate ligament surgery. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Forty-eight men underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an ipsilateral bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. The patients were randomly assigned to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 3 weeks (group I) or to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 9 weeks (group II). The patients were evaluated monthly for the first 4 months and at the 12th month for postoperative hamstring and quadriceps strength, as well as for knee function via the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale and International Knee Documentation Committee form. Results: Hamstring isometric strength at 30° of knee flexion (at the first and second months) and concentric isokinetic strength (at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months) at the angular velocity of 60 deg/s were significantly (P <.05-.01) greater in group I compared with group II. Average scores of the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale for symptoms were significantly (P <.05-.001) higher in group I compared with group II at all evaluation periods. Walking and stair-climbing scores at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months and squatting score at all evaluation periods were also better (P <.05-.01) in group I compared with group II. In addition, group I exhibited better (P <.01-.001) Lachman test results compared with group II for all postoperative evaluation periods. The International Knee Documentation Committee final rating scores were significantly (P <.01) greater at 2, 3, and 4 months in group I compared with group II. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that hamstring as well as quadriceps strength can be increased via early hamstring strengthening after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with no negative impact on knee function. © 2010 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; functional outcome; hamstring; isokinetic training; rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; human; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; kinesiotherapy; knee; knee injury; male; methodology; physiology; plastic surgery; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee; Knee Injuries; Male; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Barber-Westin, Sue D., Rigorous statistical reliability, validity, and responsiveness testing of the cincinnati knee rating system in 350 subjects with uninjured, injured, or anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knees, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 4, pp. 402-416, (1999); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior cruciate ligament injury rehabilitation in athletes: Biomechanical considerations, Sports Medicine, 22, 1, pp. 54-64, (1996); Beynnon, Bruce D., Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective, randomized, double-blind comparison of programs administered over 2 different time intervals, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 3, pp. 347-359, (2005); Magnus Bjordal, Jan Magnus, Epidemiology of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in soccer, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 3, pp. 341-345, (1997); Cooper, Randall L., A randomised controlled trial of proprioceptive and balance training after surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Research in Sports Medicine, 13, 3, pp. 217-230, (2005); Corry, Ian S., Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Hypotheses: Painful anterior knee tendons are common among elite badminton players. The anterior knee tendons exhibit colour Doppler activity. This activity increases after a match. Painful tendons have more Doppler activity than tendons without pain. Study design: Cohort study. Methods: 72 elite badminton players were interviewed about training, pain and injuries. The participants were scanned with high-end ultrasound equipment. Colour Doppler was used to examine the tendons of 64 players before a match and 46 players after a match. Intratendinous colour Doppler flow was measured as colour fraction (CF). The tendon complex was divided into three loci: the quadriceps tendon, the proximal patellar tendon and the insertion on the tibial tuberosity. Results: Interview: Of the 72 players, 62 players had problems with 86 tendons in the lower extremity. Of these 86 tendons, 48 were the anterior knee tendons. Ultrasound: At baseline, the majority of players (87%) had colour Doppler flow in at least one scanning position. After a match, the percentage of the knee complexes involved did not change. CF increased significantly in the dominant leg at the tibial tuberosity; single players had a significantly higher CF after a match at the tibial tuberosity and in the patellar tendon both before and after a match. Painful tendons had the highest colour Doppler activity. Conclusions: Most elite badminton players had pain in the anterior knee tendons and intratendinous Doppler activity both before and after match. High levels of Doppler activity were associated with self-reported ongoing pain.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; cohort analysis; Doppler flowmetry; echography; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; pain; patella ligament; sport; vascularization; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Pain; Patellar Ligament; Racquet Sports; Ultrasonography, Doppler; Young Adult","","","","","","","Jörgensen, Uffe, Injuries in Badminton, Sports Medicine, 10, 1, pp. 59-64, (1990); Renström, Per Anders F.H., Knee pain in tennis players, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 14, 1, pp. 163-175, (1995); Chard, Michael Denis, Racquet sports--patterns of injury presenting to a sports injury clinic., British journal of sports medicine, 21, 4, pp. 150-153, (1987); Høy, Kristian W., Badminton injuries - a prospective epidemiological and socioeconomic study, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 4, pp. 276-279, (1994); Jörgensen, Uffe, Epidemiology of badminton injuries, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 8, 6, pp. 379-382, (1987); Króner, Karsten, Badminton injuries, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 3, pp. 169-172, (1990); Blazina, Martin E., Jumper's knee., The Orthopedic clinics of North America, 4, 3, pp. 665-678, (1973); Roels, J., Patellar tendinitis (jumper's knee), American Journal of Sports Medicine, 6, 6, pp. 362-368, (1978); Mariani, Pierpaolo, Jumper's knee, Italian Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, 4, 1, pp. 85-93, (1978); Fornage, Bruno D., The hypoechoic normal tendon.

We sought to investigate the direct contribution of axial impact compressive load to anterior tibial load during simulated ski landing impact of intact knee joints without quadriceps activation. Twelve porcine knee specimens were procured. Four specimens were used as non-impact control while the remaining eight were mounted onto a material-testing system at 70° flexion and subjected to simulated landing impact, which was successively repeated with incremental actuator displacement. Four specimens from the impacted group underwent pre-impact MRI for tibial plateau angle measurements while the other four were subjected to histology and microCT for cartilage morphology and volume assessment. The tibial plateau angles ranged from 29.4 to 38.8°. There was a moderate linear relationship (Y=0.16X; R2=0.64; p<0.001) between peak axial impact compressive load (Y) and peak anterior tibial load (X). The anterior and posterior regions in the impacted group sustained surface cartilage fraying, superficial clefts and tidemark disruption, compared to the control group. MicroCT scans displayed visible cartilage deformation for both anterior and posterior regions in the impacted group. Due to the tibial plateau angle, increased axial impact compressive load can directly elevate anterior tibial load and hence contribute to ACL failure during simulated landing impact. Axial impact compressive load resulted in shear cartilage damage along anterior-posterior tibial plateau regions, due to its contribution to anterior tibial loading. This mechanism plays an important role in elevating ACL stress and cartilage deformation during impact landing. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior tibial load; Cartilage lesion; Impact landing; Peak axial impact compressive load","Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Anterior posteriors; Anterior tibial load; Axial impact; Cartilage damage; Control groups; Impact control; Incremental actuators; Knee joint; Landing impacts; Linear relationships; Micro CT; Pre-impact; Testing systems; Tibial plateau; Angle measurement; Cartilage; Computerized tomography; Deformation; Fluorine containing polymers; Joints (anatomy); Landing; Sports medicine; Ligaments; animal tissue; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone stress; cartilage; computer assisted tomography; computer simulation; controlled study; histology; jumping; knee; load carrying capacity; muscle examination; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; skiing; swine; tibialis anterior muscle; tissue injury; tissue structure; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Biomechanics; Compressive Strength; Humans; Knee Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Animal; Models, Biological; Skiing; Stress, Mechanical; Sus scrofa; Tibia; X-Ray Microtomography","","","","","National University of Singapore, NUS","This work was funded by the Academic Research Fund grant ( R175-000-062-112 ) from the National University of Singapore .

MATERIAL Group 1 included 20 patients undergoing reconstruction with quadriceps tendon- bone graft group; 2 comprised of 20 patients treated by hamstring graft. There were 26 men and 14 women, with an average age of 27 (range, 16 to 44) years. The minimum follow-up period was one year. METHODS In group 1 patients, semi-anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed by a three-tunnel technique (two tunnels in the femur and one in the tibia) using quadriceps femoris muscle graft. Group 2 patients were treated by anatomic four-tunnel reconstruction (two tunnels in the femur and two in the tibia) with the use of hamstring graft. Functional outcomes were evaluated on the basis of Lysholm and IKDC scores. Antero-posterior stability was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer and rotational stability was assessed by the pivot-shift test. For statistical evaluation, the level of significance (p) was set at < 0.05. RESULTS The final evaluation showed an average Lysholm score of 88.9 ± 12 (76-100) points for group 1, and 87.9 ± 11 (62-100) points for group 2; there was no statistically significant difference. The rounded average result of the functional IKDC score after surgery was the same in the two groups (80 ± 10). The joints treated by the three-tunnel technique had on average better antero-posterior stability, but this was not statistically significant. The pivot-shift phenomenon was not seen in either of the groups. Operative times in both groups were comparable. An intra-operative fracture of the patella occurred in two patients of group 1. DISCUSSION No similar prospective study comparing the outcomes of the methods reported here has been found in the international literature. The studies so far published have not included any such comparison or they compared other techniques, such as single- versus double-bundle reconstructions. CONCLUSIONS Based on Lysholm and IKDC score evaluation and antero-posterior and rotational stability assessment, it can be concluded that both the three- and the four-tunnel technique of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction gave similar results, with no significant differences, at one-year follow-up. However, these are only short-term results and only a long-term follow-up can prove or disprove the validity of this conclusion.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Clinical outcome; Hamstring tendon; Prospective; Quadriceps tendon; Two-bundle technique","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthrometry; article; bone graft; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; femur; follow up; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; male; operation duration; outcome assessment; patella; patella fracture; quadriceps tendon; scoring system; semitendinous muscle; surgical technique; tibia","","","","","","","Adachi, Nobuo, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 86, 4, pp. 515-520, (2004); Bellier, Guy, Double-stranded hamstring graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 20, 8, pp. 890-894, (2004); Edwards, Thomas Bradley, In vitro comparison of elongation of the anterior cruciate ligament and single- and dual-tunnel anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, Orthopedics, 22, 6, pp. 577-584, (1999); Grover, Dustin M., Early tension loss in an anterior cruciate ligament graft: A cadaver study of four tibial fixation devices, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 87, 2, pp. 381-390, (2005); Hamada, Masayuki, Single- versus bi-socket anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autogenous multiple-stranded hamstring tendons with EndoButton femoral fixation: A prospective study, Arthroscopy, 17, 8, pp. 801-807, (2001); Hart, Radek, Accurate placement of bone tunnels in reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament - A contribution of computer-assisted navigation, Acta Chirurgiae Orthopaedicae et Traumatologiae Cechoslovaca, 74, 2, pp. 118-125, (2007); Knee and the Cruciate Ligament, (1990); Janeček, M., Surgery of knee ligaments based on data of the First Orthopedic Clinic in Brno, Acta Chirurgiae Orthopaedicae et Traumatologiae Cechoslovaca, 52, 1, pp. 68-73, (1985); Järvelä, Timo, Double-bundle versus single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective, randomize clinical study, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 15, 5, pp. 500-507, (2007); Poraneni Mekkeho Kolena, (1945)","","","Galen s.r.o.","","","","","","00015415","","ACOTA","21059327","Czech","Acta Chir.

A good understanding of the anatomy and biomechanics of the knee assists accurate diagnosis of acute knee injuries. Objective: This article describes the assessment and management of sports knee injuries in the general practice setting. Discussion: When a patient presents with a sporting knee injury, a detailed history can help narrow down the nature of the injury. Examination can be difficult in the acute setting and may need to be repeated 3 or more days after the injury. Fractures can usually be excluded with plain X-rays; where indicated MRI or CT scan will usually confirm the diagnosis. Management aims are to manage pain, minimise knee swelling, maintain range of movement and quadriceps activation, and arrange appropriate referral. Medial collateral ligament, posterior cruciate ligament and some small meniscal injuries can usually be managed conservatively. Most meniscal injuries, anterior cruciate ligament and lateral collateral ligament injuries require surgical management. Physiotherapy is an integral part of the management of knee injuries in both the conservative and surgical settings.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Athletic injuries; Knee; Meniscal; Posterior cruciate ligament","article; Australia; human; knee injury; pathophysiology; radiography; sport injury; Athletic Injuries; Humans; Knee Injuries","","","","","","","General Practice Activity in Australia 2002 03, (2003); Heath Issues Joint Effort Proves Promising, (2006); Clinical Sports Medicine, (2001); Mitsou, Argyrios, Clinical diagnosis of ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament: a comparison between the Lachman test and the anterior drawer sign, Injury, 19, 6, pp. 427-428, (1988); Donaldson, William F., A comparison of acute anterior cruciate ligament examinations:Initial versus examination under anesthesia, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 1, pp. 5-10, (1985); Rubinstein, Richard A., The Accuracy of the Clinical Examination in the Setting of Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 4, pp. 550-557, (1994); Harilainen, Arsi, Evaluation of knee instability in acute ligamentous injuries., Annales chirurgiae et gynaecologiae, 76, 5, pp. 269-273, (1987); Fowler, Peter John, The predictive value of five clinical signs in the evaluation of meniscal pathology, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 5, 3, pp. 184-186, (1989); Sallay, Peter I., Acute dislocation of the patella: A correlative pathoanatomic study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 1, pp. 52-60, (1996)","B.

OBJECECTIVES: Determine effective interventions for improving readiness to return to sports postoperatively in patients with complete, unilateral, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture who do not compensate well after the injury (noncopers). Specifically, we compared the effects of 2 preoperative interventions on quadriceps strength and functional outcomes. BACKACKGROUND: The percentage of athletes who return to sports after ACL reconstruction varies considerably, possibly due to differential responses after acute ACL rupture and different management. Prognostic data for noncopers following ACL reconstruction is absent in the literature. METHODS: Forty noncopers were randomly assigned to receive either progressive quadriceps strength-training exercises (STR group) or perturbation training in conjunction with strength-training exercises (PERT group) for 10 preoperative rehabilitation sessions. Postoperative rehabilitation was similar between groups. Data on quadriceps strength indices [(involved limb/uninvolved limb force) × 100], 4 hop score indices, and 2 self-report questionnaires were collected preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare functional differences between the groups. Chi-square tests were used to compare frequencies of passing functional criteria and reasons for differences in performance between groups postoperatively. RESULTS: Functional outcomes were not different between groups, except a greater number of patients in the PERT group achieved global rating scores (current knee function expressed as a percentage of overall knee function prior to injury) necessary to pass return-to-sports criteria 6 and 12 months after surgery. Mean scores for each functional outcome met return-to-sports criteria 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Frequency counts of individual data, however, indicated that 5% of noncopers passed RTS criteria at 3, 48% at 6, and 78% at 12 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Functional outcomes suggest that a subgroup of noncopers require additional supervised rehabilitation to pass stringent criteria to return to sports.","ACL; Knee; Outcomes measures; Rehabilitation","","","","","","","","Ramos, J.

Methods: We evaluated 198 primary ACL reconstructions in 191 patients at a mean of 55.6 months postoperatively. Assessment included side-to-side comparison of range of motion, arthrometer values, presence of effusion, anterior knee pain, and numbness. Comparisons were made between QT and BQT patients and between men and women. The results were compared with data from 30 patients in a previous study who had undergone ACL reconstruction by the same surgeon (W.R.S.) with BPTB. Results: Range of motion averaged -3.2° ± 2.2° of extension to 134.3° ± 10.2° of flexion for the operative extremity compared with -3.6° ± 2.07° to 134.2° ± 10.6° for the contralateral extremity at final follow-up. KT-1000 manual maximum measurements (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) of the operative extremity averaged 0.94 mm more than those of the normal contralateral knee. When compared with BPTB autograft, the quadriceps tendon autograft showed significantly better results, with less anterior knee pain (4.56% v 26.7%), less anterior numbness (1.5% v 53.3%), a higher percentage of arthrometer measurements showing a side-to-side difference of 0 to 3 mm (88% v 68%), and better extension (mean loss, 0.55° v 2.77°). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to loss of flexion, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, presence of effusion, or number of failures. Conclusions: Central quadriceps tendon autograft, QT or BQT, produces equivalent results when compared directly with BPTB autograft in arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction. There was no difference in results between men and women with a quadriceps tendon autograft, either with or without the use of a bone plug. ACL reconstruction using quadriceps tendon autograft is an effective surgical option that reduces donor-site morbidity.

The goal of this study was to assess the force-velocity parameters of the knee flexors and extensors in patients 13 weeks after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Material and methods. The study involved 13 men aged 18-34. All patients underwent an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the 4th Military Hospital in Wroclaw. An assessment of the force-velocity parameters of the knee flexors and extensors of both limbs was performed in all subjects under isokinetic conditions (180% loads). Each subject performed five flexion and extension movements in the knee joint in the sagittal plane. All subjects were instructed to release maximum peak torque in the shortest possible time in each movement. Results. Statistically significant deficits of peak torque, maximum work and average power were registered in the operated limb. The deficits exceeded 30% for all parameters evaluated. Conclusions. 1. Functional impairment following ACL reconstruction is seen predominantly in the quadriceps femoris, as confirmed by a higher H/Q ratio in peak torque compared to the healthy limb. 2. Reliable assessment of knee muscle function in patients after ACL reconstruction allows calculation of the degree of deficit of force-velocity parameters, making it possible to design an optimal rehabilitation programme for each patient. © MEDSPORTPRESS, 2009.","ACL; Hamstring/quadriceps ratio; Peak torque","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; exercise tolerance; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; methodology; muscle contraction; muscle isometric contraction; pathophysiology; physiology; pilot study; plastic surgery; quadriceps femoris muscle; stretching exercise; torque; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Exercise Tolerance; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Stretching Exercises; Pilot Projects; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Torque; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Artroskopia I Chi Rurgia Stawow, (2007); Acta Clin, (2001); Czamara, Andrzej, The alteration of the value of muscle forces in the programme of physiotherapy after the reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligaments, Fizjoterapia Polska, 2, 4, pp. 263-272, (2002); Dzierzanowski, Maciej, Proprioception as one of the factors deciding on the model of rehabilitation after reconstruction of ACL, Ortopedia Traumatologia Rehabilitacja, 5, 4, pp. 534-538, (2003); J Athl Train, (1993); Kwart Ortopedyczny, (2006); Acta Clinica, (2002); Anerior Cruciate Ligament Injury, (2006); Acta Clinica, (2002); A Compendium of Isokinetics in Clinical Usage and Rehabilitation Techniques, (1992)","M.

However, the effects of these parameters on dynamic stance balance in such patients are currently unknown. This study was undertaken to ascertain whether proprioception, muscle strength, and knee laxity are correlated with dynamic standing balance in patients with ACL deficiency. Ten young men with unilateral ACL deficiency participated in this study. The mean time interval from the injury to the study was 12.8 months. Knee laxity measurements, passive re-positioning (PRP) and threshold for detection of passive motion (TTDPM) proprioception tests, quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength tests, and dynamic single-limb balance tests were performed for both injured and uninjured limbs. Significant differences between the injured and uninjured sides were observed for all test parameters. As independent variables, knee laxity, PRP proprioception, and muscle strength did not correlate with dynamic standing balance for the injured limb. However, a significant positive correlation (P < 0.05) between TTDPM proprioception and dynamic single-limb stance balance was observed for the injured limb. To improve dynamic single-limb stance balance in patients with ACL injuries, training in TTDPM proprioceptive ability is recommended as the most important initial approach for such patients. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty one unilateral knee patients (16 men, 5 women), mostly with ACL pathology, with a mean post-injury time of 36 ± 33 m, were conveniently sampled. All patients filled in a functional questionnaire which indicated good recovery. The relative weakness of the involved (I) side was determined using the uninvolved (U) side as reference. Patients were also asked to rank the difficulty in performing the tests. The mean (based on the 4 velocities) eccentric weakness (19.7%) was significantly higher than in both the concentric (14.9%) or the isomteric (13.9%) modes. However within either the concentric or eccentric modes no between-velocity differences were noted. Side dominance had a significant effect on quadriceps weakness in all test modes. In conclusion, and with respect to the specific patient group, the use of one or, at most, two test velocities is sufficient to portray muscular insufficiency. © 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of early repair or nonoperative treatment of a concomitant medial collateral ligament injury on range of motion of the knee and quadriceps muscle strength in patients with combined injuries. Methods: Forty-seven consecutive patients with combined anterior cruciate and grade-III medial collateral ligament injuries were randomized into two groups. The medial collateral ligament was repaired in Group I (n = 23) and was treated nonoperatively in Group II (n = 24). In both groups, the torn anterior cruciate ligament was treated with early reconstruction. The patients were evaluated on the basis of sequential range-of-motion measurements, the one-leg-hop test, and isokinetic muscle power measurements at the time of follow-up, and the findings were compared between the two treatment groups. Results: All patients achieved full knee extension. At all follow-up intervals the flexion deficit was greater in the group that had been managed with surgical repair of both ligaments, but the difference was significant only at six weeks (100° compared with 112°; p = 0.009), twelve weeks (119° compared with 128°; p = 0.043), and thirty-six weeks (130° compared with 136°; p = 0.011) after the operation. The difference between the groups was not significant at fifty-two weeks (132° compared with 137°) or 104 weeks (134° compared with 137°). The quadriceps muscle power deficit at fifty-two weeks was 30.7% in the group that had been managed with combined repair and 20.5% in the group that had been managed with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction only (p = 0.015). At 104 weeks, the deficits were 14.4% and 9.7%, respectively (p = 0.2). Conclusions: Early operative treatment of combined anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament injuries is possible without increased long-term mobilization complications. The rehabilitation period is long, and aggressive physiotherapy is recommended. However, nonoperative treatment of the torn medial collateral ligament allows faster restoration of flexion and quadriceps muscle power. Our results favor nonoperative treatment of the torn medial collateral ligament in patients with combined injuries. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level II.

Several methods for graft fixation have been described. To avoid intra-articular hardware we adopt biological fixation with a femoral trapezoidal press-fit fixation. A prospective study was performed on 30 consecutive active people who underwent ACL reconstruction with this technique by two surgeons between septem-ber2004 and march2007 (mean follow-up 15.2 months). Results were evaluated by an independent examiner using radiography, subjective and objective evaluation. Assessment using the IKDC knee scoring revealed 92% of the patients with a normal or nearly normal knee joint. Lysholm's score was 63.6(40-86) preoperatively and 91.88(73-100) at the latest follow up (P < 0.005). No patient complained of instability at latest follow up. The quadriceps muscle showed mild atrophy at 3 and 6 months and at final follow-up. Five Patients complained of anterior knee pain and had a positive kneeling test. We found no graft displacement on follow up radiographs. All cases showed radiological evidence of graft osteointegration at last follow up. Our results show that press-fit fixation of trapezoidal bone graft in femoral tunnel is a simple, reliable, and cost-effective alternative for ACL reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. © 2009 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury or reconstruction can cause knee impairments and disability. Knee impairments are related to quadriceps performance - accelerated reaction time (ART) - anddisability to performance of daily living activities which is assessed by questionnaires such as the Lysholm knee score. The purposes of this study were to investigate the effect of cross exercise, as supplementary rehabilitation to the early phase of ACL reconstruction: a) on quadriceps ART at the angles 45°, 60° and 90° of knee flexion and, b) on the subjective scores of disability in ACL reconstructed patients. Methods: 42 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly divided into 3 groups, two experimental and one control. All groups followed the same rehabilitation program. The experimental groups followed 8 weeks of cross eccentric exercise (CEE) on the uninjured knee; 3 d/w, and 5 d/w respectively. Quadriceps ART was measured at 45°, 60° and 90° of knee flexion pre and nine weeks post-operatively using an isokinetic dynamometer. Patients also completed pre and post operatively the Lysholm questionnaire whereby subjective scores were recorded. Results: Two factor ANOVA showed significant differences in ART at 90° among the groups (F = 4.29, p = 0.02, p 0.05). Post hoc Tukey HSD analysis determined that the significant results arose from the first experimental group in comparison to the control (D = -0.83, p = 0.01). No significant differences were revealed at 45° and 60°. Significant differences were also found in the Lysholm score among the groups (F = 4.75, p = 0.01, p 0.05). Post hoc analysis determined that the above significant results arose from the first experimental group in comparison with the control (D = 7.5, p 0.01) and from the second experimental in comparison with the control (D = 3.78, p = 0.03). Conclusion: CEE showed improvements on quadriceps ART at 90° at a sequence of 3 d/w and in the Lysholm score at a sequence of 3 d/w and 5 d/w respectively on ACL reconstructed patients.","","","","","","","","","McHugh, Malachy P., Preoperative indicators of motion loss and weakness following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 27, 6, pp. 407-411, (1998); Lephart, Scott M., Relationship between selected physical characteristics and functional capacity in the anterior cruciate ligament-insufficient athlete, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 16, 4, pp. 174-181, (1992); Risberg, May Arna G., Prospective study of changes in impairments and disabilities after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 29, 7, pp. 400-412, (1999); Tegner, Yelverton, Rating systems in the evaluation of knee ligament injuries, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 198, pp. 43-49, (1985); Keays, Susan L., Strength and function before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 373, pp. 174-183, (2000); Konishi, Yu, Possible mechanism of quadriceps femoris weakness in patients with ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 34, 9, pp. 1414-1418, (2002); Snyder-Mackler, Lynn, Reflex inhibition of the quadriceps femoris muscle after injury or reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 76, 4, pp. 555-560, (1994); Arangio, George A., Thigh muscle size and strength after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and rehabilitation, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 26, 5, pp. 238-243, (1997); Suter, Esther, Extent of muscle inhibition as a function of knee angle, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 7, 2, pp. 123-130, (1997); Aune, Arne Kristian, Quadriceps muscle contraction protects the anterior cruciate ligament during anterior tibial translation, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 2, pp. 187-190, (1997)","M.

Surgical repair or reconstruction seems to achieve results superior to conservative treatment. Various methods of reconstructing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) after knee dislocation have been described, but few reports discuss simultaneous ACL and PCL reconstructions in a single operation. METHODS: Eleven consecutive patients (6 males and 5 females) with both ACL and PCL disruptions were enrolled in the prospective study and treated with arthroscopic combined reconstruction of ACL and PCL using hamstring and quadriceps tendon autografts in a single operation. The average period from injury to operation was 76 days (range, 30-150 days), and the mean age was 33 years (range, 19-48 years) for those who underwent the operation. Mean follow-up time was 55 months (range, 36-78 months). Follow-up examinations included Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, thigh muscle assessment, and radiographic evaluation. RESULTS: Ten of 11 (91%) patients showed good or excellent results. Statistically significant improvements were observed in Lysholm score (p = 0.008), Tegner score (p = 0.038), postoperative KT-1000 scores (p = 0.001), final IKDC rating (p = 0.032), and thigh atrophy and muscle strength (p < 0.05). Regarding IKDC final rating, 82% (9 of 11) of the patients were assessed as normal or nearly normal (grade A or B). CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of both ACL and PCL using hamstring and quadriceps autografts can effectively and safely restore knee stability. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","ACL/PCL reconstruction; Hamstring and quadriceps tendon autograft","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopic surgery; article; brace; clinical article; clinical trial; exercise; female; follow up; hamstring; human; knee dislocation; knee instability; knee ligament injury; male; posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; postoperative complication; priority journal; quadriceps tendon; range of motion; range of motion restriction; rating scale; scoring system; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; bone screw; dislocation; injury; knee injury; knee ligament; methodology; middle aged; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Screws; Dislocations; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Tendons; Tissue and Organ Harvesting; Young Adult","","","","","","","O'Neill, Daniel B., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A prospective randomized analysis of three techniques, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 78, 6, pp. 803-813, (1996); Chan, Yisheng, Arthroscopic Reconstruction of the Posterior Cruciate Ligament With Use of a Quadruple Hamstring Tendon Graft With 3- to 5-Year Follow-up, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 7, pp. 762-770, (2006); Pinczewski, Leo A., Arthroscopic posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using four- strand hamstring tendon graft and interference screws, Arthroscopy, 13, 5, pp. 661-665, (1997); Meyers, Marvin H., Traumatic dislocation of the knee joint, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 57, 3, pp. 430-433, (1975); Almekinders, Louis C., Results following treatment of traumatic dislocations of the knee joint, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 284, pp. 203-207, (1992); Ibrahim, Samir Abdul Razik, Primary repair of the cruciate and collateral ligaments after traumatic dislocation of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 81, 6, pp. 987-990, (1999); Richter, Martinus, Comparison of surgical repair or reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments versus nonsurgical treatment in patients with traumatic knee dislocations, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 5, pp. 718-727, (2002); Shelbourne, K.

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction done with a double-bundle technique with use of a quadriceps tendon-bone autograft and that of a single-bundle reconstruction with use of a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft in patients with generalized ligamentous laxity. Methods: The records of sixty-one patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between June 2002 and October 2005 were evaluated. Thirty-two patients underwent a single-bundle reconstruction (group 1), and twenty-nine patients underwent a double-bundle reconstruction (group 2). Clinical outcomes were determined from data obtained before surgery and at the twenty-four-month follow-up visit. Results: Postoperatively, the mean side-to-side difference (and standard deviation) in anterior tibial translation, measured with use of a KT-2000 arthrometer, wasgreaterforgroup 1 (3.37 ± 1.76 mm; range, 1.00 to 8.00 mm) than for group 2 (2.03 ± 1.11 mm; range, 0.00 to 3.50 mm) (p = 0.02). Three patients in group 1 had a grade-1+ pivot shift, while no patient in group 2 had an abnormal pivot shift. The mean score on the Hospital for Special Surgery knee ligament questionnaire was 90.8 in group 1 and 92.1 in group 2, and the mean Lysholm score was 89.4 in group 1 and 91.1 in group 2. Conclusions: On the basis of the evaluation of ligamentous laxity measured by the KT-2000 arthrometer, a double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of a quadriceps tendon-bone autograft allows less anterior translation than does a single-bundle reconstruction with use of a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. However, we could not identify a significant difference in the functional outcome between the two techniques. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III.

Methods: Eight human cadaveric knees were sequentially tested using a robotic testing system under 4 conditions: intact, ACL deficiency, ACL deficiency with subtotal medial meniscectomy, and single-bundle ACL reconstruction using a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. Knee kinematics were measured at 0°, 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion under an anterior tibial load of 130 N and a quadriceps muscle load of 400 N. Results: Subtotal medial meniscectomy in the ACL-deficient knee significantly increased anterior and lateral tibial translations under the anterior tibial and quadriceps loads (P < .05). These kinematic changes were larger at high flexion (≥60°) than at low flexion angles. ACL reconstruction in knees with ACL deficiency and subtotal medial meniscectomy significantly reduced the increased anterior tibial translation, but could not restore anterior translation to the intact level with differences ranging from 2.6 mm at 0° to 5.5 mm at 30° of flexion. ACL reconstruction did not significantly affect the medial-lateral translation and internal-external tibial rotation in the presence of subtotal meniscectomy. Conclusions: Subtotal medial meniscectomy in knees with ACL deficiency altered knee kinematics, especially at high flexion angles. ACL reconstruction significantly reduced the increased tibial translation in knees with combined ACL deficiency and subtotal medial meniscectomy, but could not restore the knee kinematics to the intact knee level. Clinical Relevance: This study suggests that meniscus is an important secondary stabilizer against anterior and lateral tibial translations and should be preserved in the setting of ACL reconstruction for restoration of optimal knee kinematics and function. © 2009 Arthroscopy Association of North America.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Knee kinematics; Reconstruction; Subtotal medial meniscectomy","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; cadaver; female; human; in vitro study; joint mobility; kinematics; knee function; knee meniscus; male; meniscectomy; quadriceps femoris muscle; robotics; subtotal medial meniscectomy; tibia; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Biomechanics; Bone Transplantation; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Aged; Motion; Patellar Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Robotics; Transplantation, Autologous; Weight-Bearing","","","","","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R01AR055612)","","Boyd, Kevin T., Meniscus preservation; rationale, repair techniques and results, Knee, 10, 1, pp. 1-11, (2003); Fairbank, Thomas J., Knee joint changes after meniscectomy., The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of knee impairment and psychological variables with function in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Hypothesis: After controlling for demographic variables, knee impairment and psychological variables contribute to function in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 4a. Methods: Fifty-eight subjects with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction completed a standardized testing battery for knee impairments (range of motion, effusion, quadriceps strength, anterior knee joint laxity, and pain intensity), kinesiophobia (shortened Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia), and function (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective form and single-legged hop test). Separate 2-step regression analyses were conducted with International Knee Documentation Committee subjective form score and single-legged hop index as dependent variables. Demographic variables were entered into the model first, followed by knee impairment measures and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia score. Results: A combination of pain intensity, quadriceps index, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia score, and flexion motion deficit contributed to the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective form score (adjusted r 2 = 0.67; P <.001). Only effusion contributed to the single-legged hop index (adjusted r 2 = 0.346; P =.002). Conclusion: Knee impairment and psychological variables in this study were associated with self-report of function, not a performance test. Clinical Relevance: The results support focusing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction rehabilitation on pain, knee motion deficits, and quadriceps strength, as well as indicate that kinesiophobia should be addressed. Further research is needed to reveal which clinical tests are associated with performance testing. © 2009 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","ACL; Knee; Outcomes; Practice guidelines; Rehabilitation","","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Bone-patellar tendon-bone compared with double semitendinosus and gracilis tendon grafts - A prospective, randomized clinical trial, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 86, 10, pp. 2143-2155, (2004); Orthopaedic Section Independent Study Course 15 3 Postoperative Management of Orthopaedic Surgeries, (2005); Barrack, Robert L., Proprioception in the anterior cruciate deficient knee, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 1-6, (1989); Beynnon, Bruce D., Treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, part I, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 10, pp. 1579-1602, (2005); Bolgla, Lori A., Reliability of lower extremity functional performance tests, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 26, 3, pp. 138-142, (1997); Bost, James E., The 8-item Short-Form Health Survey and the physical comfort composite score of the quality of recovery 40-item scale provide the most responsive assessments of pain, physical function, and mental function during the first 4 days after ambulatory knee surgery with regional anesthesia, Anesthesia and Analgesia, 105, 6, pp. 1693-1700, (2007); Brosseau, Lucie U., Intra- and intertester reliability and criterion validity of the parallelogram and universal goniometers for measuring maximum active knee flexion and extension of patients with knee restrictions, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 82, 3, pp. 396-402, (2001); Currier, Linda L., Development of a clinical prediction rule to identify patients with knee pain and clinical evidence of knee osteoarthritis who demonstrate a favorable short-term response to hip mobilization, Physical Therapy, 87, 9, pp. 1106-1119, (2007); Ferrari, James D., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in men and women: An outcome analysis comparing gender, Arthroscopy, 17, 6, pp. 588-596, (2001); Flynn, Timothy W., A clinical prediction rule for classifying patients with low back pain who demonstrate short-term improvement with spinal manipulation, Spine, 27, 24, pp. 2835-2843, (2002)","T.

METHOD: 54 patients (9 women, 45 men, body mass index [BMI] 25.3 [18.1-36.3 kg/m (2)]) were included in this prospective series, treated between January 2004 and December 2005. Ligament stability was assessed with the Lachmann and pivot-shift tests and a KT 1000 arthrometer. Tegner index, Lysholm-Gilquist score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) were employed to evaluate the functional outcomes. In addition, the single leg hop test was performed. RESULTS: Ligament arthrometry using the KT 1000 arthrometer demonstrated a mean side-to-side difference of 1.53 mm (0.2-4.1 mm). Regarding the Lachmann test, 17 patients (32%) showed 1+ laxity and no patient had an abnormal pivot-shift. The mean Tegner activity score was 4.22 (1-10), the mean Lysholm score was 80.8 (20-100) and the mean IKDC score 68.1 (29-87). Results of the single leg hop test revealed a mean decline of the treated leg to 87.7% (70-100%) of the contralateral side. The mean extension was reduced by 1.7 degrees (0-10 degrees) on the treated knee and the flexion by 2.1 degrees (0-10 degrees), compared to the contralateral knee. CONCLUSION: Single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadriceps tendon demonstrates highly satisfactory results. Due to a moderate donor site morbidity and preservation of the medial stabilizing structures of the knee a wider use in primary cruciate ligament reconstruction may arise in the future.

Patellar fracture is a rare but significant complication following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction when using a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft. The purpose of these case reports is to describe 2 cases in which patellar fracture occurred during rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction using a BPTB. Both patients were 23-year-old males referred for rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction using a BPTB autograft. They were both progressing satisfactorily in rehabilitation until sustaining a fracture of the patella. One fracture occurred during the performance of the eccentric phase of a knee extension exercise during the sixth week of rehabilitation (7 weeks postsurgery), whereas the other fracture oc-curred during testing of the patient's quadriceps maximum voluntary isometric contraction in the ninth week of rehabilitation (10 weeks postsur- gery). Both patients were subsequently treated with open reduction and internal fixation of the patella. During rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction using BPTB autograft, clinicians should consider the need to balance the sometimes-competing goals of improving quadriceps strength while providing protection to the healing graft, minimization of patellofemoral pain, and protection of the patellar donor site.","ACL; Failure; Knee; Load; Strain","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; case report; differential diagnosis; fracture; human; innervation; kinesiotherapy; knee injury; male; methodology; patella; plastic surgery; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Diagnosis, Differential; Exercise Therapy; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Patella; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Young Adult","","","","","","","Adriani, Ezio, Healing of the patellar tendon after harvesting of its mid-third for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and evolution of the unclosed donor site defect, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 3, pp. 138-143, (1995); Almazán, Arturo, Intraoperative Incidents and Complications in Primary Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 11, pp. 1211-1217, (2006); Arvidsson, Inga, Isokinetic thigh muscle strength after ligament reconstruction in the knee joint: Results from a 5-10 year follow-up after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee joint, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 1, pp. 7-11, (1981); Aune, Arne Kristian, Quadriceps muscle contraction protects the anterior cruciate ligament during anterior tibial translation, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 2, pp. 187-190, (1997); Benson, Eric R., A delayed transverse avulsion fracture of the superior pole of the patella after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 14, 1, pp. 85-88, (1998); Berg, Eugene E., Management of patella fractures associated with central third bone- patella tendon-bone autograft ACL reconstructions, Arthroscopy, 12, 6, pp. 756-759, (1996); Besier, Thor F., Patellofemoral joint contact area increases with knee flexion and weight-bearing, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 23, 2, pp. 345-350, (2005); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain Behavior During Rehabilitation Exercises In Vivo, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 24-34, (1995); Beynnon, Bruce D., The strain behavior of the anterior cruciate ligament during squatting and active flexion-extension.

Women tend to land in greater knee valgus with higher abduction loads than men. Because knee abduction loads increase ACL strain, the inability to minimize these loads may lead to ACL failure. Objective: To investigate the activation patterns of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles with respect to the peak knee abduction moment. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Neuromuscular research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-one recreationally active adults (11 women, 10 men). Main Outcome Measure(s): Volunteers performed 3 trials of a 100-cm forward hop. During the hop task, we recorded surface electromyographic data from the medial and lateral hamstrings and quadriceps and recorded lower extremity kinematics and kinetics. Lateral and medial quadriceps-tohamstrings (Q:H) cocontraction indices, the ratio of medial-tolateral Q:H cocontraction, normalized root mean square electromyographic data for medial and lateral quadriceps and hamstrings, and peak knee abduction moment were calculated and used in data analyses. Results: Overall cocontraction was lower in women than in men, whereas activation was lower in the medial than in the lateral musculature in both sexes (P < .05). The medial Q:H cocontraction index (R2 = 0.792) accounted for a significant portion of the variance in the peak knee abduction moment in women (P = .001). Women demonstrated less activation in the vastus medialis than in the vastus lateralis (P = .49) and less activation in the medial hamstrings than in the lateral hamstrings (P = .01). Conclusions: Medial-to-lateral Q:H cocontraction appears to be unbalanced in women, which may limit their ability to resist abduction loads. Because higher abduction loads increase strain on the ACL, restoring medial-to-lateral Q:H cocontraction balance in women may help reduce ACL injury risk. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomechanics; Coactivation; Landings; Neuromuscular system","abduction; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; correlation analysis; electromyography; female; ground reaction force; hamstring; human; human experiment; jumping; knee; knee function; male; muscle contraction; normal human; quadriceps femoris muscle; sex difference; vastus lateralis muscle; vastus medialis muscle","","","","","","","Arendt, Elizabeth Anne, Knee Injury Patterns Among Men and Women in Collegiate Basketball and Soccer: NCAA Data and Review of Literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 694-701, (1995); Gwinn, David E., The relative incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury in men and women at the United States Naval Academy, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 1, pp. 98-102, (2000); Huston, Laura J., Anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the female athlete: Potential risk factors, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 372, pp. 50-63, (2000); Griffin, Letha Yurko Etty, Noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries: risk factors and prevention strategies., The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 8, 3, pp. 141-150, (2000); Hewett, Timothy E., Biomechanical measures of neuromuscular control and valgus loading of the knee predict anterior cruciate ligament injury risk in female athletes: A prospective study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 4, pp. 492-501, (2005); McLean, Scott G., Association between lower extremity posture at contact and peak knee valgus moment during sidestepping: Implications for ACL injury, Clinical Biomechanics, 20, 8, pp. 863-870, (2005); McLean, Scott G., Impact of fatigue on gender-based high-risk landing strategies, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 39, 3, pp. 502-514, (2007); 51st Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society February 23 28 2005 Washington Dc; McLean, Scott G., Sagittal plane biomechanics cannot injure the ACL during sidestep cutting, Clinical Biomechanics, 19, 8, pp. 828-838, (2004); Lloyd, David G., Strategies of muscular support of varus and valgus isometric loads at the human knee, Journal of Biomechanics, 34, 10, pp. 1257-1267, (2001)","R.

The authors previously reported that focused eccentric resistance training during the first 15 weeks following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) induced greater short-term increases in muscle volume, strength, and measures of function relative to standard rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of early progressive eccentric exercise on muscle volume and function at 1 year after ACL-R. Participants and Methods. Forty patients who had undergone an ACL-R were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: a group that received early progressive eccentric exercise (n=20) and a group that received standard rehabilitation (n=20). Seventeen participants in the eccentric exercise group and 15 participants in the standard rehabilitation group completed a 1-year follow-up. Magnetic resonance images of the thighs were acquired 1 year after ACL-R and compared with images acquired 3 weeks after surgery. Likewise, routine knee examinations, self-report assessments, and strength and functional testing were completed 1 year after surgery and compared with previous evaluations. A 2-factor analysis of variance for repeated measures (group X time) was used to analyze the data. Results. Compared with the standard rehabilitation group, improvements in quadriceps femoris and gluteus maximus muscle volume in the involved lower extremity from 3 weeks to 1 year following ACL-R were significantly greater in the eccentric exercise group. Improvements in quadriceps femoris and gluteus maximus muscle volume were 23.3% (SD=14.1%) and 20.6% (SD=12.9%), respectively, in the eccentric exercise group and 13.4% (SD=10.3%) and 11.6% (SD=10.4%), respectively, in the standard rehabilitation group. Improvements in quadriceps femoris muscle strength and hopping distance also were significantly greater in the eccentric exercise group 1 year postsurgery. Discussion and Conclusions. A 12-week focused eccentric resistance training program, implemented 3 weeks after ACL-R, resulted in greater increases in quadriceps femoris and gluteus maximus muscle volume and function compared with standard rehabilitation at 1 year following ACL-R. © 2009 American Physical Therapy Association.","","Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Buttocks; Early Ambulation; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle Strength; Organ Size; Quadriceps Muscle; Recovery of Function; Resistance Training; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Gerber, John Parry, Effects of early progressive eccentric exercise on muscle structure after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 89, 3, pp. 559-570, (2007); Gerber, John Parry, Safety, feasibility, and efficacy of negative work exercise via eccentric muscle activity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 37, 1, pp. 10-18, (2007); Gerber, John Parry, Early application of negative work via eccentric ergometry following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A case report, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 36, 5, pp. 298-307, (2006); Hortobágyi, Tibor, Greater initial adaptations to submaximal muscle lengthening than maximal shortening, Journal of Applied Physiology, 81, 4, pp. 1677-1682, (1996); Hortobágyi, Tibor, Changes in muscle strength, muscle fibre size and myofibrillar gene expression after immobilization and retraining in humans, Journal of Physiology, 524, 1, pp. 293-304, (2000); Hortobágyi, Tibor, Adaptive responses to muscle lengthening and shortening in humans, Journal of Applied Physiology, 80, 3, pp. 765-772, (1996); LaStayo, Paul C., The positive effects of negative work: Increased muscle strength and decreased fall risk in a frail elderly population, Journals of Gerontology - Series A Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences, 58, 5, pp. 419-424, (2003); LaStayo, Paul C., Eccentric ergometry: Increases in locomotor muscle size and strength at low training intensities, American Journal of Physiology - Regulatory Integrative and Comparative Physiology, 278, 5 47-5, pp. R1282-R1288, (2000); Moher, David, The CONSORT statement: Revised recommendations for improving the quality of reports of parallel-group randomized trials, Annals of Internal Medicine, 134, 8, pp. 657-662, (2001); Tegner, Yelverton, Rating systems in the evaluation of knee ligament injuries, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 198, pp. 43-49, (1985)","J.

The best series report 80 to 90% success, irrespective of the type of operation. The purpose of this work was to investigate resumption of sports activities after ACL reconstruction. We studied the impact of the conditions of sports activity after the operation, gender, type of sport, presence of an extra-articular reinforcement and time since surgery. Material and method: In order to search for significant differences between the postoperative and follow-up scores, a questionnaire with a subjective IKDC grid was addressed 12 months after their hospitalization to all athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction at the CERS from 1st January, 2003 through 31st October, 2004. Results: For the period considered, 2248 athletes were hospitalized at the CERS for ACL reconstruction. The response rate was 43% (969 responses at 12 months). There was no significant difference between the hospitalized population and the responders in terms of type of sports activity or type of graft. There was however a significant female predominance among responders (p = 0.01). Mean follow-up was 13.9 ± 2.9 months. Reconstruction methods were: hamstring graft 54%, free patellar graft 43%, MacIntosh fascia lata 2%, MacIntosh quadriceps 1%. The main activity was a pivot sport for 74% of the athletes. Male gender predominated: 77%. There was no difference regarding postoperative training, but competition level was achieved more readily by males (65% versus 54%, p = 0.0038), since more females stated resumption of competition was not an objective. It was also noted that resumption of training occurred earlier for gliding sports than for pivot-contact sports (7.32 ± 2.09 months versus 8.23 ± 2.66 months, p = 0.021). The presence of a lateral reinforcement did not have a significant impact on resumption of sports activities which was more frequent in the hamstring group than the patellar group (16% versus 7%, p < 0.0001) and more frequent in the pivot-contact sports (p = 0.0039). Regarding the role of the surgical technique, resumption of training and competition was better after hamstring plasty compared with patellar tendon plasty for follow-up less than or equal to 12 months (p = 0.0009 and 0.0001 respectively). The subjective IKDC score was also significantly better in the hamstring group for the period considered (p = 0.0006). The differences observed early in the follow-up resolved over time and no significant difference was observed at 18 and 22 months. Regarding the MacIntosh fascia lata plasty, resumption of competition was significantly earlier (7.67 ± 1.87 months) compared with hamstring plasty (9.69 ± 2.58 months) and patellar tendon plasty (9.65 ± 3 months). Resumption of training (90%) and competition (76%) was also better with the MacIntosh fascia lata plasty compared with the two other techniques but the difference was not significant. These differences, in favor of the MacIntosh fascia lata plasty, might have been due to a recruitment bias since the level of the sports activities was significantly higher in the MacIntosh population than in the populations of the other two methods. Conclusion: This study is of particular interest because of the size of the homogeneous study population resulting from the highly selective recruitment of athletes at the CERS. This study is generally in agreement with prior data in the literature, particularly concerning the rate of resumed training one year after surgery. This study shows that the patellar tendon plasty reaches maturity more slowly than the hamstring plasty although the two techniques yielded comparable results at 18 months for all criteria studied. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Since there are controversies surrounding the overall recovery time of proprioception following surgery, it is necessary to define the factors affecting proprioceptive recovery after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and to investigate the relationship between proprioception and muscle strength. Methods: A total of 36 patients who had their ACL reconstructed with a semitendinosus/gracilis graft (reconstructed group: 6 months post-surgery) and 13 healthy adults without any knee injury (control group) were included in the study. Knee proprioception was evaluated with a passive reproduction test. Isokinetic strength was measured using the Biodex System. Statistical analysis was used to compare proprioception of the reconstructed group versus the control group, and to define causal factors, including sex, hamstring/quadriceps ratio, and the course of injury before reconstruction. We also investigated the correlation between the passive reproduction error and quadriceps index. Results: There was a significant difference in proprioception between the reconstructed and control groups (P <0.05). When the course of injury before reconstruction was less than 4 months, there was a linear correlation with proprioception 6 months after the operation (r=0.713, P <0.05). There was a positive correlation between post-surgery proprioception and the quadriceps index at 6 months post-surgery. Conclusions: Impaired knee proprioception is observed 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Within 4 months of injury, early undertaking of reconstruction is associated with better proprioception outcome. Patients with enhanced proprioception have a better quadriceps index.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Muscle strength; Proprioception","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; clinical article; controlled study; disease course; early intervention; female; follow up; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; isokinetic exercise; joint mobility; knee; male; muscle graft; muscle strength; outcomes research; proprioception; quadriceps femoris muscle; rehabilitation care; semitendinous muscle","","","","","","","Krogsgaard, Michael Rindom, Cruciate ligament reflexes, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 12, 3, pp. 177-182, (2002); Park, Hyung-bin, Mapping the rat somatosensory pathway from the anterior cruciate ligament nerve endings to the cerebrum, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 23, 6, pp. 1419-1424, (2005); Reider, Bruce, Proprioception of the knee before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 19, 1, pp. 2-12, (2003); Bonfim, Thátia Regina, Proprioceptive and behavior impairments in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 84, 8, pp. 1217-1223, (2003); Hopper, Diana M., Functional measurement of knee joint position sense after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 84, 6, pp. 868-872, (2003); Roberts, David, Bilateral proprioceptive defects in patients with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A comparison between patients and healthy individuals, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 18, 4, pp. 565-571, (2000); Aydoǧ, Sedat Tolga, Decrease in the numbers of mechanoreceptors in rabbit ACL: The effects of ageing, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 14, 4, pp. 325-329, (2006); Fridèn, Thomas, Proprioception in the nearly extended knee: Measurements of position and movement in healthy individuals and in symptomatic anterior cruciate ligament injured patients, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 4, 4, pp. 217-224, (1996); Lephart, Scott M., Knee joint proprioception: A comparison between female intercollegiate gymnasts and controls, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 4, 2, pp. 121-124, (1996); Kobayashi, Atsushi, Muscle performance after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, International Orthopaedics, 28, 1, pp. 48-51, (2004)","M.-W.

The object of this study was to evaluate motor performance of the knee and determine the relationship of isokinetic test scores to scores on a variety of lower extremity functional tests. Methods: Ten healthy subjects and eleven ACLR patients at least six months after surgery performed the following: knee isokinetic tests at 60 and 180 deg/sec; three functional tests including leg vertical jump, single hop, and triple cross-over hop for distance. The International Knee Document Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDCSKEF) was used to score the self-assessment of each study participant. Paired T-test was used to compare the involved and uninvolved knee. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between the scores on the isokinetic test and functional tests. Significance was determined by P<0.05. Results: IKDCSKEF score was significantly lower in patients than control subjects. Quadriceps peak torque and functional test scores were significantly lower in the involved knee of the ACLR subjects compared to the uninvolved knee. Correlation coefficients of isokinetic peak torque to body weight and functional testing were not significant in patients or control subjects, whi1e the limb symmetry index (LSI) of the quadriceps isokinetics peak torque to body weight and the LSI of the functional tests were significant (r = 0.54 to 0.97). Conclusion: These results indicate a significant relationship between the LSI of various functional tests and the LSI of isokinetic testing among ACLR patients. Thus, in situations where an isokinetic dynamometer is not available, the LSI of functional tests can be used to estimate quadriceps deficiency for ACLR patients. © 2008, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

OMS103HP was evaluated in patients undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to assess the drug's safety and ability to improve postoperative knee function and motion, reduce postoperative pain, and allow earlier return to work. Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, randomized study. Allograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction patients in both treatment and vehicle control groups were monitored for safety and efficacy (e.g., measurements of knee function and motion, pain, and return to work) over a 30-day postoperative period. The efficacy endpoints of primary interest were assessed by use of both responder and time-to-event analyses. Results: There were statistically significant differences (P ≤ .05) between the OMS103HP and vehicle control groups in the endpoints of knee function (knee function composite and straight-leg raise component of knee function composite), range of motion (median number of days to maximum passive flexion of 90° or greater without pain and time to discontinuation of continuous passive motion), quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, successful pain management, and return to work. The overall incidences of adverse events and abnormal clinical laboratory values for both OMS103HP- and vehicle-treated subjects were similar, and none was attributed to OMS103HP. Conclusions: The clinical benefits of OMS103HP in this study were reduced postoperative pain; improved postoperative knee motion, quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, and knee function; and earlier return to work as measured by surgeons, nurses, and physical therapists across repeated clinic visits and rehabilitation sessions and recorded by patients in daily diaries. The drug was well tolerated.

It is not clear whether this potential reduction in muscle strength is progressive and related to the duration from the injury to ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible effect of the period from the injury to surgery on pre and postoperative outcomes of isokinetic muscle performance and laxity of knee in patients with anterior ACL deficiency. Patients and methods: Clinical and isokinetic assessments of 98 patients with ACL injury were evaluated preoperatively. Patients had appropriate surgical intervention with allograft achilles tendon, autograft quadriceps tendon and auto or allograft bone patellar tendon bone reconstructions. After surgery a standard rehabilitation program, accelerated rehabilitation protocol of Shelbourne, was programmed for patients. The time from the initial injury to surgery was determined and the patients were divided into groups according to the period from the injury to surgical intervention; group 1: surgery within 12 months and group 2: surgery more than 12 months. Group 2 was also subdivided into two groups group 2A: surgery within 12-36 months and group 2B: surgery more than 36 months from the injury. Also the postoperative outcomes of patients were assessed prospectively in the main groups as group 1 and 2. Isokinetic performance and KT- 1000 assessments were evaluated 1 week before and 2, 4, 6, 12 months after ACL reconstruction. All measurements were evaluated both in injured and uninjured legs and healthy legs were considered as controls. These differences between preoperative three groups were analyzed by performing one-way ANOVA and independent samples t test was used to compare the data between postoperative two groups. Results: 98 patients were included in our study. In arthrometer measurements, no significant difference was determined between groups except in KT 1000 tests between group 1 and group 2B preoperatively (p < 0.05). Also there was no significant difference between groups in flexion isokinetic performance. Preoperatively, in group 1, the difference between healthy and injured leg in extension measurements of peak torque, total work and endurance ratio was significantly lower than both group 2A and group B (p < 0.05). However preoperative analysis of group 2A and group 2B showed that these parameters did not differ significantly when surgery was performed within 12-36 months or more than 36 months from the injury. In the comparisons of groups postoperatively, lower values in these parameters on 2nd month and in endurance on 4th month remained significant after reconstruction in group 1 (p < 0.05). After 6 and 12 months, statistical significance did not remained between groups in spite of some higher deficits in lately operated patients. Conclusion: Reconstruction of ACL carried out within 12 months from the injury can minimize the strength deficit in isokinetic evaluations. Satisfactory results in isokinetic muscle performance can be achieved even with late reconstruction with appropriate rehabilitation involving especially quadriceps strengthening exercises. © 2008 IOS Press.

The quadriceps tendon was introduced as a substitute graft source for bone-patellar tendon-bone. We compared the clinical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions using central quadriceps tendon-patellar bone and bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts. We selected 72 patients who underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone between 1994 and 2001 and matched for age and gender with 72 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadriceps tendon-patellar bone. All patients were followed up for more than 2 years. We assessed anterior laxity, knee function using the Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores, and quadriceps strength, the means of which were similar in the two groups. More patients (28 or 39%) in the bone-patellar tendon-bone group reported anterior knee pain than in the quadriceps tendon-patellar bone group (six patients or 8.3%). Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the central quadriceps tendon-patellar bone graft showed clinical outcomes comparable to those of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the patellar tendon graft, with anterior knee pain being less frequent in the former. Our data suggest the quadriceps tendon can be a good alternative graft choice. Level of Evidence: Level III Therapeutic study.

Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Three hundred forty-five consecutive patients who were regular participants in International Knee Documentation Committee level I/II sports before injury and had an acute isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury from the practice of a single orthopaedic surgeon underwent a screening examination including clinical measures, knee laxity, quadriceps strength, hop testing, and patient self-reported knee function a mean of 6 weeks after injury when impairments were resolved. Independent t tests were performed to evaluate differences in quadriceps strength and anterior knee laxity between potential copers and noncopers. Hierarchical regression was performed to determine the influence of quadriceps strength, preinjury activity level, and anterior knee laxity on hop test performance, as well as the influence of timed hop, crossover hop, quadriceps strength, preinjury activity level, and anterior knee laxity on self-assessed global function. Results: Neither anterior knee laxity nor quadriceps strength differed between potential copers and noncopers. Quadriceps strength influenced hop test performance more significantly than did preinjury activity level or anterior knee laxity, but the variance accounted for by quadriceps strength was low (range, 4%-8%). Timed hop performance was the only variable that affected self-assessed global function. Conclusion: Traditional surgical decision making based on passive anterior knee laxity and preinjury activity level is not supported by the results, as neither is a good predictor of dynamic knee stability. A battery of clinical tests that capture neuromuscular adaptations, including the timed hop test, may be useful in predicting function and guiding individualized patient management after anterior cruciate ligament injury. © 2008 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Knee; Neuromuscular control; Quadriceps strength","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; demography; female; human; knee function; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; patient care; priority journal; screening test; self report; task performance; adolescent; algorithm; anterior cruciate ligament; classification; clinical trial; decision making; injury; joint instability; knee; knee injury; pathophysiology; physical examination; physiology; prospective study; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Physical Examination; Prospective Studies","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R37HD037985)","","Anderson, A.

Hypothesis: Clinical results after the implantation of a patellar bone quadriceps tendon autograft fixed with cross-pins or screws will show no significant difference between the 2 techniques with regard to stability, function, and subjective satisfaction. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Between 1998 and 2004, 193 patients with anterior cruciate ligament ruptures were implanted with a patellar bone quadriceps tendon autograft. For 100 of these patients, fixation was carried out using absorbable cross-pins, and for the remaining 93, fixation was carried out using absorbable screws. The results were evaluated by means of International Knee Documentation Committee, Noyes, and Lysholm scores, as well as KT-1000 arthrometer measurement and subjective satisfaction. Results: The mean follow-up postoperative control period was 29 months. In the International Knee Documentation Committee overall evaluation, the pin group showed a significantly better result (P =.03). The values of the Noyes score produced no significant differences. The mean value of the Lysholm score was 94 points in the screw group and 89 points in the pin group (P <.001). Overall, 90% of the patients subjectively judged their conditions as good or very good. Conclusion: With both operating processes examined, 80% to 90% of the cases achieved good to very good results. The use of cross-pins can be recommended for fixing patellar bone quadriceps tendon autografts. © 2007 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Autograft; Cross-pins; Operative care; Patellar bone quadriceps tendon; Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthrometry; article; biodegradable implant; comparative study; controlled study; female; follow up; fracture fixation; human; injury scale; intramedullary nailing; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; Noyes score; patella; patient satisfaction; postoperative period; priority journal; quadriceps tendon autograft; screw fixation; statistical significance; tendon graft; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthrometry, Articular; Bone Nails; Bone Screws; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Patellar Ligament; Patient Satisfaction; Recurrence","","","","","","","Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Antonogiannakis, Emmanouil M., Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadriceps tendon autograft and bioabsorbable cross-pin fixation, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 21, 7, pp. 894-894.e5, (2005); Brand, Jeff C., Graft fixation in cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 5, pp. 761-774, (2000); Breitfuss, H., The tendon defect after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the midthird patellar tendon-a problem for the patellofemoral joint?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 194-198, (1996); Dandy, David J., Patellar tendon length after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 76, 2, pp. 198-199, (1994); Ejerhed, Lars Erik, Patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?

Nevertheless, the problem of the typical donor-site-morbidity is unresolved. Recently, a transplant of quadriceps tendon, with an attached bone block (BQT) has been increasingly relied upon. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical results of a group of patients after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using either BPTB or quadriceps tendon autograft after a minimum follow-up of 2 years in terms of knee joint stability and function using both subjective and objective criteria. Retrospective study. A total of 260 patients with ACL ruptures were operated between 1995 and 2000; 124 received a BQT-autograft, including 8 revisions; 136 patients received a BPTB-autograft, exclusively primary interventions. The results were evaluated using the IKDC-, Noyes- and Lysholm-Scores. It was possible to re-evaluate 194 patients after a minimum follow-up period of 2 years, 64 of 260 patients (25%) were lost to follow-up. Ninety-seven percent of the operated knee joints in the BPTB-group were judged as normal or almost normal with the IKDC evaluation, as were 83% in the BQT-group (P ≤ 0.001). The BQT-group showed a significantly better result in the evaluation of the donor-site-morbidity. We found no significant differences in the functional outcome according to the Lysholm- and Noyes-Score. In comparison to the results after using a BQT-transplant for reconstruction of a ruptured ACL the use of the BPTB-transplant is in favour concerning patient satisfaction and IKDC evaluation. For patients with activities involving kneeling or prolonged flexion of the knee joint BQT-transplants can be a good alternative, however. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Acl rupture; Arthroscopy; Bone patellatendon bone; Bone quadriceps tendon; Reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; comparative study; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; patella ligament; pathophysiology; patient satisfaction; quadriceps femoris muscle; retrospective study; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Patient Satisfaction; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Breitfuss, H., The tendon defect after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the midthird patellar tendon-a problem for the patellofemoral joint?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 194-198, (1996); Chen, Chih Hwa, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft, Journal of Trauma - Injury, Infection and Critical Care, 46, 4, pp. 678-682, (1999); Dandy, David J., Patellar tendon length after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 76, 2, pp. 198-199, (1994); Ejerhed, Lars Erik, Patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?

Standardized isokinetic testing, a clinical evaluation and instrumented assessment of knee laxity were done. The findings showed no significant strength deficits between the patients in the BTB and Hamstring groups and the deficits were, in general, small. The quadriceps and hamstring muscle strengths were better in patients with a longer than shorter follow-up and stable knees had less knee flexion torque deficit than unstable knees. Strength deficit was associated with lower Lysholm knee scores. The findings of this study showed that the muscle strengths of the operated limb had a positive association with the functional outcome of the knee in the long-term and support the use of active rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","ACL; BTB; Extension torque; Flexion torque; Hamstring; HQ ratio","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical article; controlled study; follow up; functional status; hamstring; human; isokinetic exercise; joint laxity; Lysholm knee score; muscle graft; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; scoring system; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Finland; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Quadriceps Muscle; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Thigh","","","","","","","Anderson, Jayne L., Changes in muscle torque following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A comparison between hamstrings and patella tendon graft procedures on 45 patients, Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica, 73, 5, pp. 546-552, (2002); Aune, Arne Kristian, Four-strand hamstring tendon autograft compared with patellar tendon-bone autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomized study with two-year follow-up, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 722-728, (2001); Coombs, Rosalind, Knee flexor strength following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 8, pp. 618-622, (2001); Eriksson, Karl O., Semitendinosus muscle in anterior cruciate ligament surgery: Morphology and function, Arthroscopy, 17, 8, pp. 808-817, (2001); Giove, T.

Twenty-one non-copers with acute, isolated ACL injury ambulated at their intentional walking speed as kinetic, kinematic, and electromyographic (EMG) data were collected bilaterally. Lower extremity movement patterns and muscle activity were analyzed during the mid-stance and weight acceptance phases of stance. When compared to the uninjured limb, subjects exhibited lower sagittal plane knee excursions and peak knee angles, and higher muscle co-contraction on the injured limb. There was a lower knee flexion moment at peak knee extension, a trend for the knee contribution to the total support moment to be lower, and a higher ankle contribution to the total support moment on the injured limb. There were differences in the magnitude of muscle activity which included higher hamstring activity and lower soleus activity on the injured limb. Changes in quadriceps, soleus, and hamstring muscle activity on the injured limb were identified during weight acceptance that had not previously been reported, while hip compensation for a lower knee contribution to the total support moment has been described. Non-copers consistently stabilize their knee with a stiffening strategy involving less knee motion and higher muscle contraction. The variable combination of muscle adaptations that produce joint stiffness, and the ability of both the ankle and the hip to compensate for lower knee control indicate the non-coper neuromuscular system may be more malleable than previously believed. © 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Methods: We reviewed 137 arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions via quadriceps tendon autograft with a minimum of 2 years' follow-up. Clinical results were evaluated by use of the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, Lysholm score, and Cybex dynamometer (Lumex, Ronkonkoma, NY). Anterior tibial translation was measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA). Patients were classified into 3 groups based on postoperative pivot-shift and Lachman test findings: group I, both negative; group II, negative Lachman test and positive pivot shift; and group III, both positive. The radiographic analysis was performed via the angle between the tibial and femoral tunnels on plain anteroposterior radiographs, the angle between the tibial tunnel and anterior tibial cortex on the lateral view, and the femoral and tibial tunnel location by use of the ratio method. Postoperative knee MRI was performed, and the angle between the intercondylar anteroposterior axis and femoral tunnel on the axial view and the angle between the joint line and the graft on the oblique coronal and sagittal views were measured. Results: There were 100 patients in group I, 13 in group II, and 24 in group III. Patients in group I showed the greatest improvement in Lysholm score among the groups, and patients in group III had the greatest side-to-side difference by KT-1000 arthrometer. Tunnel obliquity as measured by the angle between the anteroposterior axis of the femur and the femoral tunnel in the axial view on MRI was greater (P < .05) and the angle between the joint line and the graft on the oblique coronal view was less in group I. Conclusions: This study showed a significantly lower Lysholm score and more vertical orientation of the femoral tunnel in the group with residual pivot shift than in the group without pivot shift. Vertical orientation of the femoral tunnel in the axial plane is closely related to residual pivot shift without definite anteroposterior laxity. More oblique positioning of the graft may have advantages in rotational stability, which in turn increase subjective patient satisfaction. Level of Evidence: Level III, diagnostic study of nonconsecutive patients without consistently applied reference gold standard. © 2007 Arthroscopy Association of North America.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Reconstruction; Residual pivot shift; Subjective satisfaction; Vertical orientation","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthrometry; article; clinical assessment; controlled study; dynamometry; female; femur; follow up; human; joint laxity; knee injury; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; postoperative care; quadriceps tendon autograft; retrospective study; statistical analysis; surgical approach; tendon graft; tibia; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Rotation; Rupture; Tendons; Tibia","","","","","(A040003)","Supported by a grant from the Korea Health 21 R&D Project, Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (A040003).

Accordingly, in order to study changes in knee motion pattern after an anterior cruciate ligament injury, the ideal is to compare the same leg prior to and after the injury. However, this is very seldom possible. The purpose of the present study was to describe changes in static and dynamic sagittal tibial translation, electromyographic activity and muscle torque relevant to an anterior cruciate ligament tear in one patient evaluated both before and after the injury. Methods: A male soccer player was examined 11 weeks before and eight weeks after an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Sagittal tibial translation was measured with the CA-4000 electrogoniometer; statically during Lachman's test, and dynamically during isokinetic muscle testing, one-legged squat and level walking. The electromyographic activity of mm. quadriceps and hamstrings, was registered simultaneously during the one-legged squat test. Findings: Static tibial translation was increased by ∼2 mm, while dynamic tibial translation was decreased by 0.4 mm at isokinetic testing, 0.9 mm at one-legged squat and 2.4 mm during level walking compared to before the injury. Muscle torque decreased 30% and 35% for the quadriceps and the hamstrings muscle, respectively. The electromyographic activity revealed similar activation levels in quadriceps and a doubled level of activation in hamstring compared to before the injury. Interpretation: In spite of an increase in static tibial translation eight weeks after an anterior cruciate ligament injury, the tibial translation decreased during activity, thus indicating that the patient could stiffen the knee in order to protect it against increased shear forces. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It was evaluated 20 male subjects (31.1 ± 7.45 years) with acl total rupture and 20 control subjects (22.2 ± 3.15 years). Electromyography, arthrometric kt 1000 and isokinetic dynamometry was used to evaluate the quadriceps and hamstrings EMG activity, passive and active ATT and isometric peak torque respectively during three maximum isometric voluntary contractions at 30 degrees of knee flexion. The results demonstrated that the passive and active ATT is significant greater in knees with acl rupture compared with the contralateral knees, dominant and non dominant knees of the control group. However the active ATT values were greater than the passive ATT. There is no statistic significant differences between groups concerning quadriceps and hamstring EMG activity and in the peak torque produced during the motor task requested. The results of this study demonstrated that individuals with acl rupture had similar behavior compared with normal knees in relation to isometric peak torque and motor control despite the different arthrokinematics of the tibiofemural joint observed in injured knees.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Electromyography; Exercise; Knee","","","","","","","","Bollen, Steven R., Advances in the management of anterior cruciate ligament injury, Current Orthopaedics, 14, 5, pp. 325-328, (2000); Fitzgerald, G.

Eccentric resistance training has the potential to induce considerable gains in muscle size and strength that could prove beneficial during postoperative rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of progressive eccentric exercise on thigh muscle structure following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods: Beginning three weeks after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, forty patients were randomly assigned to a program involving either twelve weeks of eccentric exercises or a standard rehabilitation protocol. Patients were matched by surgical procedure, sex, and age. The final series consisted of two cohorts of twenty patients each who had been treated with one of two types of graft (semitendinosus-gracilis or bone-patellar tendon-bone), with ten patients treated with each of the two rehabilitation protocols in each graft cohort. To evaluate changes in muscle structure, magnetic resonance images of the involved and uninvolved thighs were acquired before and after training. The volume and peak cross-sectional area of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gracilis and the distal portion of the gluteus maximus were calculated from these images. Results: The volume and peak cross-sectional area of the quadriceps and gluteus maximus, in both the involved and the uninvolved thighs and in the patients treated with each type of graft, improved significantly more in the eccentric-exercise group (p < 0.001). The magnitude of the volume change was more than twofold greater in that group. No significant differences in any hamstring or gracilis structural measurements were observed between the rehabilitation groups. However, the volume and peak cross-sectional area of the gracilis were markedly reduced, compared with the pretraining values, in the patients who had undergone reconstruction with the semitendinosus-gracilis graft. Conclusions: Eccentric resistance training implemented three weeks after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament can induce structural changes in the quadriceps and gluteus maximus that greatly exceed those achieved with a standard rehabilitation protocol. The success of this intervention can be attributed to the gradual and progressive exposure to negative work through eccentric exercise, ultimately leading to production of high muscle force.

Similar to other reported cases, the mechanism of injury involved forceful eccentric contraction of the quadriceps against a fixed foot. Superior displacement of the patella with a palpable defect of the patellar tendon, a positive Lachman test, and an inability to perform terminal knee extension noted during the on-field examination indicated the combined injury.

Changes in isometric muscle strength (MVC), voluntary activation and surface electromyogram (EMG) parameters were examined in relation to knee stability, pain and swelling in 31 patients (25 M, 6 F) mean (SD) 30(8) years. Physically inactive (RC) and sports participants (SC) acted as controls. Median frequency (Hz) and amplitude (mV) of rectus femoris using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 211 was calculated during 5-s isometric contractions at 100, 75, 50 and 25% of MVC. One month after surgery, a significant correlation (P < 0.01) was found between activation (%) and MVC of injured knee extensors. By 3 months, most patients were pain free and had achieved full activation but still had muscle weakness. At 1 and 3 months post-surgery and for all levels of MVC contraction, the median frequencies of the injured limbs were significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared to the SC group as were those of the RC group. There was a significant lowering of the median frequencies of the uninjured limbs compared to the SC group at 75 and 100% of MVC. The EMG amplitude of the uninjured and injured limbs mirrored those of the SC and RC groups, respectively. These results support the view that muscle activation patterns were altered following ACL injury and surgical repair and may contribute to subsequent changes in muscle fibre properties during detraining and subsequent retraining. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","ACLR; EMG; Median frequency; Motor unit recruitment; Muscle strength","adult; amplitude modulation; anterior cruciate ligament injury; article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; electromyogram; extensor muscle; female; Fourier transformation; frequency modulation; human; knee instability; knee pain; ligament surgery; male; monitoring; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; muscle weakness; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; swelling; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Case-Control Studies; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle Strength; Postoperative Complications","","","","","","","Arendt-Nielsen, Lars, Muscle fibre conduction velocity, mean power frequency, mean EMG voltage and force during submaximal fatiguing contractions of human quadriceps, European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology, 58, 1-2, pp. 20-25, (1988); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

Especially, the weakness of the quadriceps muscle has been ascribed to hamper daily physical tasks. The purpose of the present study was therefore to investigate if nutrient supplementation during 12 weeks of conservative rehabilitation strength training could enhance hypertrophy and strength of the quadriceps muscle in ACL-injured patients. Twenty-six ACL-injured men and women were included and randomly distributed into three supplementation groups: Protein+Carbohydrate (PC), Isocaloric-Carbohydrate (IC), or Placebo (PL), ingesting the supplementation immediately after each of 36 training sessions. Determined from images of thigh cross-sections (magnetic resonance imaging) the hypertrophy of the quadriceps muscle differed significantly between groups at the distal part, with the PC group demonstrating the largest hypertrophy. Peak torque of the quadriceps muscle at constant velocity 60° · s-1 was significantly elevated in the PC group only, and the time to reach peak torque tended to decrease as well only in the PC group. The results from this study demonstrate that restoration of the distal vasti muscle mass and knee extension muscle strength with resistance training is promoted further by protein-containing nutrient supplementation immediately after single exercise sessions. Thus, exercise-related protein supplementation may seem important for surgery-related rehabilitation of skeletal muscle. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Sixty-eight patients (33 males, 35 females), mean 12.5 years, were treated in four different centers from 1984 to 2001. Twenty-eight patients underwent the ACL-reconstruction with hamstring grafts, 16 patients with bone-patella-bone autografts, 12 patients with quadriceps grafts and 12 patients with facia lata. The mean follow-up was 32 months. Postoperative evaluation included radiographs, KT-1000/2000 stability measurements, Lysholm score, The Tegner activity scale and IKDC score. Neither leg length discrepancy nor angular deformities were noted. Mean KT-1000 difference was 2.1 mm, mean postoperative Lysholm knee score 93.3, IKDC 87% normal or nearly normal. The Tegner index decreased from 6.6 to 5.7. In total, six patients developed instability due to an adequate trauma 1 year after the index operation. Two patients showed mild arthrotic changes. All but two patients were able to return to the same level of preoperative sports participation. None of the four methods studied showed major differences in outcome compared to the other.

Ten participants, each with a previous history of unilateral ACL injury (median time post-injury 22 months) and eight healthy controls underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess excitability of the lower limb motor representation. Resting motor thresholds (RMTs) and stimulus response curves were measured at rest, while amplitude of motor evoked potentials and silent period duration were measured during active contraction. Correlations between these indices of excitability and three clinical measures of knee function were identified. Paired comparisons of indices by hemisphere revealed an asymmetry only in RMTs, which were significantly reduced on the side of injury in the ACL group. Correlations with clinical measures showed that the extent of quadriceps motor representation, as reflected by the steepness of SR curves, was strongly associated with quadriceps strength (r 2=0.71) on the injured side. The RMT asymmetry reported here in the context of ACL injury is consistent with other recent reports describing enhanced excitability of corticomotor projections targeting muscles adjacent to an immobilized or a painful joint. In such conditions, alterations in the quantity and quality of sensory feedback from the affected limb may underlie the rise in cortical excitability. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Knee; Motor cortex; Motor evoked potentials; Quadriceps; Transcranial magnetic stimulation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; case control study; evoked muscle response; female; Hoffmann reflex; human; injury; leg; male; motor cortex; muscle contraction; muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; skeletal muscle; transcranial magnetic stimulation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Case-Control Studies; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; H-Reflex; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Motor Cortex; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Acknowledgements Part of this work served as a partial fulfillment for a Master degree in Human Kinetics by M.

Participants: Fifty-four (27 male, 27 female) apparently healthy athletes and fifty-three (25 male, 28 female) non-athletes volunteered. Main outcome measures: The KT-1000 knee arthrometer quantified knee joint laxity during three passive drawer tests (66, 89, and 133 N); one active drawer test; and one maximum manual displacement test. The Biodex isokinetic dynamometer measured muscular strength during five maximal repetitions at 60°/s. Results: Non-athletes had significantly greater laxity compared to athletes on three of the variables. No significant differences were found between males and females in laxity. Athletes had significantly greater peak torque of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles as well as a greater hamstring to quadriceps (H:Q) ratio compared to non-athletes. Males produced significantly greater peak torque of the quadriceps and hamstrings compared to females. Conclusions: These findings suggest that laxity is related more to athletic participation than gender; therefore, knee joint laxity may not explain the higher incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in females. However, gender differences in peak torque suggest that strength may influence the higher knee injury incidence in female athletes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: 1 A total of 32 inpatients (19 males and 13 females) who signed informed consents and underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction at the Department of Knee Joint, Sichuan Provincial Orthopaedic Hospital were randomly divided into two groups (A, B) by single blind method, 16 patients in each. 2 In group A, the patients accepted TCM combining rehabilitation training. On the operation day, routine rehabilitation training was conducted in toes, ankle joint and quadriceps femoris contraction, continuously until post-operative half a year, and the intensity increased with the time extended. Between 8 hours and 7 weeks post-operative, TCM treatment was performed along with rehabilitation training: The patients administrated orally knee injury prescription 1# (coptis root, baikal skullcap root, dandelion, achyranthes root, common turmeric root and rhubarb), one preparation daily and three times taken, during 8 hours and 2-4 days post-operative. On post-operative 2 days, finger massage was done in Zusanli (ST 36), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6), 15 seconds for each acupoint, 10 minutes daily. On post-operative 3 days, the finger massage and electro-acupuncture (EA, 80 times per minute) was conducted alternatively in Zusanli (ST 36), Yinglingquan (GB 34) and Yinlingquan (SP 9). On post-operative 4 days, finger massage was performed in Zusanli (ST 36), Yanglingquan (GB 34), Yinlingquan (SP 9), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Chengshan (BL 57) along with the same EA treatment as above. During the post-operative 5-11 days, the patients administrated orally knee injury prescription 2# (peach seed, Chinese angelica, red peony root, medicinal cyathula root, akebia stem, teasel root, common bletilla tuber, nutgrass galingale rhizome and coptis root), one preparation taken by three times daily, continuously for 7 days, meanwhile the finger massage and EA treatment was done same as above. From the post-operative 12 days, the patients administrated orally knee injury prescription 2# (membranous milkvetch root, tangshen, earth-worm, akabia stem, desertliving cistanche, dodder seed, Chinese taxillue twig, obscured homalomena rhizome and flowering quince fruit), one preparation taken by three times daily. Meanwhile the finger massage and EA treatment was done same as above. At post-operative 4-7 weeks, TCM was given symptomatically combining with finger massage. At post-operative 8-12 weeks, exercise muscle power was strengthened. During post-operative 12 weeks and 6 months, all the functions recovered. In group B: The patients accepted only rehabilitation training after operation, identically as above. 3 At pre-operation, and 3, 7, 14 days and 3 months after operation, the pain at rest and activity were evaluated quantifiedly by visual analogue scale (VAS), indolent as 0 and server painful as 10.0. 4 At post-operative 3, 4 and 17 days, the swelling was detected with knee joint cavity puncture and fluid extracts. 5 At pre-operation, and post-operative 7, 14 days and 3 months, the range of motion (ROM) was measured with joint angle finder. At pre-operation and 3 months after operation, knee joint function was assayed with Lysholm scale by interrogative mode (totally 100 scores, and the higher score indicated the better knee function). 6 The symptom, knee joint function and motor function of patients were detected with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)-2000 scale (integral score method, 1 on behalf of minimum level of function or most severe symptom, and the higher score implied the better function and the slighter symptom). 7 The difference of measurement data were compared with t test. Results: Totally 32 patients of ACL reconstruction were involved into the result analysis. 1 At post-operative 3 and 7 days, the pain levels of patients at rest and activity in group A were obviously lower than group B (P < 0.05), especially at post-operative 14 days, the pain at activity obviously decreased (P < 0.05). 2 At post-operative 7 days and 3 months, ROM in group A was prior to that of group B (P < 0.05). 3 The difference of the knee swelling at the 3, 7 and 14 days after operation was not significant between two groups (P > 0.05). 4 The scores of knee joint function were markedly higher at 3 months after operation than at pre-operation, and also markedly higher in group A than in group B (P < 0.05), 5 There was insignificant difference in the scores of IKDC-2000 scale between two groups at pre-operation and post-operative 3 months (P > 0.05). Conclusion: After ACL reconstruction, early TCM combing rehabilitation training can relieve the postoperative pain and swelling of patients, and improve the function of knee joint, with the prior effect compared with single rehabilitation training.","","Achyranthes extract; akabia extract; akeiba extract; Angelica extract; baikal skullcap extract; bletilla extract; Cistanche extract; Coptis extract; Cuscuta extract; cyathula extract; dandelion extract; Homalomena extract; membranous milkvetch extract; nutgrass galingale extract; Paeonia radix; peach extract; plant extract; plant medicinal product; quince extract; rhubarb extract; tangshen; taxillue extract; teasel extract; turmeric; unclassified drug; adult; akabia; akeiba; ankle; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthrocentesis; arthroscopic surgery; article; baikal skullcap; bletilla; China; Chinese medicine; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; Cuscuta; cyathula; disease severity; drug dose regimen; earthworm; edema; electroacupuncture; female; Homalomena; hospital; human; informed consent; kinesiotherapy; knee arthroplasty; knee function; leg movement; male; massage; medicinal plant; membranous milkvetch; muscle contraction; muscle function; muscle strength; muscle training; nutgrass galingale; outcome assessment; postoperative care; postoperative pain; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; puncture; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; rest; single blind procedure; synovial fluid; taxillue; teasel; therapy effect; toe; visual analog scale","","turmeric, 8024-37-1","","","","","undefined, (2001); undefined, (2001); undefined, (2003); undefined, (2004); undefined, (2004); undefined, (2000); Clin J Pain, (1987); Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993); Irrgang, James J., Development and validation of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 5, pp. 600-613, (2001)","","","","","","","","","16715926","","ZLKHA","","Chinese","Chin.

The most effective age at which to start these programs is not known. Hypothesis:Age and gender affect ligament laxity and quadriceps-to-hamstring strength ratio. Study Design:Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods:Fifty-three female and 70 male recreational soccer players, 10 to 18 years of age, were studied with physical examination, KT-1000 arthrometry, and manual maximum quadriceps and hamstring strength using a handheld dynamometer. The subjects were separated into 4 groups to examine maturity-related intergender differences: group G1, premenarchal girls (n = 24); group B1, boys 13 years and younger (n = 38); group G2, girls 2 or more years after menarche (n = 29); and group B2, boys 14 years and older (n = 32). Results:Both knees of 123 soccer players were evaluated. The mean ages for groups G1, B1, G2, and B2 were 11.50 ± 1.69, 10.63 ± 1.85, 15.5 ± 1.43, and 15.59 ± 1.24 years, respectively, and the mean laxity measurements were 8.84 ± 2.12, 8.51 ± 1.61, 8.85 ± 1.86, and 7.33 ± 1.27 mm, respectively. Laxity was significantly less for the mature boys (P=.0015) than for the immature boys, mature girls, and immature girls. With increasing maturity, significant increases in both quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength were observed for both boys and girls (P<.05). Boys demonstrated a greater percentage increase in hamstring strength with maturity (179%) compared with girls (27%) (P<.05). Mature girls (2.06) had significantly greater quadriceps-tohamstring ratio when compared with immature girls (1.74), immature boys (1.58), and mature boys (1.48) (P<.05). Conclusion:Female athletes after menarche increase their quadriceps strength greater than their hamstring strength, putting them at risk for anterior cruciate ligament injury. Anterior cruciate ligament-prevention programs based on improving dynamic control of the knee by emphasizing hamstring strengthening should be instituted for girls after menarche. © 2006 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","ACL; Gender; Maturity; Muscle strength","adolescent; adult; age distribution; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthrometry; article; athlete; clinical examination; controlled study; dynamometry; evaluation; female; hamstring; human; major clinical study; male; menarche; muscle strength; physical examination; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; school child; sex ratio; Adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Child; Compressive Strength; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; New York City; Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Sports; Tensile Strength; Thigh","","","","","","","Aagaard, Per, Antagonist muscle coactivation during isokinetic knee extension, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 10, 2, pp. 58-67, (2000); Aagaard, Per, Isokinetic muscle strength and capacity for muscular knee joint stabilization in elite sailors, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 7, pp. 521-525, (1997); Aagaard, Per, A new concept for isokinetic hamstring: Quadriceps muscle strength ratio, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 26, 2, pp. 231-237, (1998); Anderson, Allen F., Correlation of anthropometric measurements, strength, anterior cruciate ligament size, and intercondylar notch characteristics to sex differences in anterior cruciate ligament tear rates, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 1, pp. 58-66, (2001); Baratta, Richard V., Muscular coactivation.

Cine phase contrast dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, in combination with a model-based tracking algorithm developed by the authors, was used to measure tibiofemoral kinematics as the subjects performed the active, supine posture knee extension exercise in the terminal 30 degrees of motion. Two determinants of tibiofemoral motion were measured: anterior/posterior location of the tibia relative to the femur, and axial rotation of the tibia relative to the femur. We hypothesized that more anterior tibial positioning, as well as differences in axial tibial rotation patterns, would be observed in ACL-deficient (ACL-D) knees when compared to uninjured knees. Multifactor ANOVA analyses were used to determine the dependence of the kinematic variables on (i) side (injured vs. uninjured, matched by subject in the control group), (ii) flexion angle measured at five-degree increments, and (iii) subject group (ACL-injured vs. control). Statistically significant anterior translation and external tibial rotation (screw home motion) accompanying knee extension were found. The ACL-D knees of the injured group exhibited significantly more anterior tibial positioning than the uninjured knees of these subjects (average difference over extension range = 3.4 ± 2.8 mm, p < 0.01 at all angles compared), as well as the matched knees of the control subjects. There was a significant effect of interaction between side and subject group on A/P tibial position. We did not find significant differences in external tibial rotation associated with ACL deficiency. The changes to active joint kinematics documented in this entirely noninvasive study may contribute to cartilage degradation in ACL-D knees, and encourage more extensive investigations using similar methodology in the future. © 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.","ACL; Cine phase contrast; Kinematics; Knee; Magnetic resonance","adult; algorithm; analysis of variance; anterior cruciate ligament injury; article; cartilage degeneration; clinical article; controlled study; exercise; female; femur; human; joint function; kinematics; knee; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; statistical significance; tibia; anterior cruciate ligament; biomechanics; comparative study; injury; joint characteristics and functions; methodology; pathophysiology; torsion; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Female; Femur; Humans; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Tibia; Torsion","","","","","","","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Maletius, Wolfgang, Eighteen- to twenty-four-year follow-up after complete rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 6, pp. 711-717, (1999); Herzog, Walter L., Resultant and local loading in models of joint disease, Arthritis Care and Research, 49, 2, pp. 239-247, (2003); Grood, Edward S., Biomechanics of the knee-extension exercise.

The physiotherapist and the patient assess independently and simultaneously the patient's performance. The TAK comprises eight demanding functional activities with emphasis on strength, stability, springiness and endurance. Objectives: To evaluate the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of TAK between the physiotherapist's and the patient's assessments. Further, to evaluate the relation between the functional tests in TAK and the isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength. Materials and methods: Fifty-nine subjects were included in the study. Thirty-one were anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructed, fourteen were ACL-injured not reconstructed and fourteen were healthy athletes. The inter-rater-reliability was evaluated by assessments of 59 subjects carried out by two independent physiotherapists using visual observation. The assessment was rated on a 0-10-point scale according to five elaborate criteria drawn up for each test. Simultaneously, the subjects were asked to rate their own performance on each test using a 0-10-point scale. The intra-rater-reliability of TAK was evaluated by a test-retest of 31 patients. The relation between the physiotherapist's and the patients' ratings as well as of the patients' ratings at two different occasions were evaluated. Isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength was measured in a Biodex dynamometer on all 59 subjects in order to study the relation between quadriceps muscle strength and the results of the functional tests in TAK. Results: Inter-rater-reliability showed good consistency between the assessments of the two physiotherapists in seven of eight tests (κ = 0.62-0.78). The intra-rater-reliability was moderate to good (κ = 0.43-0.65) in the test-retest study. The consistency of the physiotherapist and the patients' assessments differed, but showed good correlation. The consistency of the test-retest study of the patients' assessment was low. The correlation between the isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength measured in a Biodex dynamometer and the results of the functional tests was moderate in this study. Conclusions: This criterion-based test method for athletes with knee injuries showed good inter-rater reliability and acceptable intra-rater reliability for the physiotherapists' assessment. The consistency of the patients' ratings was low. The correlation between isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength and functional tests in TAK was moderate. The validity has not been evaluated in this study but will be done in the future. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Anterior cruciate ligaments; Knee injuries; Outcome assessment; Rehabilitation; Reproducibility of results","adolescent; adult; article; endurance; exercise test; female; human; joint instability; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; physiotherapy; reproducibility; self evaluation; skeletal muscle; sport injury; Adolescent; Adult; Athletic Injuries; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Physical Endurance; Physical Therapy Modalities; Reproducibility of Results; Self Assessment (Psychology)","","","","","","","Practical Statistics for Medical Research, (1991); Kinetic Chain Weight Training Strength Assessment and Functional Preformance Testing, (2003); Barber, Sue D., Quantitative assessment of functional limitations in normal and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 255, pp. 204-214, (1990); Barber-Westin, Sue D., Rigorous statistical reliability, validity, and responsiveness testing of the cincinnati knee rating system in 350 subjects with uninjured, injured, or anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knees, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 4, pp. 402-416, (1999); Bengtsson, J., A study for testing the sensitivity and reliability of the Lysholm knee scoring scale, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 4, 1, pp. 27-31, (1996); Biodex Application Manual, (1986); Martin Bland, J., STATISTICAL METHODS FOR ASSESSING AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO METHODS OF CLINICAL MEASUREMENT, The Lancet, 327, 8476, pp. 307-310, (1986); Bollen, Steven R., A comparison of the Lysholm and Cincinnati knee scoring questionnaires, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 2, pp. 189-190, (1991); Brosky, Joseph A., Intrarater reliability of selected clinical outcome measures following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 29, 1, pp. 39-48, (1999); Contemp Orthop, (1982)","K.

Hypothesis: Anterior cruciate ligament strain will correlate with impact force, quadriceps force, and knee flexion angle. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Eleven cadaveric knees (age, 70.8 [19.3] years; 5 male; 6 female) were mounted in a custom fixture with the tibia and femur secured to a triaxial load cell. Quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscle forces were simulated using pretensioned steel cables (stiffness, 7 kN/cm), and the quadriceps tendon force was measured using a load cell. Mean strain on the anteromedial bundle of the anterior cruciate ligament was measured using a DVRT. With the knee in 25° of flexion, the construct was vertically loaded by an impact force initially directed 4 cm posterior to the knee joint center. Tibiofemoral kinematics was measured using a 3D optoelectronic tracking system. Results: The increase in anterior cruciate ligament relative strain was proportional to the increase in quadriceps force (r2 = 0.74; P < .00001) and knee flexion angle (r2 = 0.88; P < .00001) but was not correlated with the impact force (r2 = 0.009; P = .08). Conclusion: The increase in knee flexion and quadriceps force during this simulated 1-footed landing strongly influenced the relative strain on the anteromedial bundle of the anterior cruciate ligament. Clinical Relevance: These results suggest that even in the presence of knee flexor muscle forces, the increase in quadriceps force required to prevent the knee from flexing during landing can place the anterior cruciate ligament at risk for large strains. © 2006 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomechanics; Jump landing; Knee; Ligament; Quadriceps; Strain","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; cadaver; clinical article; female; flexor muscle; gastrocnemius muscle; hamstring; human; human tissue; in vitro study; jumping; knee function; male; muscle force; physical stress; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; simulation; stress strain relationship; knee; mechanical stress; middle aged; physiology; weight bearing; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Cadaver; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Quadriceps Muscle; Stress, Mechanical; Weight-Bearing","","","","","","","Berns, Gregory S., Strain in the anteromedial bundle of the anterior cruciate ligament under combination loading, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 10, 2, pp. 167-176, (1992); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior cruciate ligament strain in-vivo: A review of previous work, Journal of Biomechanics, 31, 6, pp. 519-525, (1998); Beynnon, Bruce D., The measurement of anterior cruciate ligament strain in vivo, International Orthopaedics, 16, 1, pp. 1-12, (1992); Blanpied, Peter R., The difference in stiffness of the active plantarflexors between young and elderly human females, Journals of Gerontology, 48, 2, pp. M58-M63, (1993); DeMorat, Gene J., Aggressive Quadriceps Loading Can Induce Noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 32, 2, pp. 477-483, (2004); Experimental Simulation of Mechanism of Injury for Noncontact Isolated Anterior Cruciate Ligament Ruptures, (1998); Dufek, Janet S., Biomechanical Factors Associated with Injury During Landing in Jump Sports, Sports Medicine, 12, 5, pp. 326-337, (1991); Draganich, Louis F., Interaction between intrinsic knee mechanics and the knee extensor mechanism, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 5, 4, pp. 539-547, (1987); Draganich, Louis F., An in vitro study of anterior cruciate ligament strain induced by quadriceps and hamstrings forces, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 8, 1, pp. 57-63, (1990); Durselen, Lutz, The Influence of Muscle Forces and External Loads on Cruciate Ligament Strain, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 129-136, (1995)","T.J.

Whether a lateral tenodesis should be associated with the intra-articular reconstruction and the appropriate time between the accident and the repair remain two topics of debate. We present results obtained in a consecutive series of 50 pivoting sport atheletes reviewed retrospectively. These patients had been treated within eight days of trauma with a modified MacIntosh technique using an iliotibial band. This technique enables lateral tenodesis and reconstruction of the central pivot with only one harvesting site. We searched for responses to two questions: are our results comparable to those in other published series? could this operation be warranted as an emergency procedure? Material and methods: Fifty patients from a consecutive retrospective series of 62 patients (eight lost to follow-up and four excluded from the analysis) were reviewed by an independent observer at mean follow-up of 5.2 years (range 54.4 to 86.4 months). The ARPEGE and IKDC scoring systems were used. An isokinetic assessment was obtained in 38 patients at one year. The reconstruction technique used an iliotibial band measuring 40-45 mm in width. The lateral reconstruction consisted in section then translation of the lateral intermuscular partition. Results: The overall outcome was scored as follows: IKDC A 38%, B 46%, C 12%, D 4%. Mean residual differential laxity (KT 1000) was 1.86±1.74 assessed manually with a negative Lachman in 48% of knees. 88% of the positive tests had been neutralized. Early anatomic failure was noted in two knees with recurrent traumatic tears at 25 and 38 months. Using the ARPEGE scoring system, outcome was excellent in 38%, good in 46%, fair in 12% and poor in 4%. At last follow-up, the level of sports activities was unchanged in 33 patients. Irreducible flexion measuring more than 5° was noted in two patients, and a deficit in flexion greater than 20° in three. One female athlete who had resumed her former sports level presented mobilization under narcosis. None of the patients complained of pain at the harvesting site. There was one case of muscle herniation proximally by wound dehiscence. Mean residual deficit of the quadriceps, measured at twelve months, was 10% at 90°/s; mean residual deficit of the hamstrings at the same speed was 1.3%. Discussion: Our overall results as measured with the IKDC scoring system were comparable with those observed in series using other autologous transplants. The risk of stiffness is greater with early reconstruction, suggesting emergency repair should be considered with caution. Recovery of muscle force demonstrates one of the advantages of using the iliotibial band which does not injure the extensor-flexor system of the knee joint. The fact that none of the patients complained of pain at the harvesting site is a favorable element for rehabilitation and resumed sports activities. © 2006. Elsevier Masson SAS.

Sixty-three patients (39 men) with a mean age of 30.3 years (range 19-42) who underwent an ACL reconstruction between 1990-1992 participated in the study. Quadriceps and hamstring isometric and isokinetic strength as well as one-leg hop test for distance were measured preoperatively and six months 1, 2, 3 and 10 years postoperatively. The injured leg was significantly weaker than the non-injured leg in knee extension strength on all test occasions and in knee flexion strength except at ten years. There was a strong correlation between the muscle strength tests at different speeds. The one leg hop for distance showed significant differences between the injured and non-injured leg on all test occasions. A moderate to high correlation was observed between muscle strength and jumping ability with higher values for the non-injured leg. In our study we found a persisting weakness in the quadriceps as well as jumping ability during ten years. This is an indication that it is hard to recover the preoperative functional level after an ACL reconstruction. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

Management practices have varied. One-stage reconstruction of both ligaments using arthroscopically implanted allografts was proposed starting in 1996 for such chronic laxity but only 44 cases have been reported in six papers mixed in with recent cases raising very different problems. Treatments using allografts or autogenous grafts or both implanted arthroscopically have often been combined with open surgery. We report a retrospective analysis of 25 knees treated with the same technique from 1983 to 2004: reconstruction with a single transplant taken from the extensor system. Material and methods: A 30-cm lenght patella tendon-patella-quadriceps tendon graft was harvested. The patellar block was fixed in a hole drilled under the tibial spine, the patellar tendon replacing the posterior cruciate ligament and the quadriceps tendon passing through the lateral condyle and replacing the anterior cruciate ligament before implantation on Gerdy's tubercle, this also creating an extra-articular plasty with the same implant. Medial, lateral and posterior plasties were performed, depending on the radiographic assessment of laxity. Twenty-five knees with major laxity and instability were operated on, including 14 in two-stage operations. The differential anterior drawer was 10±3 mm medially and 9±5 mm laterally. The posterior drawer at 70° was 15±4 mm medially and 10±6 degrees laterally. The total anteroposterior laxity of the medial compartment was 29 mm, it was 30 mm for the lateral compartment. Lateral laxity was considered major (≥10°) in 17 knees and medial laxity in 7. Lateral and medial laxities were associated in eleven knees. Hyper-extension was very severe in five knees. Results: Functional outcome at mean 6.5 years follow-up (range 1-21) was satisfactory (except in three knees) allowing renewed occupational activity. Resumption of sports activity was less marked and none of the knees was in IKDC class A, corroborating results in the literature. Anatomic outcome was assessed on the radiological drawer decrease which was modest, mean gain in the anterior drawer measuring 4 and 5 mm in the medial and lateral compartments and mean gain in the posterior drawer measuring 5 mm medially and 3 mm laterally. Peripheral laxity was corrected for best. Discussion: Classically, one or other of the cruciate ligaments is repaired, sometimes both, but in a two-stage procedure associating two different methods and autogenous tendon grafts. One-stage reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments with a single autogenous graft and a wide approach has not led to any complications. One-stage reconstruction using this technique has several advantages: one anterior incision, single transplant which also enables lateral plasty, short immobilization time with rapid rehabilitation. © 2006.

We hypothesized that the weakness would not recover to the level of healthy control subjects without structured rehabilitation. Secondarily, we asked whether quadriceps and hamstrings side-to-side percent asymmetry in strength was consistent at different stages of chronicity. Thirty-six male amateur athletes forming equal groups of short, intermediate, and long chronicity (mean, 4, 12, and 56 months, respectively) were tested isokinetically against control subjects at 60° per second. Weakness was substantial in both muscle groups and at all times ranging from 32% to 21% compared with the control subjects. However, side-to-side deficits revealed a linear trend of lessening with time. The quadriceps had greater side-to-side asymmetry that ranged from 23% to 10%, whereas the hamstrings asymmetry ranged from 14% to almost 0%. Acquiring symmetric strength earlier than 1 year after injury only occurred in the hamstrings. It can be inferred that participation in organized rehabilitation would minimize the detrimental effects of anterior cruciate ligament rupture on thigh muscle strength. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; article; athlete; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; hamstring; human; joint function; male; muscle weakness; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; sporting event; anterior cruciate ligament; injury; knee injury; pathophysiology; retrospective study; rupture; skeletal muscle; sport injury; thigh; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Retrospective Studies; Rupture; Thigh","","","","","","","J Am Acad Orthop Surg, (1994); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Dynamics of pathological motion: Applied to the anterior cruciate deficient knee, Journal of Biomechanics, 23, SUPPL. 1, pp. 99-105, (1990); Benjuya, Nissim, Isokinetic profile of patient with anterior cruciate ligament tear, Isokinetics and Exercise Science, 8, 4, pp. 229-232, (2000); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain Behavior During Rehabilitation Exercises In Vivo, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 24-34, (1995); Bolgla, Lori A., Reliability of lower extremity functional performance tests, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 26, 3, pp. 138-142, (1997); Bonamo, John J., The conservative treatment of the anterior cruciate deficient knee, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 6, pp. 618-623, (1990); Clinical Orthopaedic Rehabilitation, (1996); Chmielewski, Terese L., Changes in weight-bearing following injury or surgical reconstruction of the ACL: Relationship to quadriceps strength and function, Gait and Posture, 16, 1, pp. 87-95, (2002); Advances in Motor Learning and Control, (1996)","A.D.

Objectives: To present a progressively increasing negative-work exercise program via eccentric ergometry early after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) and to suggest the potential of negative work to amplify the return of quadriceps size and strength. Case Description: The patient was a 26-year-old highly active recreational athlete who sustained an ACL tear while skiing in January 2004 and then again while skiing in February 2005. This individual underwent an arthroscopically assisted ACL-R with a double-loop semitendinosus-gracilis autograft initially, then a patellar tendon autograft following his ACL graft rupture. Beginning within 3 weeks after surgery, a progressive negative-work exercise program was initiated using an eccentric ergometer. The patient completed 31 training sessions of 5 to 30 minutes in duration over a 12-week period following the ACL-R and 33 training sessions of the same frequency and duration following the ACL revision. Outcomes: Following ACL-R, quadriceps volume increased 28% (involved lower extremity) and 14% (uninvolved lower extremity) during the 12-week training program. Following revision, quadriceps volume returned to similar levels at the same postoperative period as those achieved after the initial surgery (2% less on the involved side and 2% greater on the uninvolved side). Quadriceps strength, 15 weeks after ACL-R, exceeded preoperative measures by an average of 20% (involved) and 14% (uninvolved). Quadriceps strength after ACL revision exceeded all previous measures. Discussion: This case report suggests that if gradually and progressively applied, negative work via eccentric ergometry can be both safe and efficacious early after ACL-R. Eccentric exercise may mitigate the prevalent muscle size and strength deficits commonly observed after ACL-R. The results of this case suggest a need for continued research with early negative work interventions following ACL-R.","ACL; Knee; Muscle physiology; Skiing","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; case report; eccentric ergometry; ergometry; exercise; gracilis muscle; human; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; male; muscle graft; muscle mass; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; semitendinous muscle","","","","","","","Arangio, George A., Thigh muscle size and strength after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and rehabilitation, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 26, 5, pp. 238-243, (1997); Techniques in Knee Surgery, (2001); Barber, Sue D., Quantitative assessment of functional limitations in normal and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 255, pp. 204-214, (1990); Bigland-Ritchie, Brenda R., Integrated electromyogram and oxygen uptake during positive and negative work., The Journal of Physiology, 260, 2, pp. 267-277, (1976); Ejerhed, Lars Erik, Patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?

The central quadriceps tendon autograft is an alternative to bone-patellar tendon-bone and free hamstring autografts. The purpose of this study was to measure the postharvest reduction in quadriceps extensor mechanism strength when a central quadriceps free tendon graft is removed. The strength deficit was compared with that associated with harvesting a central free patellar tendon graft, excluding the effects of harvesting bone blocks. Type of Study: Experimental laboratory study. Methods: Fourteen knee extensor mechanisms were divided into quadriceps and patellar tendon constructs. Constructs were tested to failure in tension in either the intact state or after removing 10-mm wide central free tendon grafts. Failure strengths of the quadriceps and patellar tendon constructs were compared statistically using paired and unpaired t tests. Results: The average strength (±SD) measured for the native quadriceps tendon was 3,660 ± 830 N, decreasing to 2,430 ± 680 N after removing a partial-thickness 10-mm wide central free graft. The average strength measured for the native patellar tendon was 1,920 ± 330 N, decreasing to 1,460 ± 740 N after removing a 10-mm wide central free graft. Conclusions: The tensile strength of the quadriceps tendon is reduced by approximately one third after harvesting a partial-thickness 10-mm wide central free tendon graft. This postharvest strength of the quadriceps tendon is higher than that of the intact patellar tendon. Clinical Relevance: Surgeons can be assured that harvest of a central quadriceps free tendon graft leaves a stronger extensor mechanism than harvest of a patellar tendon graft. © 2006 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Central quadriceps free tendon graft; Patellar tendon; Quadriceps mechanism strength; Quadriceps tendon","adult; article; controlled study; extensor muscle; free tissue graft; human; human tissue; knee function; muscle strength; muscle tone; patella tendon; postoperative period; quadriceps femoris muscle; Student t test; surgical technique; tendon; tendon graft; tensile strength; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Patella; Tendon Transfer; Tendons; Tensile Strength; Tissue and Organ Harvesting; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","Supported by the Greater Hartford Orthopaedic Education and Research Foundation and the University of Connecticut Health Center.","Marshall, John L., The anterior cruciate ligament: A technique of repair and reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, No. 143, pp. 97-106, (1979); Kornblatt, Ira, Long-term followup of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the quadriceps tendon substitution for chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 16, 5, pp. 444-448, (1988); Howe, James G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadriceps patellar tendon graft.

Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial. Setting: University clinic. Patients: Ninety-five patients (18-50 years old) with an acute ACL tear were included in the present study. The subjects were randomized to either brace group, treated with functional bracing from the first testing session (<5 weeks postinjury) to 12 weeks postinjury or a control group, treated without bracing. The patients were followed for 6 months. Twenty-one subjects were excluded due to the following exclusion criteria: partial rupture or articular cartilage injury shown on MRI or with arthroscopy, or other injuries that negatively affected rehabilitation, or dropped out due to surgery (n = 22), or personal reasons (n = 10). Forty-two patients remained in the study, 22 in the brace group and 20 in the control group. Outcome Measurements: Visual analogue scale, Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Cincinnati knee score, a brace evaluation form, and muscle peak torque. Results: When using the brace the subjects in the brace group experienced less (P = 0.047) sense of instability, evaluated with visual analogue scale, than the control group. However, bracing had no effect on any of the variables in Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score or Cincinnati knee score and no effect on quadriceps or hamstring muscle peak torque. Subjectively, the brace group experienced a positive effect of the brace on rehabilitation. Conclusions: Nonoperated acute ACL-deficient patients experienced a positive effect of the brace regarding sense of instability and rehabilitation. However, these findings were not supported by objective outcomes.

Hypothesis: There will be no difference in the effectiveness of a home-based rehabilitation program and a standard physical therapy-supervised rehabilitation program in patients 3 months after nonacute anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: There were 145 patients (16-59 years) who attended a presurgery education class. Home-based patients attended 4 physical therapy sessions, and physical therapy-supervised patients attended 17 physical therapy sessions over the first 12 weeks after surgery. All patients followed the same standardized rehabilitation program. Study outcome measures included active-assisted knee flexion and passive knee extension range of motion, knee range of motion during walking, KT computerized arthrometer results, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings strength. Patient outcomes were dichotomized as either clinically acceptable or unacceptable. Rehabilitation programs were compared by the proportion of acceptable patients in each group. Results: The home-based group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with acceptable flexion and extension range of motion compared to the standard physical therapy group (flexion, 67% vs 47%; extension, 97% vs 83%). There were no significant differences between the groups in range of motion during walking, ligament laxity, and strength. Conclusion: A structured, minimally supervised rehabilitation program was more effective in achieving acceptable knee range of motion in the first 3 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than a standard physical therapy-based program. Clinical Relevance: Recreational athletes undergoing nonacute anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction can successfully reach acceptable rehabilitation goals in the first 3 months after surgery with a limited number of purposeful physical therapy education sessions, allowing recreational athletes more flexibility when integrating the necessary postoperative rehabilitation into their daily activities. © 2005 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Cost effectiveness; Rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; hamstring; health care policy; home care; human; intermethod comparison; isokinetic exercise; joint function; joint mobility; knee function; major clinical study; male; outcomes research; patient education; physiotherapy; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; recreation; single blind procedure; standardization; statistical significance; walking; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Exercise Therapy; Female; Gait; Home Care Services, Hospital-Based; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Rupture; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Ageberg, Eva, Influence of supervised and nonsupervised training on postural control after an acute anterior cruciate ligament rupture: A three-year longitudinal prospective study, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 31, 11, pp. 632-644, (2001); Beard, David John, Home or supervised rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomized controlled trial, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 27, 2, pp. 134-143, (1998); Beard, David John, Gait and electromyographic analysis of anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects, Gait and Posture, 4, 2, pp. 83-88, (1996); Boone, D.

The purpose was to analyze passive and dynamic tibial translation before, during and after a specific exercise session, including cycling and a maximum number of knee extensions and heel-raises, in healthy individuals. Passive and dynamic sagittal tibial translation was measured on 18 healthy individuals (nine men and nine women) before, during and after a specific exercise session with heavy load, including cycling and maximum number of knee extensions and heel-raises. Sagittal tibial translation during the Lachman test, maximal isometric quadriceps contraction, one-legged squat and gait was registered with the CA-4000 electrogoniometer. The electromyographic (EMG) activity of m. vastus medialis and lateralis, m. gastrocnemius and mm. hamstrings was registered. There was no difference in passive or dynamic sagittal tibial translation during or after the exercise session. No difference could be detected in EMG activity during squat after compared with before the exercise session. In conclusion, the knee exercises did not influence the amount of translation in healthy individuals. The findings indicate that isolated strength training of quadriceps may be included in anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation programs, even if further specific studies on injured individuals most be performed.

Objective: To evaluate the functional outcomes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a free fascia lata graft strengthened by gracilis tendon. Methods: 60 patients met the inclusion criteria (age over 16, minimum 1 year follow-up). The isokinetic test on Cybex II consist of a concentric evaluation at 60°/s, 180°/s and 240°/s and an eccentric one at 30°/s. A Satisfaction index, Lysholm-Tegner score and IKDC score completed the evaluation. Results: 55 patients were examined (91.6%), mean age 31 years, 69% of men and a mean follow up of 30 months; only 50 had isokinetic test. 81.8% were really/very satisfied. Mean Lysholm knee score is 96/100 with 93% of excellent and good results; mean Tegner activity level is 7 (8 before ACL injury) with 71% return to their previous sport level. IKDC global score noted 98% of good (22% B grade) and very good (76% A grade) results. In concentric test, 56% of patients have a hamstring muscle strength loss, with a mean deficit of 9% at 60°/s and 8.8% at 180°/s; 76% had a quadriceps strength loss, with a mean deficit of 15% at 60°/s and 11% at 180°/s. The hamstring and quadriceps deficit is around 9% in eccentric test. The ratio hamstring/quadriceps are symmetrical between the treated knee and the healthy one. No significant difference is related. Discussion-Conclusion: These results are in accordance with the principal series in the literature. The agonist-antagonist muscular obtained balance shows a fearly good analytical muscular recovery. The functional outcomes agree with other studies. Thus, this technique of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is reliable, respect extensor system and does not disturb hamstring muscle recovery. © 2005 - IOS Press and the authors.

Axial spin-echo T1 weighted MRI images were acquired from the level of the ankle mortise to the iliac crest. The subjects' quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles were digitally reconstructed from the MRI images. The volume and peak cross-sectional area (CSA) of each muscle were then calculated. Voluntary muscle control was evaluated using an established target-matching protocol that requires subjects to produce and modulate force with control over a range of directions. Electromyographic signals were collected from seven muscles as the subjects performed the experiment. Circular statistics methods were used to calculate a specificity index that describes how focused the activity pattern of each muscle was with respect to its principal direction of action. The results of the non-copers, copers, and uninjured subjects were then compared. The non-copers displayed significantly greater quadriceps atrophy than the copers. The most profound differences were observed in the vastus lateralis muscle. The non-copers also displayed diminished vastus lateralis and lateral gastrocnemius muscle control. Little differences were observed in the results of the copers and uninjured subjects. In general, the copers' results fell between those of the non-copers and uninjured subjects. The results of this study suggest that quadriceps muscle function is a critical factor in the differential response to ACL injury. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect that this procedure has on voluntary muscle control remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect that anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autologous semitendinosus-gracilis graft has on voluntary muscle control by assessing subjects' specificity of muscle action. The voluntary muscle control of 10 people (seven males, three females) with acute, isolated ACL ruptures was assessed in the days prior to when they underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadrupled autologous semitendinosus-gracilis grafts and after they had returned to play in sports requiring quick changes of direction and jumping (approximately 6 months later). The experimental protocol included the use of an established target-matching protocol that requires subjects to produce and modulate force with fine control, electromyographic recordings from 11 muscles about the knee, and the use of circular statistics to calculate specificity indices that describe the degree of focus (specificity) associated with the activity pattern of each muscle. Data were analyzed by performing pre-surgery and post-return to sports side-to-side comparisons, as well as, pre-surgery to post-surgery ipsilateral comparisons. Diminished specificity of muscle action was observed in the activity patterns of most of the muscles of the subjects' anterior cruciate ligament deficient knees prior to surgery. The quadriceps muscles were particularly affected. Post-return to sports results indicated that voluntary muscle control had improved in most muscles. There was no significant difference in pre-surgery and post-return to sports semitendinosus and gracilis muscle control. The semimembranosus muscle displayed less specific muscle activity patterns following surgery, which may represent a compensation strategy for minor changes in neuromuscular function. Voluntary muscle control improved in most muscles following ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus-gracilis autografts. Semitendinosus and gracilis muscle control did not appear to be altered significantly by the procedure. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Few studies have evaluated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction under physiological loads. Purpose: To determine whether anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction reproduced knee motion under simulated muscle loads. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Eight human cadaveric knees were tested with the anterior cruciate ligament intact, transected, and reconstructed (using a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft) on a robotic testing system. Tibial translation and rotation were measured at 0°, 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion under anterior drawer loading (130 N), quadriceps muscle loading (400 N), and combined quadriceps and hamstring muscle loading (400 N and 200 N, respectively). Repeated-measures analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used to detect statistically significant differences between knee states. Results: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction resulted in a clinically satisfactory anterior tibial translation. The anterior tibial translation of the reconstructed knee was 1.93 mm larger than the intact knee at 30° of flexion under anterior load. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction overconstrained tibial rotation, causing significantly less internal tibial rotation in the reconstructed knee at low flexion angles (0°-30°) under muscle loads (P < .05). At 30° of flexion, under muscle loads, the tibia of the reconstructed knee was 1.9° externally rotated compared to the intact knee. Conclusions: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may not restore the rotational kinematics of the intact knee under muscle loads, even though anterior tibial translation was restored to a clinically satisfactory level under anterior drawer loads. These data suggest that reproducing anterior stability under anterior tibial loads may not ensure that knee joint kinematics is restored under physiological loading conditions. Clinical Relevance: Decreased internal rotation of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may lead to increased patellofemoral joint contact pressures. Future anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques should aim at restoring 3-dimensional knee kinematics under physiological loads.","ACL reconstruction; Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Biomechanics; Muscle loads; Robotic testing","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; cadaver; controlled study; hamstring; human; human tissue; joint function; joint stability; kinematics; ligament surgery; muscle function; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; robotics; rotation; simulation; surgical technique; weight bearing; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Muscle, Skeletal; Robotics; Rotation; Rupture","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 4, pp. 510-516, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Anderson, Allen F., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Intersegmental forces and moments in directions that would produce anterior-posterior (AP) translation, internal-external (IE) rotation and flexion-extension (FE) at the knee were compared with the respective translation and rotations of the tibia relative to the femur during four selected phases (heel strike, weight acceptance, terminal extension and swing) of the walking cycle. The kinematic changes associated with loss of the ACL occurred primarily during the terminal portion of swing phase of the walking cycle where, for the ACL deficient knee, the tibia had reduced external rotation and anterior translation as the knee extended prior to heel strike. The kinematic changes during swing phase were associated with a rotational offset relative to the contralateral knee in the average position of the tibia towards internal rotation. The offset was maintained through the entire gait cycle. The abnormal offsets in the rotational position were correlated with the magnitude of the flexion moment (balanced by a net quadriceps moment) during weight acceptance. These results suggest that adaptations to the patterns of muscle firing during walking can compensate for kinematic changes associated with the loss of the ACL. The altered rotational position would cause changes in tibiofemoral contact during walking that could cause the type of degenerative changes reported in the meniscus and the articular cartilage following ACL injury. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to prevent degenerative changes, meniscus replacement by autogenous quadriceps tendon was performed from 1986 until 1999 in 45 patients. In 29 patients, a reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament was done simultaneously. This study was intended to detect whether this meniscus replacement led to better subjective, clinical and radiological results in comparison to meniscectomised knees or meniscal allografts reported in the literature. Methods: A standardised examination of the patients (4-17 years postoperatively, average 9 years) was carried out using the KOOS questionnaire, the IKDC examination form and a weight-bearing radiograph of the knee. Results: 34 patients took part in the study. KOOS subgroups showed fair results for symptoms (25-96 points, average 65), but bad results for sports and quality of life (0-100, average 52; QoL 6-94, average 54). Clinical and radiological examination demonstrated on average stable knee joints without effusion (IKDC group A), but X-rays showed in most cases a clear or severe osteoarthritis of the knee (IKDC group C). Clinical and radiological findings demonstrated similar results in comparison with studies investigating results after meniscectomy without meniscus replacement. Concerning subjective results, meniscus replacement with quadriceps tendon was inferior to cryopreserved meniscal allografts. However, patients after meniscal allograft transplantation also show increasing degenerative changes of the respective joint in radiological follow-up studies. Conclusion: In the patient group studied here with pre-existing chondromalacia of the respective knee joint compartment and preoperative anterior instability, no advantage of meniscus replacement using quadriceps tendon over the normal course after meniscectomy could be proven. Therefore, this procedure cannot be generally recommended.","Autogenous; Follow-up; Meniscus replacement; Quadriceps tendon","anterior cruciate ligament; article; chondromalacia; clinical article; follow up; human; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; meniscectomy; pain assessment; quadriceps femoris muscle; quality of life; questionnaire; tendon graft; weight bearing; Adolescent; Adult; Arthralgia; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Comorbidity; Data Collection; Female; Germany; Humans; Joint Instability; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patient Satisfaction; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Fairbank, Thomas J., Knee joint changes after meniscectomy., The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

This can be achieved through three-dimensional kinematic analysis, because it provides an objective evaluation in vivo of the knee joint function. It has been demonstrated that ACL-deficient patients develop functional adaptations (ie, quadriceps avoidance gait) and walk with the knee in a more extended position to compensate for the ACL loss. Furthermore, it has been shown that ACL rupture results in anterior tibial translation and excessive tibial rotation while performing everyday activities. Although anterior tibial translation is restored with ACL reconstruction, tibial rotation seems to be restored only during low-demanding activities, whereas it remains increased during high-demanding activities. A possible explanation for the lack of restoration of tibial rotation to normal levels is the absence of complete reinstatement of the actual anatomy of the ACL. Reconstruction techniques should become more anatomic and try to approximate both ACL bundles. Two-bundle reconstruction may have advantages over single-bundle reconstruction, with respect to regaining a structure that morphologically and functionally better resembles a normal ACL. This technique however, has not been investigated dynamically, and future research should be performed. Therefore, long-term follow-up studies should focus on the advantages and disadvantages of different surgical procedures, whether it is the graft material or the tunnel positioning, so that dynamic knee function is restored and future pathology of the knee joint is prevented. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Knee joint sagittal plane forces are a proposed mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament injury during sport movements such as sidestep cutting. Ligament force magnitudes for these movements however, remain unknown. The need to examine injury-causing events suggests elucidation via model-based investigations is possible. Using this approach, the current study determined whether sagittal plane knee loading during sidestep cutting could in isolation injure the anterior cruciate ligament.Methods. Experiments were performed on subject-specific forward dynamic musculoskeletal models, generated from data obtained from 10 male and 10 female athletes. Models were optimized to simulate subject-specific cutting movements. Random perturbations (n = 5000) were applied to initial contact conditions and quadriceps/hamstrings activation levels to simulate their effect on peak 3D knee loads. Injury via the sagittal plane mechanism was based on the criterion of an anterior drawer force greater than 2000 N.Findings. Realistic neuromuscular perturbations produced significant increases in external knee anterior force and valgus and internal rotation moments. Peak anterior drawer force never exceeded 2000 N in any model, and thus failed to cause anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Valgus loads reached values that were high enough to rupture the ligament, occurring more frequently in females than in males.Interpretation. Sagittal plane knee joint forces cannot rupture the anterior cruciate ligament during sidestep cutting. The interaction between muscle and joint mechanics and external ground reaction forces in this plane, places a ceiling on ligament loads. Valgus loading is a more likely injury mechanism, especially in females. Modifying sagittal plane biomechanics will thus unlikely contribute to the prevention of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The quadriceps strength was isokinetically measured during concentric and eccentric contractions. When the muscle strength was examined before ACL reconstruction, the injured/uninjured ratio was 72.9% for eccentric contraction, which was significantly lower than the 81.4% for concentric contraction. For postoperative muscle, the injured/uninjured ratio was 98.6% for eccentric contraction and 80.6% for concentric contraction, showing better recovery of muscle strength for eccentric contraction. The observation of lower muscle strength for eccentric contraction than for concentric contraction in knees before ACL reconstruction may be explained by the fact that movements such as stop and turn become difficult due to ACL dysfunction. The result is that the patient avoids exerting eccentric knee extension and contraction forces even in daily living activities. On the other hand, once the joint instability is improved by ACL reconstruction, patients do not need to avoid movements such as stop and climbing down stairs that require eccentric contraction strength.

The patella tendon to tibial shaft angle causes an anterior tibial shear force with quadriceps activation. Hypothesis: An aggressive quadriceps contraction can injure the ACL. Methods: The authors characterized noncontact ACL injury and kinematics with aggressive quadriceps loading. Thirteen fresh-frozen knees were potted in a jig held in 20° of flexion while a 4500 N quadriceps contraction was simulated. Knee kinematics were recorded. A KT-1000 arthrometer and a simulated active quadriceps test assessed anterior displacement. Statistics were performed using paired t tests and 1-way analysis of variance. Results: Kinematics revealed the following mean values: anterior displacement, 19.5 mm; valgus, 2.3°; and internal rotation, 5.5°. Mean KT-1000 and active quadriceps test differences were 4.0 mm and 2.7 mm, respectively (statistically significant P = .002 and P = .002). Six knees showed gross ACL injury at the femoral insertion. Based on ACL injury, KT-1000 differences were statistically significant (P = .029). Conclusions: Aggressive quadriceps loading, with the knee in slight flexion, produces significant anterior tibial translation and ACL injury. This suggests that the quadriceps is the intrinsic force in noncontact ACL injuries, producing a model for further investigation.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Kinematics; Noncontact; Quadriceps","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; biomechanics; clinical article; female; human; kinematics; knee injury; knee ligament injury; ligament injury; loading test; male; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Cadaver; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Leg; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Patella; Posture; Weight-Bearing","","","","","","","Arendt, Elizabeth Anne, Knee Injury Patterns Among Men and Women in Collegiate Basketball and Soccer: NCAA Data and Review of Literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 694-701, (1995); Arms, Steven W., The biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation and reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 8-18, (1984); Artmann, M., Investigation of the appropriate functional replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament, Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und Ihre Grenzgebiete, 112, 1, pp. 160-165, (1974); Bach, Joel M., A new load application system for in vitro study of ligamentous injuries to the human knee joint, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 117, 4, pp. 373-382, (1995); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Empty wall"" and ""vertical strut"" signs of ACL insufficiency, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 5, 2, pp. 137-140, (1989); Boden, Barry P., Mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injury, Orthopedics, 23, 6, pp. 573-578, (2000); Butler, David L., Ligamentous restraints to anterior-posterior drawer in the human knee.

The aim of this investigation was to study the effects of muscle loads on the in situ forces in both ligaments at high knee flexion (>120°). Eighteen fresh-frozen human knee specimens were tested on a robotic testing system from full extension to 150° of flexion in response to quadriceps (400 N), hamstrings (200 N), and combined quadriceps and hamstrings (400 N/200 N) loads. The in situ forces in the ACL and PCL were measured using the principle of superposition. The force in the ACL peaked at 30° of flexion (71.7 ± 27.9 N in response to the quadriceps load, 52.3 ± 24.4 N in response to the combined muscle load, 32.3 ± 20.9 N in response to the hamstrings load). At 150°, the ACL force was approximately 30 N in response to the quadriceps load and 20 N in response to the combined muscle load and isolated hamstring load. The PCL force peaked at 90° (34.0 ± 15.3 N in response to the quadriceps load, 88.6 ± 23.7 N in response to the combined muscle load, 99.8 ± 24.0 N in response to the hamstrings load) and decreased to around 35 N at 150° in response to each of the loads.These results demonstrate that the ACL and PCL carried significantly less load at high flexion in response to the simulated muscle loads compared to the peak loads they carried in response to the same muscle loads at other flexion angles. The data could provide a reference point for the investigation of non-weight bearing flexion and extension knee exercises in high flexion. Furthermore, these data could be useful in designing total knee implants to achieve high flexion. © 2003 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Type of Study:A case series of patients who had received arthroscopic ACL reconstructions using quadriceps tendon autograft was retrospectively evaluated. Methods: Sixty-seven ACL reconstructions were evaluated at a mean of 41 months (range, 27 to 49 months). Clinical assessment was made using a modified Lysholm score, documentation of International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the anterior knee pain questionnaire of Shelbourne and Trumper, and by KT-2000 arthrometric analysis. Isokinetic strength testing and radiographic assessments were also performed. Results: Arthrometric analysis showed that 63 knees (94%) were graded A or B with a median laxity of 2 mm postoperatively. The Lysholm score improved postoperatively from 71 to 90 (P ≤ .05). Extension peak torque of the quadriceps muscle recovered to 82% and 89% of that of the contralateral knee at 180°/second at 1 year and 2 years after surgery, respectively. The patellar position in terms of congruence angle and Insall-Salvati ratio did not show any significant change. Only 4 patients complained of moderate pain on kneeling and 1 patient complained of harvest-site tenderness. Conclusions: ACL reconstruction using a quadriceps tendon autograft showed satisfactory results with reduced donor-site morbidities. The quadriceps tendon can be a reliable source of graft, and is comparable to bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring tendon in ACL reconstruction.

The purpose of this study was to examine the strength of the quadriceps and the hamstrings in ACL-deficient amateur soccer players at different levels of functional status. Thirty male amateur soccer players were separated into three groups according to their Lysholm score; the high-L1 (Lysholm ≥84), the intermediate-L2 (84> Lysholm ≥72) and the low-L3 (Lysholm <72) knee function groups. The control group consisted of 12 amateur soccer players. The strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings was assessed isokinetically at 60°/s. The quadriceps demonstrated significant deficits of the injured knee compared to the intact knee in all groups, whilst the hamstrings showed significant weakness only in the low function group. Respective percentage deficits in groups L1, L2 and L3 were 13.7%, 16.0% and 18.6% for the quadriceps and 2.4%, 5.6% and 19.2% for the hamstrings. All groups had significant quadriceps weakness which did not differ between the groups. In contrast, the strength deficit of the hamstrings was an indicator of poor knee function, since they were significantly weak only in group L3, which represented patients who clearly failed to compensate for instability symptoms. In groups L1 and L2 the side-to-side differences were within the area of asymmetry measured in the control group.

Subjects: Nineteen female collegiate basketball players from a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I program (8 subjects) and a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Division II program (11 subjects) who had no history of anterior cruciate ligament injury and who had no history of any lower extremity injury during the preceding 6 months. Measurements: The variables of primary interest were hamstrings and quadriceps isokinetic peak torque. Of secondary interest were 5 variables derived from step-down and lunging maneuvers performed on a computerized forceplate system and 4 variables derived from tracking the position of the body core during performance of a T-pattern agility drill with a computerized infrared tracking system. Results: A significant group x trial interaction was found for hamstrings peak torque at 60°·s -1 (F<inf>1.17</inf> = 9.16, P = .008.), and the proportion of total variance attributable to the treatment effect produced by the jump-training program was relatively large (η2 = .35, ω2 = .30). None of the other variables demonstrated statistically significant changes. Conclusions: Our primary results support plyometric jump training as a strategy for improving neuromuscular attributes that are believed to reduce the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury in female college basketball players. They also provide the basis for reasonable isokinetic strength goals.","Antagonist strength ratio; Isokinetic testing; Muscle coactivation","adolescent; adult; anamnesis; anterior cruciate ligament; article; athlete; basketball; body position; college student; comparative study; computer system; controlled study; experiment; female; hamstring; human; human experiment; infrared radiation; jumping; knee ligament injury; laboratory; leg injury; methodology; muscle isometric contraction; neuromuscular system; normal human; quadriceps femoris muscle; statistical significance; task performance; torque; training","","","","","","","Dunnam, Laura O., Comprehensive evaluation of the University of Alabama at Birmingham women’s volleyball training program, National Strength and Conditioning Association Journal, 10, 1, pp. 43-49, (1988); Grace, T.

The source of pain is often not known nor is the reason for a simultaneous decrease in thigh muscle strength. Anterior knee pain has also been reported following an anterior cruciate ligament rupture. No previous investigation has assessed whether weakness of the thigh muscles is associated with anterior knee pain following intramedullary nailing of tibial shaft fractures. Design: Prospective study. Setting: University Hospital of Tampere, University of Tampere. Patients: Fifty consecutive patients with a nailed tibial shaft fracture were initially included in the study. Ten patients did not have isokinetic strength testing for various reasons and were eliminated from the study. Main Outcome Measurements: Isokinetic muscle strength measurements were done in 40 patients at an average 3.2 ± 0.4 (SD) years after nail insertion (1.7 ± 0.3 years after the nail extraction). Results: Twelve (30%) patients were painless and 28 (70%) patients had anterior knee pain at follow-up. With reference to the hamstrings muscles, the mean peak torque deficit of the injured limb (as compared with the uninjured limb) was 2 ± 11% in the painless group and 11 ± 17% in the pain group at a speed of 60°/s (P = 0.09, [95% CI for the group difference = -18% to O%]). At a speed of 180°/s, the corresponding deficits were -3 ± 13% and 10 ± 21% (P = 0.03, [95% CI for the group difference = -4% to -2%]). With reference to the quadriceps muscles, the mean peak torque deficit of the injured limb was 14 ± 15% in the painless group and 15 ± 15% in the pain group at speed of 60°/s (P = 0.71, [95% CI for the group difference = -11% to 10%]). At a speed of 180°/s, the corresponding deficits were 9 ± 11% and 14 ± 17% (P = 0.46, [95% CI for the group difference = -14% to 5%]). Conclusion: Based on this prospective study, we conclude that anterior knee pain after intramedullary nailing of a tibial shaft fracture, although of multifactorial origin, may be related to deficiency in the flexion strength of the thigh muscles.","Anterior knee pain; Intramedullary nailing; Thigh muscle strength; Tibial fracture","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; chronic pain; clinical article; controlled study; female; Finland; follow up; hamstring; human; interlocking nail; intramedullary nailing; isokinetic exercise; knee pain; male; muscle strength; muscle weakness; priority journal; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; thigh; tibia shaft fracture; torque; university hospital; Adult; Chronic Disease; Female; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary; Humans; Knee; Male; Pain, Postoperative; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Tibial Fractures","","","","","","","Alho, Antti V., Locked intramedullary nailing for displaced tibial shaft fractures, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 72, 5, pp. 805-809, (1990); Bone, Lawrence B., Displaced isolated fractures of the tibial shaft treated with either a cast or intramedullary nailing: An outcome analysis of matched pairs of patients, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 79, 9, pp. 1336-1341, (1997); Court-Brown, Charles M., Closed intramedullary tibial nailing.

ACL reconstruction with a semi-tendinosus tendon graft was performed on 100 patients with isolated ACL injury from January 1996 to December 1999: femoral fixation was obtained with Endobutton and tibial fixation with Fastlok. Patients were evaluated for standard knee scores and functional strength tests, postoperative pain rating, knee radiographs taken after surgery and at final follow-up, magnetic resonance images at 3 and 6 months, isokinetic flexion-extension and internal-external rotation tests at 3, 6, and 12 months. Computerized laxity analysis was performed at final evaluation. Average surgical time was 85 minutes, including 13 minutes for graft preparation; 90% of the patients were discharged within 24 h. Subjective knee rating was 80%; kneeling test was positive in 7% and Werner score was 44 (range, 30-48). Lachman test was negative in 90% at final evaluation (mean follow-up, 38 months). Sensory changes at the anterior part of the proximal tibia were present in 30% at 3 months and 10% had definite hyposthesia. MRI showed graft incorporation at 3 months. Computerized laxity analysis revealed 90% with less than 3-mm side-to-side differences. Isokinetic testing showed normal hamstring and quadriceps peak torques at 12 months. The functional strength tests were normal by 6 months. Average Noyes score was 87.9, Lysholm score 93, and Tegner activity rating 6.0 (pre-injury, 6.1). IKDC score showed 90 normal or nearly normal knees, 9 abnormal, and one severely abnormal knee. Quadrupled bone-semitendinosus is a viable graft for ACL reconstruction and should be considered, especially in patients with pre-existing extensor mechanism problems.","ACL reconstruction; Hamstring tendon; Semitendinosus tendon","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; computer analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; fracture fixation; functional assessment; healing; human; isokinetic exercise; joint function; joint laxity; knee arthroplasty; knee injury; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; operation duration; pain assessment; postoperative pain; priority journal; prospective study; scoring system; semitendinous muscle; sensory dysfunction; tendon graft; tibia","","","","","","","Fu, Freddie H., Current trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Part II.

The IKDC score showed 92% of normal or nearly normal knees. Of the 50 patients 48 regained full extension, and only two had extension deficit between 0° and 3°. KT evaluation was less than 3 mm in 38 cases (76%), 3-5 mm in 9 (18%), and more than 5 mm in 3 (6%). In 90% of cases the patient resumed sport at the same level. The mean Tegner activity score was 8.1 (5-10). The isokinetic test showed no deficit for hamstring and quadriceps muscles.

It has not been established, however, whether either of these techniques provides a greater functional advantage to the patient. Purpose: To identify patients' functional capabilities after reconstruction of the ACL with a patellar or semitendinosus tendon autograft. Methods: Forty male soccer players volunteered for the study and were assigned to three homogeneous groups: individuals who had patellar tendon reconstruction (N = 15), individuals who had semitendinosus tendon reconstruction (N = 15), and a control group (N = 10). All patients had undergone surgery 2 yr before this study and received the same rehabilitation training. The testing procedures included measurement of thigh circumference, maximal isometric strength of quadriceps and hamstrings, two- and one-legged jump, squat and gait analysis. Kinetic, kinematic, and electromyographic data were collected. Results: The patellar tendon group exhibited lower (P < 0.05) coactivation of the agonist and antagonist muscles around the knee joint during the squat movement and lower stabilization- and landing degrees during the jumps. Furthermore, the patellar tendon group had a shorter stance phase and reached the first vertical maximum later with the impaired leg while walking (720.2 ± 15.6 ms vs 740.3 ± 14.3 ms, and 24.3 ± 0.64% vs 22.9 ± 0.74% of stance phase), which was not observed in the semitendinosus tendon and control groups. Conclusion: Functional performance is compromised in patients who undergo a patellar tendon graft compared with a semitendinosus graft, possibly due to an altered activation of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles.","EMG; GAIT analysis; Knee stability; Neuromuscular control; SQUAT","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; controlled study; electromyography; functional assessment; gait; hamstring; human; jumping; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; ligament surgery; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; quadriceps femoris muscle; semitendinous muscle; sport injury; standing; tendon graft; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electromyography; Exercise; Gait; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Patellar Ligament; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Baker, Daniel G., Generality versus specificity: a comparison of dynamic and isometric measures of strength and speed-strength, European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology, 68, 4, pp. 350-355, (1994); Boden, Barry P., Mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injury, Orthopedics, 23, 6, pp. 573-578, (2000); Carter, Thomas R., Isokinetic evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Hamstring versus patellar tendon, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 15, 2, pp. 169-172, (1999); Chappell, Jonathan D., A comparison of knee kinetics between male and female recreational athletes in stop-jump tasks, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 2, pp. 261-267, (2002); Corrigan, J.

Material and methods: 98 patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction with bone-tendon-bone patellar autograft were included in the study. There were 76 male and 22 female patients with a mean age of 27.1±7.7 years. They were evaluated for pain intensity level, range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, edema-effusion and functional level before the treatment. The rehabilitation protocol consisted of six phases, which was between 0-24 weeks All the patients were re-evaluated after three weeks and 1 year postoperatively. Results: There were significant differences in ROM and circumferential measurements of the knee after the treatment and at 1-year follow-up. Muscle strength of Quadriceps and Hamstrings showed significant increase (p<0.05). There was also significant pain relief in all the patients. The functional level according to the Lysholm Scoring System was found significantly improved after the treatment (p<0.05). Discussion: It can be concluded that our special rehabilitation program for ACL reconstructed patients has beneficial effects.","Anterior cruciat ligament; Knee; Rehabilitation; Treatment protocol","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical protocol; clinical trial; edema; female; functional assessment; hamstring; human; joint effusion; joint mobility; ligament surgery; Lysholm Scoring System; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; patella tendon graft; quadriceps femoris muscle; rehabilitation medicine; scoring system; tendon graft","","","","","","","Noyes, Frank R., Bone-patellar ligament-bone and fascia lata allografts for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 8, pp. 1125-1136, (1990); O'Brien, Stephen J., Reconstruction of the chronically insufficient anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 73, 2, pp. 278-286, (1991); Gotlin, Robert S., Anterior cruciate ligament injuries: Operative and rehabilitative options, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America, 11, 4, pp. 895-928, (2000); Tovin, Brian J., Surgical and biomechanical considerations in rehabilitation of patients with intra-articular ACL reconstructions, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 15, 6, pp. 317-322, (1992); Podesta, Luga, Rationale and protocol for postoperative anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 257, pp. 262-273, (1990); Paulos, Lonnie E., Knee rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and repair, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 9, 3, pp. 140-149, (1981); Delitto, Anthony M., Electrical stimulation versus voluntary exercise in strengthening thigh musculature after anterior cruciate ligament surgery, Physical Therapy, 68, 5, pp. 660-663, (1988); Brownstein, Bruce, Patella fractures associated with accelerated ACL rehabilitation in patients with autogenous patella tendon reconstructions, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 26, 3, pp. 168-172, (1997); Hardin, James Allen, The effects of 'decelerated' rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on a hyperelastic female adolescent: A case study, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 26, 1, pp. 29-34, (1997); Shelbourne, K.

Two cases of symptomatic deep-venous thrombosis occurred in the early group. The mean range of movement was significantly greater at two weeks in the delayed group. Quadriceps muscle power was significantly better in the delayed group at 12 weeks (p < 0.05). These trends were evident at later time points, but were not statistically significant.

The second purpose was to establish the determinants of functional ability for the operated limb. Methods: Ten participants with unilateral ACL reconstructions were randomly assigned to one of the following 12-week training protocols: (1) isotonic ST, and (2) PT. The outcome measures were: (1) peak torque time of the hamstring muscles (PeakTT), (2) average concentric and eccentric torques of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, (3) one-legged single hop for distance (SLHD), (4) one-legged time hop (TH), and (5) subjective scores. Results: There was a significant group by time interaction effect for PeakTT (P = 0.017). The PT group demonstrated greater percent change in isokinetic torques than the ST group at the end of the 12 weeks (P ≤ 0.05). Participants in both groups demonstrated similar significant gains in functional ability and subjective scores (P ≤ 0.014). Quadriceps strength is a determinant of functional ability for the operated limb (R2 = 0.72). Conclusions: Both training protocols influenced PeakTT. The beneficial effects of ST on PeakTT appear to be load-dependent, while sufficient practice may be crucial in maintaining PeakTT improvements induced by PT. Proprioceptive training alone can induce isokinetic strength gains. Restoring and increasing quadriceps strength is essential to maximize functional ability of the operated knee joint.","ACL injury; Neuromuscular control; Rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; exercise; female; hamstring; human; human experiment; isokinetic exercise; ligament surgery; limb; male; muscle strength; neuromuscular function; outcomes research; proprioception; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; statistical significance; training; comparative study; injury; knee; knee injury; pathophysiology; regression analysis; skeletal muscle; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Proprioception; Regression Analysis","","","","","","","Ellison, Arthur E., Embryology, anatomy, and function of the anterior cruciate ligament, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 16, 1, pp. 3-14, (1985); Novak, Peter J., Clinical and functional outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the recreational athlete over the age of 35., The American journal of knee surgery, 9, 3, pp. 111-116, (1996); Nyland, John A., A case study of an accelerated rehabilitation program on knee function following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 2, 1, pp. 53-62, (1993); Timoney, J.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between muscle strength and functional stability in 31 patients pre- and post-operatively, following a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture. All subjects underwent reconstructive surgery using semitendonosis and gracilis tendons. Isokinetic strength assessment of quadriceps and hamstring muscles was performed at a rate of movement of 60°/s and 120°/s. Functional stability was determined by performance during five functional stability tests that included the shuttle run, side step, carioca, single and triple hop tests. Pearson's correlation coefficient statistics were applied to pre-operative and post-operative data respectively. These analyses demonstrated a significant positive correlation between quadriceps strength indices at both testing speeds and the two hop tests pre-operatively (p's < 0.007) and between quadriceps strength indices at both speeds and all five functional tests post-operatively (p's < 0.01). Assessed using Steiger's formula, there was a significant increase in the correlation between quadriceps strength indices and three functional tests post-operatively compared to pre-operatively (p < 0.05). No significant correlation between hamstring strength indices and functional scores existed pre- or post-operatively. This study has shown a significant correlation exists between quadriceps strength indices and functional stability both before and after surgery, this relationship does not reach significance between hamstring strength indices and functional stability. © 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

A transverse dislocated patella fracture is a rare complication of this procedure with an incidence of 0.23%-2.3%. In a five year period, (1998-2002), 407 arthroscopic reconstructions of the anterior cruciate ligaments were done at our Clinic, and there was only one case of patella fracture. CASE REPORT: An 18-year-old female patient, a handball player, suffered an acute rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee, so arthroscopic bone-tendon-bone reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament was performed. After adequate skin incision, a bone graft was taken from the patella and upper part of trapezoid tibia, which was 25 mm long, 10 mm wide and 5 mm thick, together with a part of patellar ligament. After the remains of the anterior cruciate ligament had been arthroscopically removed, tunnels were made in tibia and femur and a graft was inserted and fixed with two metal interference screws. Knee stability was tested, and drainage was put in the knee joint. The wound was closed by layers. The quadriceps exercises and passive knee movements started immediately. Full range of movements was accomplished six weeks later when the patient started to walk with full weight-bearing on her operated leg. Three weeks later, (nine weeks after the operation), the patient has accidentally lost her balance and fell. A transverse, dislocated fracture of the left patella was diagnosed and osteosynthesis of the fractured patella with two Kirschner wires and a metallic loop was performed. Postoperatively, full range of movement was allowed. Six months later, the patient felt no pain, there was no swelling, full range of knee movement was achieved, while the Lachman Test was identical in both knees and the pivot shift test was negative. DISCUSSION: Fracture of patella after ACL reconstruction is due to several reasons: size and shape of the graft, technique of its taking, disturbed patellar blood supply, incomplete filling of patella defect after graft taking, and inappropriate postoperative rehabilitation. If a patellar fracture occurs after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the best treatment is firm osteosynthesis, which enables bone healing and immediate continuation of the previously resumed rehabilitation program. However, this complication prolongs the rehabilitation period and slows down return to sports.","","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; female; fracture; human; injury; patella; rupture; sport injury; Adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Athletic Injuries; Female; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Patella; Rupture","","","","","","","","M.

Design: Cross-sectional comparative clinical trial. Setting: Motion analysis laboratory. Participants: Ten active individuals with unilateral, isolated, chronic (>18mo postinjury), ACL-deficient knees who subjectively reported improved function with a functional knee bracing. Intervention: Each subject completed 3 single-leg hop maneuvers on their ACL-deficient knee with and without their knee brace while surface electromyographic activity was recorded from the quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscles. Main Outcome Measure: Muscle onset latency. Results: Brace use significantly delayed the average onset of vastus lateralis activation before landing (123±47ms vs 109±30ms, P<.001), though significant interindividual variations existed. Bracing significantly altered the onset latency in 1 or more muscles in 9 of 10 subjects. In 4 subjects, a favorable change in the firing pattern was seen, whereas only 1 subject exhibited an unfavorable change. Without bracing, 5 of the 10 subjects fired the hamstrings or gastrocnemius muscles first; with bracing, 7 of 10 fired these muscles first. Conclusions: Brace use in this population did not consistently result in more favorable muscle firing patterns during the single-leg hop maneuver. Interindividual responses to brace use indicate the need for further research to investigate the multiple strategies that may exist to stabilize the ACL-deficient knee. In the meantime, functional knee brace use among ACL-deficient patients remains empirical.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Braces; Proprioception; Rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; biomechanics; brace; clinical article; electromyography; female; gastrocnemius muscle; human; joint stability; knee function; male; muscle contraction; neuromuscular transmission; proprioception; quadriceps femoris muscle; sport injury","","","","","","","Cawley, Patrick W., The current state of functional knee bracing research: A review of the literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 3, pp. 226-233, (1991); Styf, Jorma R., The effects of functional knee bracing on muscle function and performance, Sports Medicine, 28, 2, pp. 77-81, (1999); Decoster, Laura C., Functional ACL bracing: A survey of current opinion and practice, American Journal of Orthopedics, 24, 11, pp. 838-842, (1995); Cook, Frank F., A dynamic analysis of a functional brace for anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 4, pp. 519-524, (1989); Noyes, Frank R., The symptomatic anterior cruciate-deficient knee.

Type of Study: Outcomes study. Methods: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with an STB graft was performed on 80 athletes with isolated ACL injury from January 1996 to December 1999. Femoral fixation was obtained with EndoButton (Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA) and tibial fixation with Fastlok (Neoligaments, Leeds, England). At a mean follow-up time of 36 months (range, 24-52 months), patients were evaluated using standard knee scores (Noyes, Lysholm, Tegner, and International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] rating) and functional strength tests; postoperative pain rating; knee radiographs performed after surgery and at final follow-up; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 to 6 months; isokinetic flexion-extension and internal-external rotation tests at 3, 6, and 12 months; and computed laxity analysis at final evaluation. Results: At final evaluation, subjective knee rating was 87%, kneeling test was positive in 7%, and Werner score was 44 of 50 (range, 30-48). Lachman test was negative in 90% at final evaluation. Sensory changes were present in 30% at 3 months, and 10% had definite hyposthesia. Computed laxity analysis revealed 90% with less than 3 mm side-to-side difference. Isokinetic testing showed normal hamstring and quadriceps peak torques at 12 months. The one-leg hop test and vertical jump were normal by 6 months. At final evaluation, average Noyes score was 88 (range, 65-100); Lysholm score, 91 (range, 70-100); postoperative Tegner rating, 6.5 (range, 5-9); and preinjury Tegner rating, 7.5 (range, 7-10). IKDC score showed 72 knees normal or nearly normal, 7 abnormal, and 1 severely abnormal. Sixty-five percent of patients returned to the same preinjury sports level. Conclusions: The quadrupled bone-semitendinosus graft is a viable graft for ACL reconstruction and should be considered, especially for patients with extensor mechanism problems.","ACL Reconstruction; Hamstring tendon; Semitendinosus","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; athlete; bone graft; bone remodeling; bone semitendinosus graft; bone strength; controlled study; disease severity; donor; evaluation; female; femur; follow up; hamstring; human; human tissue; hypothesis; isokinetic exercise; joint laxity; major clinical study; male; morbidity; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteosynthesis; patient satisfaction; postoperative pain; rating scale; rotation; scoring system; semitendinous muscle; sport; sport injury; tibia; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopically assisted semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft in reconstruction for acute anterior cruciate ligament injuries in athletes, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 6, pp. 726-731, (1996); Gobbi, Alberto W., Patellar tendon versus quadrupled bone-semitendinosus anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective clinical investigation in athletes, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 19, 6, pp. 592-601, (2003); Aune, Arne Kristian, Four-strand hamstring tendon autograft compared with patellar tendon-bone autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomized study with two-year follow-up, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 722-728, (2001); Fu, Freddie H., Current trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Part II.

Purpose: To evaluate the influence of hamstring tendon harvest on knee flexion strength in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Prospective randomized study. Methods: Ninety patients were randomly assigned at surgery to undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with either a semitendinosus tendon autograft or a semitendinosus and gracilis tendon autograft. Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength was tested before surgery and at 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery. Results: There was no significant difference in clinical results between the groups and neither group showed a significant decrease in isokinetic hamstring muscle strength. However, when the subjects' knees were at positions of 70° or more of flexion, both isokinetic and isometric measurements revealed a significant decrease in hamstring muscle strength in both groups. The strength in the group with semitendinosus and gracilis tendons was considerably less than that in the group with semitendinosus tendon alone at 18 months. Conclusions: Tendon harvest causes significant weakness of hamstring muscle strength at high knee flexion angles, but such weakness can be minimized if the gracilis tendon is preserved. © 2003 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; brace; dynamometry; female; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; intermethod comparison; knee function; knee ligament injury; leg exercise; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; measurement; muscle strength; physiotherapy; postoperative care; priority journal; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; scoring system; semitendinous muscle; tendon graft; weight bearing","","","Cybex II dynamometer, Lumex; KT-1000 arthrometer, Medmetric","Lumex; Medmetric","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Carter, Thomas R., Isokinetic evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Hamstring versus patellar tendon, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 15, 2, pp. 169-172, (1999); Corry, Ian S., Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

An inverse dynamics approach was used to calculate joint kinematics and kinetics for flexion and extension. EMG signals of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles were recorded. The results showed that the peak knee flexion angle was greater in the copers than in the controls. There was a positive correlation between the peak knee extensor moment and peak knee flexion angle. Furthermore, at a given peak knee flexion angle, the peak knee extensor moment was significantly larger in the controls than in the non-copers. The hip extensor moment in the copers was significantly larger than that of the non-copers and the controls. In conclusion, the three groups walked according to different patterns. It is suggested that the copers stabilized their knee joint by co-contraction of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles, while the non-copers lacked this ability. Instead, the non-copers reduced the knee extensor moment in order to decrease anterior displacement of the tibia. The walking pattern differences observed between the copers and non-copers may explain their different post-injury activity levels.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Electromyography; Gait analysis; Inverse dynamics; Walking pattern","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; coping behavior; correlation coefficient; electromyogram; gait; hamstring; human; joint mobility; joint stability; kinematics; knee function; male; medical assessment; muscle contraction; physical activity; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; quantitative analysis; signal transduction; tibia; walking","","","","","","","Alkjaer, Tine, Comparison of inverse dynamics calculated by two- and three-dimensional models during walking, Gait and Posture, 13, 2, pp. 73-77, (2001); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Functional testing in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 40-47, (1993); Beard, David John, Gait and electromyographic analysis of anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects, Gait and Posture, 4, 2, pp. 83-88, (1996); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Bergmann, Georg, Influence of shoes and heel strike on the loading of the hip joint, Journal of Biomechanics, 28, 7, pp. 817-827, (1995); Boerboom, Alexander L., Atypical hamstrings electromyographic activity as a compensatory mechanism in anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 9, 4, pp. 211-216, (2001); Bulgheroni, Paolo, Gait patterns after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 1, pp. 14-21, (1997); Chmielewski, Terese L., Biomechanical evidence supporting a differential response to acute ACL injury, Clinical Biomechanics, 16, 7, pp. 586-591, (2001); Ciccotti, Michael G., An Electromyographic Analysis of the Knee During Functional Activities: II.

Hypotheses: Arthrometer measurements are not predictive of peak external knee flexion moment (net quadriceps muscle moment), isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength correlates with peak external knee flexion moment (net quadriceps muscle moment), and isokinetic hamstring muscle strength correlates with peak external knee extension moment (net flexor muscle moment). Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Gait analysis was used to assess dynamic function during walking, jogging, and stair climbing in 44 subjects with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and 44 control subjects. Passive knee laxity and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength were also measured. Results: Arthrometer measurements did not correlate with peak external flexion or extension moments in any of the activities tested or with isokinetic quadriceps or hamstring muscle strength. Test subjects also had a significantly reduced peak external flexion moment during all three jogging activities and stair climbing compared with the control subjects and this was correlated with significantly reduced quadriceps muscle strength. Conclusions: Absolute knee laxity difference did not correlate with dynamic knee function as assessed by gait analysis and should not be used as a sole predictor for the outcome of treatment. Patients with greater than normal strength in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient limb performed low- and high-stress activities in a more normal fashion than those with normal or less-than-normal strength. © 2003 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; clinical examination; controlled study; dynamometry; female; gait; hamstring; human; intermethod comparison; isokinetic exercise; knee function; knee ligament injury; male; muscle strength; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","Cybex II dynamometer, Lumex; Kin-Com dynamometer, Kin Com","Lumex; Kin Com","","","Andriacchi, Thomas P., A study of lower-limb mechanics during stair-climbing, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 62, 5, pp. 749-757, (1980); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Functional testing in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 40-47, (1993); American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Symposium on Sport Medicine the Knee, (1985); Basic Orthopaedic Biomechanics, (1997); Biomechanics of Normal and Pathological Human Articulating Joints, (1985); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthrometric evaluation of knees that have a torn anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 9, pp. 1299-1306, (1990); Barber, Sue D., Quantitative assessment of functional limitations in normal and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 255, pp. 204-214, (1990); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994)","","","American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","12531760","English","Am.

Fifty subjects (36 men, 14 women, age=20.6±1.3 years) at a mean of 31.0±16.3 months following ACLR participated in this study. Participation restrictions in activities of daily living and sports were measured by the combined scores of the Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale and Sports Activity Scale. The status of knee structures was assessed by determining the number of previously injured structures in the knee and the time from the most recent ACLR to testing. Performance-based activity limitations were assessed with the single leg hop for distance test. Impairments included isokinetic quadriceps function and anterior tibiofemoral joint laxity. Forward stepwise regression analysis revealed that while the number of injured knee structures alone accounted for 47% of the variability in patient-reported participation restrictions, the combination of the number of injured knee structures, time from ACLR, and the hop index provided the most effective estimate of participation restrictions. Isokinetic quadriceps function and KT-1000 side-to-side differences were not entered into the regression model and were not significant predictors of participation restrictions. We recommend that clinicians use caution in assuming that isokinetic quadriceps function and anterior tibiofemoral joint laxity provide an effective estimate of participation restrictions.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Knee surgery; Participation restrictions; Rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; articular cartilage; clinical trial; convalescence; daily life activity; female; human; injury; joint instability; knee injury; knee meniscus; ligament; male; pathophysiology; regression analysis; skeletal muscle; sport; time; torque; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Cartilage, Articular; Collateral Ligaments; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Muscle, Skeletal; Recovery of Function; Regression Analysis; Sports; Time Factors; Torque","","","","","","","Arangio, George A., Incidence of associated knee lesions with torn anterior cruciate ligament: Retrospective cohort assessment, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 7, 1, pp. 1-8, (1998); Barber-Westin, Sue D., Rigorous statistical reliability, validity, and responsiveness testing of the cincinnati knee rating system in 350 subjects with uninjured, injured, or anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knees, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 4, pp. 402-416, (1999); Bickenbach, Jerome Edmond, Models of disablement, universalism and the international classification of impairments, disabilities and handicaps, Social Science and Medicine, 48, 9, pp. 1173-1187, (1999); Borsa, Paul A., Comparison of performance-based and patient reported measures of function in anterior-cruciate-ligament-deficient individuals, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 28, 6, pp. 392-399, (1998); Borsa, Paul A., Sport-specificity of knee scoring systems to assess disability in anterior cruciate ligament-deficient athletes, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 7, 1, pp. 44-60, (1998); Brosky, Joseph A., Intrarater reliability of selected clinical outcome measures following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 29, 1, pp. 39-48, (1999); Clinical Orthopaedic Rehabilitation, (2003); Cullison, Thomas R., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the military patient, Military Medicine, 163, 1, pp. 17-19, (1998); Elements of Research in Physical Therapy, (1990); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985)","M.D. Ross; Department of Physical Therapy, 208 W.

To determine whether differences in the knee joint movement pattern of a forward lunge could be quantified in healthy subjects and in anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects who were able to return to the same activity level as before their injury (copers) and in those who were not (non-copers). Design. The movement patterns of the injured leg of the coper and non-coper anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects and the right leg of the control subjects were compared statistically. Background. The forward lunge seems to be a less stressful test than the commonly used one-legged hop test, which makes it a possible tool for evaluating and comparing the functional performance of non-copers and copers. Methods. The movement pattern of a forward lunge was analysed by using a two-dimensional inverse dynamics method. The electromyographic activity of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were recorded. Results. The non-copers moved more slowly and loaded the knee joint less than the copers and controls. The copers moved more slowly during the knee flexion phase but as fast as the controls during the knee extension. The EMG results suggest that the copers stabilized their knee joint by increasing the co-contraction of the hamstrings during the extension phase. Conclusions. Differences between the three groups' movement patterns could be quantified. The forward lunge test seems appropriate to discriminate between the knee function in coper and non-coper anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects.","Anterior cruciate ligament deficiency; Electromyography; Functional testing; Inverse dynamics; Movement pattern","Health care; Joints (anatomy); Ligaments; Muscle; Pulmonary diseases; Hamstring; Biomechanics; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; body movement; clinical article; controlled study; electromyography; hamstring; human; joint function; knee; knee injury; male; motor performance; muscle contraction; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electromyography; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Movement","","","","","","This study was funded by the Danish Elite Sport Association (Team Denmark) and the Danish Research Council for Sports.","Kaalund, Sören, Clinical significance of altered gastrocnemius muscle coordination in anterior cruciate ligament‐deficient knees, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, 2, 2, pp. 79-83, (1992); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Branch, Thomas P., Dynamic EMG analysis of anterior cruciate deficient legs with and without bracing during cutting, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 35-41, (1989); Gauffin, Håkan, Altered movement and muscular-activation patterns during the one-legged jump in patients with an old anterior cruciate ligament rupture, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 182-192, (1992); Beard, David John, Gait and electromyographic analysis of anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects, Gait and Posture, 4, 2, pp. 83-88, (1996); DeVita, Paul, Gait adaptations before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 29, 7, pp. 853-859, (1997); Rudolph, Katherine S., 1998 Basmajian Student Award Paper Movement patterns after anterior cruciate ligament injury: A comparison of patients who compensate well for the injury and those who require operative stabilization, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 8, 6, pp. 349-362, (1998); Noyes, Frank R., The symptomatic anterior cruciate-deficient knee.

Ten healthy, non-injured individuals, seven unilateral ACL-deficient individuals and six unilateral ACL-reconstructed individuals were assessed for isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring strength at 1.05 and 3.14 rad.s-1. Peak torque, total work, average power and the ratio of peak torque to body mass were computed for both velocities. Peak torque was also corrected for body mass, using allometric modelling. The non-injured individuals showed significantly greater quadriceps peak torque to body mass ratios than ACL-deficient and ACL-reconstructed individuals at both velocities, and greater hamstring peak torque to body mass ratios than the ACL-deficient group at 3.14 rad.s-1 (P < 0.05). The ACL-deficient individuals displayed greater quadriceps and hamstring peak torque, total work and average power than the non-injured individuals at 1.05 rad.s-1 (P < 0.05). The ACL-deficient individuals also displayed significantly greater peak torque, total work and average power than the ACL-reconstructed individuals for the quadriceps at both velocities (P < 0.05). The ACL-deficient individuals demonstrated greater hamstring peak torque and total work than the non-injured individuals at both velocities (P < 0.05). The allometrically modelled peak torques at both isokinetic velocities demonstrated that the quadriceps muscle values were significantly higher in the non-involved than the involved limb. The hamstring peak torques corrected for body mass were significantly higher in the non-involved than the involved limb only at 1.05 rad.s-1. The main finding from the present study is that isokinetic measures in ratio-scaled or absolute units yield a different outcome and, hence, interpretation compared with the allometric approach.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Isokinetic; Neuromuscular; Strength; Torque","adult; allometry; anterior cruciate ligament; article; body mass; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dynamometry; energy; female; hamstring; human; isokinetic exercise; knee ligament injury; ligament surgery; male; measurement; model; muscle strength; outcomes research; quadriceps femoris muscle; torque; velocity; work; biomechanics; comparative study; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; muscle contraction; muscle isometric contraction; pathophysiology; skeletal muscle; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Comparative Study; Female; Human; Isometric Contraction; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Range of Motion, Articular; Torque; Humans","","","Biodex System II Isokinetic Dynamometer, Biodex","Biodex","","","Barber, Sue D., Quantitative assessment of functional limitations in normal and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 255, pp. 204-214, (1990); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Biodex System II Isokinetic Dynamometer Applications Operations Manual, (1994); Trans Orthop Res Soc, (1991); Carter, N.

Correlations between force platform test variables, quadriceps strength and functional self-report scores were also examined. Results: Each force platform test revealed impaired weight-bearing by either ACLD and/or ACLR subjects. Many variables were correlated to quadriceps strength; therefore, improved strength in ACLR subjects by 6 weeks post-operative negated any weight-bearing impairment. No single force platform variable correlated with the subjects' perception of function. Conclusion: Only the step up/over test provided insight into disability in these patients.

The isokinetic peak torque of the quadriceps muscle was muasured at 60 deg/sec of angular velocity at the same periods. The IKDC form was also used for evaliation. In results, there were no significant differences between two groups concerning each objective parameter. The operation time was significantly shorter in Group S than in Group T. The one-incision technique was obviously superior to the two- incision technique from the viewpoint of cosmesis (small operation scar on the skin). This study demonstrated that both the two-and single-incision techniques are equally useful to reconsteuct the knee stability. We recommend the single-incision technique because of the above-described addutuonal advantage.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Clinical results; Hamstring tendon; Hybrid substitute; Single-incision technique","anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; controlled study; hamstring; human; incision; joint laxity; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; ligament surgery; major clinical study; operation duration; preoperative evaluation; quadriceps femoris muscle; scar formation; surgical technique; treatment outcome; velocity","","","","","","","Arciero, Robert A., Single versus two-incision arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 12, 4, pp. 462-469, (1996); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985); Gerich, Torsten G., One- versus two-incision technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft: Results on early rehabilitation and stability, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 4, pp. 213-216, (1997); Harner, Christopher Dechant, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Endoscopic versus two-incision technique, Arthroscopy, 10, 5, pp. 502-512, (1994); Howell, Stephen M., Comparison of endoscopic and two-incision techniques for reconstructing a torn anterior cruciate ligament using hamstring tendons, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 15, 6, pp. 594-606, (1999); Miyata, Koji, Biomechanical comparisons of anterior cruciate ligament: Reconstruction procedures with flexor tendon graft, Journal of Orthopaedic Science, 5, 6, pp. 585-592, (2000); Reat, J.

The purpose of this study was to assess the extent of bilateral activation deficits and its effect on functional muscle tests using the uninjured leg as reference. The study included 30 patients with isolated rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (group 1), 42 patients with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament and accompanying joint damage (group 2) and 34 healthy volunteers as reference. The maximum isometric knee extension torque and the maximal voluntary muscle activation (VA) were measured bilaterally using a sensitive twitch-interpolation method. The measured and the true functional deficit, adjusted to a physiological VA of the uninjured side, was calculated. Isolated rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament caused a minor VA-deficit and severe knee injuries more severe VA-deficits of the quadriceps muscles of the injured (VA group 1: 83.8 ± 1.9%; group 2: 76.9 ± 1.8%) and on the uninjured side (VA group 1: 85.9 ± 1.8%; group 2: 77.9 ± 1.8%) compared to the control group (VA 91 ± 0.64%). Due to contralateral VA-deficits the mean underestimation of the isometric muscle-force deficit was 22% in group 1 and 48% in group 2. Unilateral knee injuries lead to significant VA-deficits of the quadriceps muscles on both the injured and uninjured legs related to the severity of injury. The validity of tests for the assessment of muscle function is questionable when using the uninjured side as reference.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthrogenous muscle inhibition; Isometric; Maximal voluntary contraction; Torque; Validity","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; controlled study; female; human; knee injury; knee ligament injury; major clinical study; male; muscle contraction; muscle force; muscle isometric contraction; muscle twitch; muscle weakness; quadriceps femoris muscle; skeletal muscle; torque; voluntary movement; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electric Stimulation; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Weakness; Muscle, Skeletal; Rupture; Volition","","","","","","","Allen, Gabrielle M., Reliability of measurements of muscle strength and voluntary activation using twitch interpolation, Muscle & Nerve, 18, 6, pp. 593-600, (1995); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Functional analysis of pre and post-knee surgery: Total knee arthroplasty and ACL reconstruction, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 115, 4, pp. 575-581, (1993); Appelberg, Bo, Excitation of dynamic fusimotor neurones of the cat triceps surae by contralateral joint afferents, Brain Research, 160, 3, pp. 529-532, (1979); Arvidsson, Inga, Isokinetic thigh muscle strength after ligament reconstruction in the knee joint: Results from a 5-10 year follow-up after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee joint, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 1, pp. 7-11, (1981); Awiszus, Friedemann, Influence of stimulus cross talk on results of the twitch-interpolation technique at the biceps brachii muscle, Muscle and Nerve, 20, 9, pp. 1187-1190, (1997); Baugher, W.

Fifty patients, undergoing an ACL reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, were postoperatively allocated randomly to either a plaster cast or a brace for 5 weeks. The brace group had ROM exercises from post-operative day 7. The commencement of ROM exercises was postponed 4 weeks for the plaster group compared to the brace group, but progressed subsequently with equal speed. There was no difference between the groups in the ROM of flexion or extension 20 weeks after the ACL reconstruction and later. Twenty-four months after surgery, the muscle strength deficit in the hamstring muscles (isokinetic measurements; percent difference, injured vs uninjured) was significantly larger in the brace group (mean ± SD: 5.9 ± 7.8%, P < 0.01) than in the plaster group (-0.9 ± 11.8%, NS) (brace vs plaster group, P <0.05). Furthermore, there was also a tendency in the brace group to a larger strength deficit in the quadriceps muscle (brace: 11.1 ± 13.2%, P <0.001; plaster: 3.8 ± 12.9%, NS) (brace vs plaster group, P = 0.07). There was no difference between the groups in the total sagittal knee laxity, as measured with an arthrometer, or in the subjective knee function or activity level (Lysholm score together with the Tegner activity level) between the groups. It is concluded that the postoperative treatment with early range of motion training after ACL reconstruction gave as good ROM, knee stability, subjective knee function and activity level as the treatment with immobilization. It is hypothesized that the larger strength deficit observed after rehabilitation with early range of motion training is secondary to the more intensive training and physical therapist involvement that was demanded in order to achieve full ROM following immobilization.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Early mobilization; Immobilization; Reconstruction; Rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; brace; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; immobilization; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; pathophysiology; plaster cast; plastic surgery; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rupture; skeletal muscle; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Braces; Casts, Surgical; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immobilization; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rupture","","","","","","","Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Andersson, Christer A., Instrumented testing for evaluation of sagittal knee laxity, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 256, pp. 178-184, (1990); Arms, Steven W., The biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation and reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 8-18, (1984); Barber-Westin, Sue D., The effect of rehabilitation and return to activity on anterior-posterior knee displacements after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 264-270, (1993); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain Behavior During Rehabilitation Exercises In Vivo, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 24-34, (1995); Bynum, Edward Bruce, Open Versus Closed Chain Kinetic Exercises After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective Randomized Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 4, pp. 401-406, (1995); Clancy, William G., Anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in rhesus monkeys.

Several methods for graft fixation have been described. To avoid intraarticular hardware we adopt biological fixation with a femoral conical press-fit fixation. A prospective study was performed on 40 consecutive active athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction with this technique by the same surgeon between November 1994 and September 1995 (mean follow-up 46 months, range 36-62). Results were evaluated by an independent examiner using radiography, computed tomography, subjective and objective evaluation, and isokinetic and functional strength tests. Assessment using the IKDC knee scoring revealed 85% of the patients with a normal or nearly normal knee joint; Tegner's score was 7.5 preoperatively and 6.0 postoperatively, with 60% of the athletes returning to the preinjury sport and level. No patients had instability, with 90% having less than 3 mm side-to-side difference on computerized analysis. The isokinetic test showed mild quadriceps deficit at 3 and 6 months, with no deficit at final follow-up; four patients complained of anterior knee pain and had a positive kneeling test. We found no graft dislocation. All cases showed radiological evidence of graft integration at 3 months time. Long-term results support this technique asx a simple, cost-effective, and reliable alternative for patellar tendon fixation in ACL reconstruction.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Fixation ligament; Knee; Patellar tendon; Press fit; Reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; convalescence; female; femur; follow up; human; injury; knee; male; orthopedic equipment; pathophysiology; physiology; plastic surgery; prospective study; radiography; sport injury; tendon; time; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee; Male; Orthopedic Fixation Devices; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Tendons; Time Factors","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Barber-Westin, Sue D., A rigorous comparison between the sexes of results and complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 4, pp. 514-526, (1997); Boszotta, Harald, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft in press-fit technique: Surgical technique and follow-up, Arthroscopy, 13, 3, pp. 332-339, (1997); Brand, Jeff C., Graft fixation in cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 5, pp. 761-774, (2000); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); Am J Knee Surg, (1988); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Fahey, Mark, Bone Tunnel Enlargement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 410-414, (1994); Fink, Christian, Tibial tunnel enlargement following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft, Arthroscopy, 17, 2, pp. 138-143, (2001)","","","","","","","","","09422056","","","11914763","English","Knee Surg.

The deficits were more pronounced for the quadriceps than for the hamstrings, which regained full function at 5 months. Quadriceps performance and thigh circumference were impaired even after 8 months. According to the Lysholm Score, all subjects scored at least as good function and 54% had excellent results. There was a positive correlation between quadriceps performance and both single and triple hops (0.51-0.63), whilst for the harmstrings the correlations were weak (0.32-0.44). We conclude that: 1) Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament injury present quadriceps weakness even after 8 months of the reconstructive surgery using patellar tendon graft; 2) when an isokinetic dynamometer is not available, horizontal impulse tests can be used to evaluate quadriceps deficiency; 3) thigh circumference should not be used as a measurement to predict muscle performance; 4) the Lysholm Score is not sensitive to detect limitations in muscle performance.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; correlation analysis; evaluation; exercise test; hamstring; human; intermethod comparison; isokinetic exercise; joint mobility; knee arthroplasty; knee function; male; motor performance; muscle weakness; patella tendon; postoperative period; prediction; quadriceps femoris muscle; scoring system; tendon graft; thigh","","","","","","","Andriacchi, Thomas P., Functional testing in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 40-47, (1993); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Branch, Thomas P., Dynamic EMG analysis of anterior cruciate deficient legs with and without bracing during cutting, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 35-41, (1989); Principles and Practice of Isokinetics in Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, (1996); DeVita, Paul, Gait adaptations before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 29, 7, pp. 853-859, (1997); Frank, Cyril Basil, The science of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 79, 10, pp. 1556-1576, (1997); Glasgow, Steven G., The effect of early versus late return to vigorous activities on the outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 243-248, (1993); Hargens, Alan Robert, Fluid shifts and muscle function in humans during acute simulated weightlessness, Journal of Applied Physiology Respiratory Environmental and Exercise Physiology, 54, 4, pp. 1003-1009, (1983); Harter, Rod A., Long-term evaluation of knee stability and function following surgical reconstruction for anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 16, 5, pp. 434-443, (1988); Hiemstra, Laurie Anne, Knee strength deficits after hamstring tendo and patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 32, 8, pp. 1472-1479, (2000)","A.C.

Background: It is not known if, following ACL reconstruction, a prolonged reaction time to a sudden stimulus is due to impaired proprioception in the knee joint, a prolonged processing interval in the central nervous system, or a greater elasticity in the series elastic component of the quadriceps femoris. Methods: Seventeen patients were recruited 2 to 3 months following a unilateral ACL reconstruction. Both the involved leg (ACL-invo group) and the uninvolved leg (ACL-uninvo group) were studied. Twenty-two athletes (training group) and 18 control subjects (control group) were also tested. These subjects performed voluntary maximal isometric contraction (MVC) of the quadriceps femoris. Maximal twitch response was also elicited by a supramaximal electrical stimulation to the femoral nerve, and surface electromyograms were recorded from the vastus lateralis in all four groups. Results: Total reaction time for MVC in the ACL-invo group (250.47 ms) was prolonged compared to that of the control and training groups. Twitch response in the ACL-invo group (25.26 ms) was prolonged compared to that of the other three groups. Premotor time during both MVC and twitch response did not differ among the four groups. Electromechanical delay during MVC (53.62 ms) and the evoked electromechanical delay in twitch response (20.04 ms) were prolonged in the ACL-invo group as compared to the other three groups. Conclusions: Prolonged electromechanical delay in twitch response may be due to peripheral physiological disruptions (eg, stiffness of the series elastic component, changes of peripheral muscle fiber-type composition, or a decrease in function of the excitation-contraction coupling process). A prolonged electromechanical delay in twitch response can also explain the prolonged electromechanical delay observed for MVC. These findings suggest that prolonged total reaction time in MVC, when secondary to a visual stimulus in atrophied human quadriceps femoris muscle after ACL reconstruction, may be principally due to prolongation of electromechanical delay produced by peripheral physiological alterations. However, the contribution of premotor time to prolonged total reaction time was not revealed. Our results do not completely eliminate the possibility that central nervous system processing time and other neural factors are involved in the prolongation of reaction time.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Electromechanical delay; Electromyography; Muscle atrophy; Series elastic component","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; central nervous system; controlled study; electrostimulation; excitation contraction coupling; female; human; human experiment; information processing; ligament surgery; male; muscle atrophy; muscle isometric contraction; muscle twitch; normal human; proprioception; quadriceps femoris muscle; reaction time; vastus lateralis muscle","","","","","","","Alexander, R.

This device allows the graft tension to be readjusted after fixation. This device, called a Ligament Tension Screw, consists of three parts, a screw, a washer, and a post. To create the graft, the tendons were formed into a loop. The device was hung from one end of the loop of the graft and a Kennedy-ligament augmentation device (LAD) artificial ligament was hung at the other end. The Kennedy-LAD artificial ligament was used extraarticularly for fixation at the tibia with double staples. Graft tension was increased by turning the screw, which pulls on the post suspending the graft. Fifty-two patients were evaluated after a minimum 2-year follow-up. The evaluation included physical examination, stability measurement with a KT2000 arthrometer, a Cybex muscle strength measurement, a functional test, and scoring of the knee according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC). Pivot test was negative in 47 patients (91%), but glide occurred in 5 patients (9%). No patient had a ""clunk"" or markedly poor result on the pivot test. All patients recovered full extension. Seven patients lost full flexion, but the loss of flexion was less than 5° in all seven. The KT 2000 arthrometer measurement with 133 N anterior drawer force indicated that 46 patients (88%) had less than 3-mm side-to-side difference. The mean muscle strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings was 91% and 94%, respectively, compared with the findings in the contralateral limb. The functional test showed a one-leg hop distance equal to 94% of that the opposite side. According to the final IKDC evaluation, 48 patients were graded as normal or nearly normal, and 4 patients as abnormal; none was severely abnormal. This study demonstrated satisfactory results for the reconstruction with a multistrand hamstring graft fixed with the new Ligament Tension Screw.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Fixation device; Ligament Tension Screw; Reconstruction","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; device; female; graft survival; hamstring; human; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; prosthesis fixation; sport injury; tendon graft","","","Ligament Tension Screw, Nakashima Propeller","Nakashima Propeller","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Amis, Andrew Arthur, Anterior cruciate ligament graft positioning, tensioning and twisting, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, SUPPL. 1, pp. S2-S12, (1998); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Buss, Daniel D., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with use of autogenous patellar-ligament grafts.

No significant differences were noted between groups for Lysholm score, reduction in activity, KT-1000 arthrometer findings, quadriceps muscle size, return to sports, or ability to jump and do hard cuts and pivots. Significantly more patients in the patellar tendon group had patellofemoral pain at 6 months after surgery than did the hamstring tendon patients (48% versus 20%), and at last follow-up the incidence of patellofemoral pain was 42% and 20%, respectively. Fourteen patients in the patellar tendon group and seven in the hamstring tendon group had loss of motion (approximately 5°). Four patients (two in each group) had treatment failures and their results were not included in the clinical examination data. At 2 years' follow-up, 97% of patients with patellar tendon grafts and 100% of patients with hamstring tendon grafts rated their results as good or excellent.

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the patellar tendon was used to determine the width of the tendon and the quality of the tissue. The section of the tendon harvested included 7 to 8 mm of the regenerated tendon and 2 to 3 mm of previously untouched tendon either medial or lateral to the healed tissue. The mean time from primary graft harvest to reharvest was 71.0 ± 44 months (range, 32 to 180). An accelerated rehabilitation program was used postoperatively. Objective follow-up of more than 2 years after surgery was available for 8 patients at a mean of 49.0 ± 15.4 months. The average range of motion in the anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knee was 6/0/133 at 1 month postoperatively and 6/0/145 at long-term follow-up. The mean manual maximum KT-1000 arthrometer difference between knees was 1.6 ± 1.2 mm. The mean isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength of the reharvested graft donor knee was 103% ± 7% of that of the opposite knee. Subjective scores were obtained from 11 patients (12 knees) at a mean of 51.5 ± 35.7 months (range, 24 to 150) after surgery; the mean score was 89.3 ± 6.9 points. We conclude that with appropriate preoperative planning, a reharvested patellar tendon can be used for revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to obtain reliable stability and strength postoperatively.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical article; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; joint stability; knee arthroplasty; knee function; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; reoperation; scoring system; tendon graft; treatment outcome; treatment planning","","","","","","","Burks, Robert T., Biomechanical and histological observations of the dog patellar tendon after removal of its central one-third, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 2, pp. 146-153, (1990); Colosimo, Angelo J., Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a reharvested ipsilateral patellar tendon, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 746-750, (2001); Coupens, Steven D., Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the patellar tendon after use of its central one-third for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 3, pp. 332-335, (1992); Karns, Daniel J., Case report: Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 10, 2, pp. 148-151, (1994); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Ipsi- or contralateral patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament revision surgery.

The subjects consisted of 3 age- and activity-matched groups of 6 subjects: a healthy control group (Ctrl) and 2 groups of patients, with Kenneth-Jones technique using autologous patellar-ligament graft (KJ group) and autologous graft from the semitendinosus tendon (ST group). When compared to the Ctrl group values, each patient group had significant bilateral extension torque deficits in isometric and at slow velocity concentric conditions. In the Op leg, this deficit was associated with lower quadriceps EMG activation. In all tests, bilateral hamstring co-activation level was lower in the patient groups. Flexion torque deficits were observed in the Op leg of both patient groups and in the Nop leg of the KJ group, with minor differences in either hamstring EMG activation or quadriceps co-activation. The inter-leg difference in extension and flexion torques were significant for both patient groups, but only in the isometric strength test, and with no difference in activation. These data demonstrate bilateral knee extension and flexion torque deficits a few months after ACL reconstruction. The observed deficit in quadriceps activation emphasizes the interest to perform combined EMG and strength testings quite early during the rehabilitation period. © 2001 by Human Kinetics and the European College of Sport Science.","ACL; Activation deficit; Co-activation; EMG; Torque deficit","","","","","","","","Kennedy, John C., The anatomy and function of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Movement and muscle activation patterns of 11 copers, ten non-copers and ten uninjured subjects were studied during walking and jogging. Results indicate that distinct gait adaptations appeared primarily in the non-copers. Copers used joint ranges of motion, moments and muscle activation patterns similar to uninjured subjects. Non-copers reduced their knee motion, and external knee flexion moments that correlated well with quadriceps strength. Non-copers also achieved peak hamstring activity later in the weight acceptance phase and used a strategy involving more generalized co-contraction. Both copers and non-copers had high levels of quadriceps femoris muscle activity. The reduced knee moment in the involved limbs of the non-copers did not represent ""quadriceps avoidance"" but rather represented a strategy of general co-contraction with a greater relative contribution from the hamstring muscles.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Dynamic stability; Knee; Quadriceps avoidance","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; electromyography; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; knee injury; male; movement (physiology); pathophysiology; physiology; rupture; skeletal muscle; thigh; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Range of Motion, Articular; Rupture; Thigh","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (T32HD007490); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","","Beard, David John, Reflex hamstring contraction latency in anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 12, 2, pp. 219-228, (1994); Benedetti, MG Grazia, Myoelectric activation pattern during gait in total knee replacement: Relationship with kinematics, kinetics, and clinical outcome, IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering, 7, 2, pp. 140-149, (1999); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Ciccotti, Michael G., An Electromyographic Analysis of the Knee During Functional Activities: II.

A group of patients after ACL-reconstruction was examined in an isometric strength test on an isokinetic system linked with EMG. 12 patients received actual acupuncture. After tonifying stimulation of two acupuncture points (St 32 -Futu- and St 36 -Zusanli-) the involved atrophic M. quadriceps femoris showed a highly significant increase in EMG-amplitudes (on average 46% up to more than 60%) and maximum strength values (18%) as well as significantly higher medianfrequencies in the first 10 seconds of the retest. A second group receiving placebo acupuncture and a control group without acupuncture treatment of 8 patients each did not show any differences in the retest. The use of acupuncture in rehabilitative strength training effects a better excitability in tonifying muscle function.

We examined whether a deficit of voluntary activation (VA) of the quadriceps muscle can be reversed by reconstruction of the ACL and assessed its influence on muscle strength and clinical parameters. We evaluated 12 male subjects with an isolated tear of the ACL and 12 matched control subjects before operation and two years after reconstruction of the ACL. Assessment included measurements of isometric knee-extension torque at maximal voluntary contraction (MVC force), knee stability tests, the International Knee Ligament Standard Evaluation Form and the Tegner activity score. A sensitive method of twitch interpolation was used to quantify the VA and to calculate true muscle force. Before operation we found a deficit of VA on both the injured (mean ±SEM 74.9 ± 3.5%) and the uninjured side (74.6 ± 3.0%) in comparison with the control group (91 ± 0.9%). Two years after reconstruction of the ACL the VA improved significantly on both sides but remained less than that of the controls. Correlation analysis revealed an improvement of the VA in patients who returned to a higher level of activity. The deficit of true muscle force, however, persisted regardless of the clinical outcome and ligament stability.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; calculation; clinical article; controlled study; correlation function; human; knee function; knee instability; ligament surgery; male; measurement; muscle force; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; muscle twitch; muscle weakness; outcomes research; priority journal; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; torque; voluntary movement","","","","","","","Kannus, Pekka A., Incidence of knee injuries and the need for further care.

Objectives: To quantify the effect of different levels of isokinetic concentric and eccentric knee extensor torques on the anterior tibial translation in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency. Electromyogram (EMG) activity of 4 leg muscles was recorded in order to detect any co-activation of extensors and flexors. Background: The rehabilitation after an ACL injury is of importance for the functional outcome of the patient. In order to construct a rehabilitation program after that injury, it is important to understand the in vivo relationships between muscle force and tibial translation. Methods and Measures: Twelve patients with unilateral ACL injury and 11 uninjured volunteers performed 36 repetitions of a quadriceps contraction at different isokinetic concentric and eccentric torque levels, on a KinCom machine (60°·s-1), with simultaneous recordings of tibial translation (CA-4000) and EMG activity from quadriceps and hamstrings muscles. Tibial translations and EMG levels were normalized to the maximum of each subject. Results: The individual anterior tibial translation increased with increased quadriceps torque in a similar manner in both quadriceps contraction modes in all legs tested. During concentric mode, translation was similar in all groups, but during eccentric mode, the mean translation was 38% larger in the ACL injured knees. No quadriceps-hamstrings co-activation occurred in any test or group. Conclusions: An ACL deficient knee can limit the translation within a normal space during concentric muscle activity but not during eccentric activity. That limitation depends on other mechanisms than hamstrings co-activation.","Concentric contraction; Eccentric contraction; Knee kinematics; Rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; electromyogram; female; hamstring; human; isokinetic exercise; kinesiology; knee function; knee ligament injury; leg muscle; male; muscle force; muscle isometric contraction; quadriceps femoris muscle; tibia; torque","","","","","","","Antonopoulos, J., Anterior tibial translation related to isokinetic concentric quadriceps torques, Isokinetics and Exercise Science, 6, 2, pp. 145-151, (1996); Arms, Steven W., The biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation and reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 8-18, (1984); Baratta, Richard V., Muscular coactivation.

Measurements were made during an active extension exercise with 0-, 4-, and 8-kg weights and during squats on two legs and on one leg where the projection of the center of gravity was placed over, behind, and in front the feet. In the uninjured subjects, tibial translation increased with increasing load except during the squat with the center of gravity behind the feet, which produced the smallest translation. For the active extension exercises, translation was greater during eccentric activity. In the anterior cruciate ligament-injured knees, all squats resulted in similar translation, which was smaller than that during the active extension exercise. The highest muscle activation was seen during squats. Hamstring muscle activity was low. Increased static laxity in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee can be controlled during closed but not during open kinetic chain exercises. Coactivation of the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles seems to be important for knee stability, whereas hamstring muscle coactivation was insignificant. To minimize sagittal translation during nonoperative management of anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, closed kinetic chain exercises are preferable to open kinetic chain exercises, and importance should be attached to the spontaneous coactivation of the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles.","","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; electromyogram; female; gastrocnemius muscle; goniometry; human; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; male; muscle contraction; muscle exercise; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; tibia","","","","","","","Antonopoulos, J., Anterior tibial translation related to isokinetic concentric quadriceps torques, Isokinetics and Exercise Science, 6, 2, pp. 145-151, (1996); Baratta, Richard V., Muscular coactivation.

Methods: In 12 ACL-def patients and 17 controls, sagittal tibial translation was registered with the CA-4000 electrogoniometer during level walking, cutting, and stair walking. Tibial position at each flexion angle was expressed relative to the femuro-tibial position at passive knee extension. EMG activity, measured with ME-4000, was normalized to the individual maximum isometric voluntary contraction for each muscle. Results: During the weight-bearing phase of motion, the tibia was anteriorly positioned in all legs. In the injured leg, the tibia translated more rapidly to an anterior position that was maintained for a longer time during the gait cycle. In the noninjured knees, motions with increased load lead to an increased anterior tibial translation in contrast to the injured knees, where the maximum displacement was already reached during level walking. The quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were simultaneously active during stance phase. Hamstrings were mainly active when the knee was close to extension and translation increased in spite of this activity. Conclusions: The mechanism of the anterior positioning of tibia is qualitatively similar in the normal and the injured knee, but that position is obtained much further forward in the ACL deficient knee. Quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles seem to work synergistically to stabilize the knee by maintaining the anterior position of tibia during weight-bearing motion. The role of hamstrings to restrict anterior translation is questioned.","EMG; Knee kinematics; Level walking; Rehabilitation; Stair walking; Tibial translation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; controlled study; electromyogram; female; gait; gastrocnemius muscle; goniometry; hamstring; human; knee function; leg movement; male; quadriceps femoris muscle; tibia; vastus lateralis muscle; vastus medialis muscle; walking; weight bearing","","","","","","","Antonopoulos, J., Anterior tibial translation related to isokinetic concentric quadriceps torques, Isokinetics and Exercise Science, 6, 2, pp. 145-151, (1996); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthrometric evaluation of knees that have a torn anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 9, pp. 1299-1306, (1990); Beard, David John, Gait and electromyographic analysis of anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects, Gait and Posture, 4, 2, pp. 83-88, (1996); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Buss, Daniel D., Nonoperative Treatment of Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in a Selected Group of Patients, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 2, pp. 160-165, (1995); Butler, David L., Ligamentous restraints to anterior-posterior drawer in the human knee.

The aim of ACL-reconstruction is to achieve normal function of the knee by using different approaches and grafts. Methods: The results of fifty patients who had had a reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) through a small arthrotomy, with the use of the central third of an autogenous, bone-patellar tendon-bone free graft, at King Hussein Medical Center, between the years 1994-1997, were reviewed retrospectively. Forty five (90%) patients were active soldiers between the ages of 20-30 years. The average time between injury and operation was 27 months (1-72). The analysis of causes of injury revealed that 50% were sport injuries (contact and non-contact), 46% due to fall and twisting injuries. All patients presented with knee pain, recurrent swelling, and giving way either partial or full. Twenty eight (56%) knees had an associated meniscal injury. The patients had an aggressive rehabilitation program advocated by Shelbourne and Nitz, aiming for early restoration and maintenance of movement and strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings. The patients were evaluated by clinical examination, radiological assessment, subjective questionnaire, and the functional status was evaluated according to the scoring scale of Lysholm and Gilliquist. Results: Based on the above scoring system we found that 45(90%) knees were graded as excellent or good and no longer gave way. Full motion (0-135 degree) was restored in all knees except in two who had restriction of flexion. No evidence of degenerative changes were seen except in one patient who developed late infection. The unsolved problem of anterior knee pain developed in ten (20%) patients. Conclusion: This procedure, with the patient's cooperation and understanding of the rehabilitation program, yielded results similar to those of other procedures.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthrotomy; article; clinical article; clinical examination; clinical feature; functional assessment; hamstring; human; knee function; knee meniscus rupture; ligament surgery; male; operation duration; patella tendon; quadriceps femoris muscle; questionnaire; radiodiagnosis; retrospective study; scoring system; surgical approach; surgical technique","","","","","","","Sandberg, Rolf, Operative versus non-operative treatment of recent injuries to the ligaments of the knee.

One of the original 125 patients was excluded from the present study because of insufficient follow-up, and an additional group of 101 patients was added. All 225 patients in the present study were followed for a minimum of six years. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to reconstruction with a double-stranded semitendinosus-gracilis graft with use of a two-incision technique (group I), reconstruction with a patellar ligament graft with use of a two-incision technique (group II), or reconstruction with a patellar ligament graft with use of a single-incision endoscopic technique (group III). The groups were compared with regard to the rate of graft failure, the amount of instability, knee strength, radiographic signs of degenerative changes, and functional outcome. Results: There was no significant difference among the three groups with regard to the rate of graft failure, the amount of knee instability, or the functional outcome. A normal or nearly normal functional outcome was recorded for 208 (92%) of the 225 patients. There were significant differences among the groups with regard to quadriceps muscle-strength deficits: group I had fewer patients with deficits than group III, and groups I and III both had fewer patients with deficits than group II (p = 0.04). There also were significant differences among the groups with regard to hamstring muscle-strength deficits: group III had fewer patients with deficits than group II, and group II had fewer patients with deficits than group I (p < 0.01). Twelve knees (16%) in group I, six knees (8%) in group II, and eight knees (11%) in group III showed radiographic evidence of progressive degenerative changes, but the differences among the three groups were not significant. Conclusion: Although 11.6% of the 225 knees had radiographic evidence of degenerative arthritis at a minimum of six years after arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, the choice of graft and the technique of reconstruction did not seem to affect the rate of development of these changes.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; controlled study; endoscopic surgery; female; follow up; graft failure; human; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; osteoarthritis; priority journal; surgical technique; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); O'Neill, Daniel B., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A prospective randomized analysis of three techniques, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 78, 6, pp. 803-813, (1996); Shelbourne, K.

The contralateral normal knees were used as controls. Images were obtained with the quadriceps muscles at rest (knee flexion at 40°, 25°, and 10°) and with the quadriceps muscles contracted (knee flexion at 40° and 25°). When the quadriceps muscles were at rest there were no differences in patellar alignment between the anterior cruciate ligament-injured knees and the contralateral normal knees. When the quadriceps muscles were maximally contracted at 40° of flexion, the patellae of the anterior cruciate ligament-injured knees tilted laterally 3.6° relative to the resting state. When the quadriceps muscles were contracted at 25° of flexion, the patellae of the anterior cruciate ligament-injured knees tilted laterally approximately 4° relative to the resting state. Quadriceps-active lateral patellar tilt at 25° of flexion was greater in the anterior cruciate ligament-injured knees than in the contralateral normal knees, and it correlated with instrumented measurements of anterior tibial translation. Dynamic lateral patellar tilt during open kinetic chain exercises and during other activities that produce anterior tibial translation may contribute to extensor mechanism dysfunction in the anterior cruciate ligament-injured knee.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; exercise; female; human; knee function; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella; patella dislocation; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","","","","","Andriacchi, Thomas P., Functional testing in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 40-47, (1993); Orthop Trans, (1991); Martin Bland, J., STATISTICAL METHODS FOR ASSESSING AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO METHODS OF CLINICAL MEASUREMENT, The Lancet, 327, 8476, pp. 307-310, (1986); Brossmann, Johachim, Patellar tracking patterns during active and passive knee extension: Evaluation with motion-triggered cine MR imaging, Radiology, 187, 1, pp. 205-212, (1993); Buss, Daniel D., Nonoperative Treatment of Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in a Selected Group of Patients, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 2, pp. 160-165, (1995); Bynum, Edward Bruce, Open Versus Closed Chain Kinetic Exercises After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective Randomized Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 4, pp. 401-406, (1995); Knee Ligaments Structure Function Injury and Repair, (1990); Delgado-Martins, Henrique, A study of the position of the patella using computerised tomography, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 61, 4, pp. 443-444, (1979); Orthop Trans, (1992); Orthop Trans, (1987)","","","American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","11573918","English","Am.

Nineteen patients were recruited 2-3 months following a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Both the involved leg as well as the uninvolved leg were studied. Maximal twitch response was elicited and surface electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from the vastus lateralis. Total reaction time (TRT) for both MVC and twitch on involved leg was prolonged (251.47 msec, 26.01 msec). This prolongation suggests an extended lag in avoiding injury such as during sports. Pre-motor time during both MVC and twitch (PMTmvc, PMTtwitch) did not differ between both groups. Electromechanical delay during MVC (EMDmvc) was prolonged on involved leg (53.42 msec), and also evoked twitch EMD (EMDtwitch) (20.04 msec) as compared to the opposit side. Prolonged EMDtwitch may be due to a decrease in stiffness of the series elastic component, changes of peripheral muscle composition to containing more slow type muscle fibers, or a decrease in function of the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling process. A prolonged EMDtwitch can also explain the prolonged EMDmvc. These findings also suggested that prolonged TRTmvc to visual stimulus during MVC in atrophied human quadriceps femoris muscle after disuse was principally due to prolongation of EMDmvc. Prolonged EMDmvc may have resulted from decreased muscle stiffness, which was evident in the prolongation of the EMDtwitch.","Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Disuse; Electromechanical delay; Electromyography","anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; electrophysiology; female; human; male; muscle atrophy; muscle isometric contraction; pathophysiology; photostimulation; reaction time; skeletal muscle; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Electrophysiology; Female; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Atrophy; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time","","","","","","","Alexander, R.

The results were compared to a previously investigated group of patients after isolated ACL-rupture and to an aged-matched control group. The patients with extensive knee injuries presented a significant higher deficit of voluntary quadriceps muscle activation on the injured (78.8±2.09%, mean±SEM) and equally on the uninjured side (78.9±1.91%) compared to the patients after isolated ACL-rupture and to controls. A minor MVC-deficit of the patients quadriceps muscle of the uninjured side could be explained by the voluntary activation deficit alone, the major MVC deficit of the injured side by muscle atrophy and a voluntary activation deficit. The activation deficit is probably the underlying reason for persisting muscle wasting and weakness despite intensive physiotherapy especially in patients with concomitant injuries in addition to an ACL-rupture.","ACL-rupture; Muscle function; Quadriceps muscle; Twitch interpolation; Voluntary activation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; case report; controlled study; human; human cell; human tissue; knee injury; male; muscle atrophy; muscle contractility; muscle weakness; quadriceps femoris muscle; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Muscular Atrophy; Neural Inhibition; Postoperative Complications","","","","","","","Allen, Gabrielle M., Reliability of measurements of muscle strength and voluntary activation using twitch interpolation, Muscle & Nerve, 18, 6, pp. 593-600, (1995); Appelberg, Bo, Excitation of dynamic fusimotor neurones of the cat triceps surae by contralateral joint afferents, Brain Research, 160, 3, pp. 529-532, (1979); Arvidsson, Inga, Isokinetic thigh muscle strength after ligament reconstruction in the knee joint: Results from a 5-10 year follow-up after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee joint, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 1, pp. 7-11, (1981); Awiszus, Friedemann, Influence of stimulus cross talk on results of the twitch-interpolation technique at the biceps brachii muscle, Muscle and Nerve, 20, 9, pp. 1187-1190, (1997); Baugher, W.

Researchers study ACL-deficient individuals in order to identify movement strategies in the absence of a major knee stabilizer, thereby providing information to clinicians regarding treatment options. Single-leg hops represent an activity which places higher demands on the knee than walking or jogging. Hops are thought by some to represent demands that are more comparable to those found during high level sports. Therefore hopping might provide more information about knee stability during dynamic activities than less strenuous activities. This paper reflects one component of a larger study involving comparisons of joint motions and muscle activity patterns in uninjured individuals (n=10) and two groups of athletes who had complete ACL ruptures; one group had substantial knee instability (noncopers, n=10), and the other had no signs of knee instability (copers, n=11). In this paper we report the findings from the single-leg hop activity. The results indicate that coper subjects move in a manner nearly identical to uninjured persons. Kinetic data suggest that copers stabilize their knees with greater contributions from the ankle extensor muscles. Muscle activity data demonstrate that there is no reduction in quadriceps femoris activity in the coper subjects. In the group of ten subjects with knee instability (noncopers) who participated in the over-all study involving walking, jogging, hopping, and a step activity only four were willing to hop. Work in our laboratory has established that when high level athletes rupture their ACL, the majority of them cannot return to high level sports. The small number of noncopers in this study who were willing to hop supports our previous findings. Those noncopers who did hop displayed reduced knee range of motion and external knee flexion moments, a movement strategy remarkably similar to that found during other activities. Neither the copers nor the noncopers showed evidence that quadriceps activation was diminished.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Electromyography; Hop; Kinematics; Kinetics","adult; ankle; anterior cruciate ligament; article; electromyography; female; hip; human; injury; joint instability; knee; knee injury; male; movement (physiology); pathophysiology; rupture; skeletal muscle; Adult; Ankle Joint; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electromyography; Female; Hip Joint; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Rupture","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (1RO3HD3554701); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (T32HD007490); Foundation for Physical Therapy, FPT, (97D12RUD01); National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, (396E001)","Acknowledgements This project was supported by the National Institutes of Health (Training Grant 5T32HD7490, Grant 1RO3HD3554701) the National Athletic Training Association (Grant 396E001), and the Foundation for Physical Therapy (Doctoral Research Award 97D12RUD01).","Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Ciccotti, Michael G., An Electromyographic Analysis of the Knee During Functional Activities: II.

We studied anterior knee laxity, thigh muscle torque, and return to preinjury sports level in 44 patients with unilateral ACL; group 1 carried out quadriceps strengthening only with CKC while group 2 trained with CKC plus OKC exercises starting from week 6 after surgery. Anterior knee laxity was determined with a KT-1000 arthrometer; isokinetic concentric and eccentric quadriceps and hamstring muscle torque were studied with a Kin-Com dynamometer before and 6 months after surgery. At an average of 31 months after surgery the patients answered a questionnaire regarding their current knee function and physical activity/sports to determine the extent and timing of their recovery. No significant differences in anterior knee laxity were noted between the groups 6 months postsurgery. Patients in group 2 increased their quadriceps torque significantly more than those in group 1, but no differences were found in hamstring torque between the groups. A significantly higher number of patients in group 2 (n=12) than in group 1 (n=5) returned to sports at the same level as before the injury (P<0.05). Patients from group 2 who returned to sports at the same level did so 2 months earlier than those in group 1. Thus the addition of OKC quadriceps training after ACL reconstruction results in a significantly better improvement in quadriceps torque without reducing knee joint stability at 6 months and also leads to a significantly higher number of athletes returning to their previous activity earlier and at the same level as before injury.","ACL reconstruction; ACL rehabilitation; Anterior knee laxity; Closed kinetic chain; Isokinetic open kinetic chain","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; injury; joint instability; kinesiotherapy; knee injury; male; methodology; physiology; randomized controlled trial; skeletal muscle; thigh; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Exercise Therapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Thigh","","","","","","","Anderson, Allen F., Instrumented evaluation of knee laxity: A comparison of five arthrometers, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 135-140, (1992); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain Behavior During Rehabilitation Exercises In Vivo, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 24-34, (1995); Beynnon, Bruce D., The strain behavior of the anterior cruciate ligament during squatting and active flexion-extension.

Isokinetic peak torque, angle to peak moment of quadriceps (Q) and hamstring (H), and hamstrings/quadriceps ratio (HQR) were measured. There was a significant decline in the mean strength of Q at 60°/s for the involved side compared with either the uninvolved side or with that of the healthy subjects, but not in H. There was also a significant decrease in mean Q strength at 180°/s of the involved side of ACL patients compared with the healthy young males. There was a significant difference in mean angle to peak moment of Q at 180°/s in the healthy group compared with the involved side of the patients and a significant difference for the same parameter in H at 60°/s in the involved compared with the healthy group and uninvolved sides of the ACL patients. There was no significant difference in hamstrings/quadriceps ratio between the groups. It was concluded that the effect of ACL tear on H strength is significantly less than that on the Q one year post-injury. Angle to peak moment offers original and practical information for the determination of individual performance in post ACL injury patients.","Angle to peak moment; Isokinetics; Peak torque; Quadriceps/hamstrings ratio","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; hamstring; human; human tissue; knee function; knee ligament injury; male; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; steady state","","","Biodex 2 isokinetic dynamometer, Shirley Aldred","Shirley Aldred","","","Isokinetics Muscle Testing Interpretation and Clinical Applications, (1995); Dvir, Zeevi, Thigh muscle activity and anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, Clinical Biomechanics, 4, 2, pp. 87-91, (1989); Tegner, Yelverton, Strengthening exercises for old cruciate ligament tears, Acta Orthopaedica, 57, 2, pp. 130-134, (1986); Natri, Antero, Isokinetic Muscle Performance after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery: Long-Term Results and Outcome Predicting Factors after Primary Surgery and Late-Phase Reconstruction, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 3, pp. 223-228, (1996); Reat, J.

Several studies have demonstrated that patients with knee injury scored within a normal range during one-legged hop tests yet showed quadriceps femoris muscle weakness with non-weight-bearing isokinetic testing. This study evaluated lower-extremity kinetics while subjects performed a single-leg vertical jump (VJ) and a lateral step-up (LSU) in an attempt to explain this phenomenon. Subjects and Methods. Using a motion analysis and force platform system, hip, knee, and ankle extension moments of 20 subjects with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions and 20 matched subjects were measured while they performed an LSU and a VJ. Results. An analysis of variance revealed that the knee extension moment of the ACL- reconstructed extremity was lower than that of the uninjured and matched extremities during the LSU, VJ take-off, and VJ landing. However, there was no difference in summated extension moment (hip + knee + ankle) among extremities during the LSU and VJ take-off. The summated extension moment of the ACL-reconstructed extremity during VJ landing was less than that of the uninvolved and matched extremities. Conclusions and Discussion. These results suggest that the hip or ankle extensors may compensate for the knee extension moment deficit. The decrease in summated extension moment in the ACL- reconstructed extremity during VJ landing represents inadequate attenuation of landing forces, which may expose the skeleton and joint structures to injury.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Compensations; Functional tests; Lower-extremity kinetics","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; data analysis; female; functional assessment; human; isokinetic exercise; knee injury; ligament surgery; male; muscle weakness; quadriceps femoris muscle; reliability; scoring system; weight bearing","","","","","","","Johnson, Robert J., The anterior cruciate ligament problem, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 172, pp. 14-18, (1983); Fu, Freddie H., Anterior cruciate ligament surgery 1996: State of the art?, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 325, pp. 19-24, (1996); Liljedahl, Sten Otto, Early diagnosis and treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament; a clinical and arthrographic study of forty-eight cases., The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Kelley, ; Axe, Michael J., ; Snyder-Mackler, Lynn, ","Background and Purpose. Treatment techniques involving perturbations of support surfaces may induce compensatory muscle activity that could improve knee stability and increase the likelihood of returning patients to high- level physical activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of augmenting standard nonoperative anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rehabilitation programs with a perturbation training program. Subjects. Twenty-six patients with an acute ACL injury or ruptures of ACL grafts participated in the study. Subjects had to have a unilateral ACL injury, be free of concomitant multiple ligament or meniscal damage requiring surgical repair, and pass a screening examination designed to identify patients who had the potential to return to high-level physical activity with nonoperative treatments. Subjects also had to be regular participants in level I activities (eg, soccer, football, basketball) or level II activities (eg, racquet sports, skiing, construction work). Methods. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a group that received a standard rehabilitation program (standard group) or a group that received the standard program augmented with a perturbation training program (perturbation group). Treatment outcome was determined from scores on the Knee Outcome Survey's Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS) and Sports Activity Scale, a global rating of knee function, scores on a series of single-limb hop tests, measurements of maximum isometric quadriceps femoris muscle force output, and the group frequency of unsuccessful rehabilitation. Unsuccessful rehabilitation was defined as the occurrence of an episode of giving way of the knee or failure to maintain the functional status of a rehabilitation candidate on retesting. Results. More subjects had unsuccessful rehabilitation in the standard group compared with the perturbation group. There was a within-group x time interaction for the ADLS, global rating of knee function, and crossover hop test scores. These scores decreased from posttraining to the 6-month follow- up for the standard group. Conclusion and Discussion. Although both the standard program and the perturbation training program may allow subjects to return to high-level physical activity, the perturbation training program appears to reduce the risk of continued episodes of giving way of the knee during athletic participation, and it allows subjects to maintain their functional status for longer periods.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Knee; Rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; athlete; clinical article; clinical trial; conservative treatment; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; daily life activity; female; follow up; human; knee function; male; muscle exercise; muscle isometric contraction; muscle training; physical activity; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; sport; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Ciccotti, Michael G., Non-operative treatment of ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament in middle-aged patients.

The contralateral group had statistically significantly more flexion than the ipsilateral group at 1 week and 2 weeks postoperatively. The contralateral group had statistically significantly greater quadriceps muscle strength in the reconstructed knee at 1, 2, and 4 months post-operatively and in the donor knee at 1 and 2 months postoperatively. Mean KT-1000 arthrometer results were 1.9 ± 1.3 mm for the contralateral group and 2.2 ± 1.1 mm for the ipsilateral group. The mean time to return to sports at full capability in a competitive subgroup was 4.1 months for contralateral patients and 5.5 months for ipsilateral patients. Overall, 49% of patients in the contralateral group and 12% of patients in the ipsilateral group returned to their preinjury levels of activity by 4 months postoperatively. Our results indicate that the contralateral patellar tendon can be used to restore range of motion and strength sooner than an ipsilateral patellar tendon graft. Patients can also have a faster return to full capability in sports without compromising ultimate stability.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; female; human; knee function; knee instability; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); de Carlo, Mark S., Rehabilitation program for both knees when the contralateral autogenous patellar tendon graft is used for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A case study, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 29, 3, pp. 144-159, (1999); Engebretsen, Lars, A prospective, randomized study of three surgical techniques for treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 6, pp. 585-590, (1990); Graf, Ben K., Complications of intra-articular anterior cruciate reconstruction., Clinics in sports medicine, 7, 4, pp. 835-848, (1988); Lephart, Scott M., Quadriceps strength and functional capacity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Patellar tendon autograft versus allograft, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 5, pp. 738-743, (1993); Marder, Richard A., Prospective evaluation of arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

The tibial translation increased in a linear fashion with a mean of 0.5 mm per 20% torque increase. In 20° of knee flexion, 10% of eccentric quadriceps peak torque consumed 80% of the anterior tibial translation induced by the 90 N Lachman test while eccentric quadriceps peak torque utilized 100% of the translation at the same test. The in vivo relation between muscle force and tibial translation is of importance in the treatment of patients with injury to the cruciate ligaments. The results indicate that an already low eccentric quadriceps torque causes a tibial translation that reaches the limit of the passive knee joint displacement where strain is assumed to develop in the anterior cruciate ligament. Already low eccentric quadriceps torque levels may therefore be harmful during rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament surgery.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomechanics; Knee joint; Muscle contraction","adult; article; biomechanics; female; human; knee; male; physiology; skeletal muscle; thigh; tibia; weight bearing; Adult; Biomechanics; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Thigh; Tibia; Weight-Bearing","","","","","","","Lysholm, Marketta, Sagittal plane translation of the tibia in anterior cruciate ligament‐deficient knees during commonly used rehabilitation exercises, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, 5, 1, pp. 49-56, (1995); Lutz, Gregory E., Comparison of tibiofemoral joint forces during open-kinetic-chain and closed-kinetic-chain exercises, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 75, 5, pp. 732-739, (1993); Wilk, Kevin E., A comparison of tibiofemoral joint forces and electromyographic activity during open and closed kinetic chain exercises, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 4, pp. 518-527, (1996); Ericson, Mats O., Tibiofemoral joint forces during ergometer cycling, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 4, pp. 285-290, (1986); Kaufman, Kenton R., Dynamic joint forces during knee isokinetic exercise, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 3, pp. 305-316, (1991); Antonopoulos, J., Anterior tibial translation related to isokinetic concentric quadriceps torques, Isokinetics and Exercise Science, 6, 2, pp. 145-151, (1996); Faulkner, John A., Injury to skeletal muscle fibers during contractions: Conditions of occurrence and prevention, Physical Therapy, 73, 12, pp. 911-921, (1993); Lieber, Richard L., Skeletal muscle mechanics: Implications for rehabilitation, Physical Therapy, 73, 12, pp. 844-856, (1993); Basic Biomechanics of the Musculoskeletal System, (1989); Colliander, Erland B., Effects of eccentric and concentric muscle actions in resistance training, Acta Physiologica Scandinavica, 140, 1, pp. 31-39, (1990)","","","","","","","","","09057188","","SMSSE","10407925","English","Scand.

All MCL injuries were treated non-operatively. In 27 patients (group I) we performed early ACL reconstruction (within the first 3 weeks after injury). The postoperative rehabilitation protocol included brace treatment for all patients over a period of 6 weeks. In 37 patients we performed late ACL reconstruction (after a minimum of 10 weeks). In this group initial non-operative MCL treatment (6 weeks brace treatment) was followed by a period of accelerated rehabilitation. Patients with late ACL reconstruction had a lower rate of loss of motion after finishing the postoperative rehabilitation programme and a lower rate of re-arthroscopies for a loss of extension (group I: 4 patients, group II: 1 patient). The difference in the mean quadriceps muscle strength (group I: 83.3%, group II: 86.3%) was not statistically significant. After a mean interval of 22 months, we saw no difference in the frequency of anterior or medial instabilities or in the loss of motion. The Lysholm score was significantly better in the group with late ACL reconstruction (group I: 85.3, group II: 89.9). The position on the Tegner activity scale decreased in both groups, to 5.5 in group I (preoperatively: 6.0) and to 5.6 in group II (preoperatively: 5.9). With regard to the lower rate of motion complications in the early postoperative period, the lower rate of re-arthroscopies, and the significantly better results in the Lysholm score, we prefer late ACL reconstruction in the treatment of combined injuries of the ACL and the MCL.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; brace; female; human; knee ligament injury; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; retrospective study; time; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Cats; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Knee Injuries; Male; Medial Collateral Ligament, Knee; Middle Aged; Multiple Trauma; Pain Measurement; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors","","","","","","","Andersson, Christer A., Treatment of acute isolated and combined ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament: A long-term follow-up study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 7-12, (1992); Ballmer, Peter Matthias, The non operative treatment of isolated complete tears of the medial collateral ligament of the knee - A Prospective Study, Archives of Orthopaedic and Traumatic Surgery, 107, 5, pp. 273-276, (1988); Benedetto, Karl Peter, The ""gold standard"" in cruciate ligament replacement, Der Chirurg; Zeitschrift für alle Gebiete der operativen Medizen, 66, 11, pp. 1061-1070, (1995); Dandy, David J., Problems in regaining full extension of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does arthrofibrosis exist?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 2, 2, pp. 76-79, (1994); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Aaos Meeting, (1997); Ellsasser, James C., The non operative treatment of collateral ligament injuries of the knee in professional football players.

Lab., University of Pittsburgh Musculoskeletal Research Center, Pittsburgh, PA, United States","Objective: The high incidence of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in females has attracted research to investigate the capacity of muscles to reflexively protect the knee joint from capsuloligamentous injury. Numerous reflex pathways link mechanoreceptors in the ACL with contractile fibers in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. Loads placed on the ACL modify reactive muscle activity through the feedback process of neuromuscular control and are critical for dynamic muscular stabilization. Noncontact ACL injuries may be the result of aberrations in reactive muscle firing patterns. Therefore, compensatory muscle activation strategies must be employed if functional stability is to be restored after injury or surgical reconstruction. The purpose of our study was to compare the amplitude of reactive muscle activity in females with ACL-deficient (ACLD), ACL-reconstructed (ACLR), and control knees during functional activities. Design and Setting: Female volunteer subjects were stratified into groups based on the status of their ACLs. Each subject performed 4 functional activities, bilaterally, during a single test session. Subjects: Twenty-four female subjects participated in this study (ACLD = 6, ACLR = 12, control = 6). Measurements: Integrated electromyographic (IEMG) data were collected with surface electrodes from the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, medial hamstring, and lateral hamstring during downhill walking (15°, 0.92 m/s), level running (2.08 m/s), and hopping and landing from a jump (20.3 cm). IEMG was normalized to the mean amplitude of 3 to 6 consecutive test repetitions. The mean area and peak IEMG of a 250-millisecond period after ground contact was used to represent reactive muscle activity. Side-to-side differences were determined using dependent t tests, and group differences were determined using a one-way analysis of variance. Results: During running, the ACLD group demonstrated significantly greater area and peak IEMG activity in the medial hamstring in comparison with the ACLR group and greater peak activity in the lateral hamstring when compared with the control group. The ACLD group also demonstrated greater peak activity in the vastus medialis and a smaller area of IEMG activity in the lateral hamstring than the control group during running. During landing, the ACLD group demonstrated significantly less area of IEMG activity in the vastus lateralis when compared with the control group. No significant differences were identified between the ACLR and control groups, nor were side-to side differences revealed. Conclusions: Our results suggest that adaptations occur in the reactive muscle activity of ACLD females during functional activities. Strategies to minimize the anterior tibial translation in response to joint loading included increased hamstring activity and quadriceps inhibition. The reactive muscle activity exhibited in ACLD subjects is presumably an attempt to regain functional stability through the dynamic restraint mechanism. The absence of side-to-side differences suggests that these adaptations occur bilaterally after ACL injury.","Muscle activity; Reflex","","","","","","","","Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Branch, Thomas P., Dynamic EMG analysis of anterior cruciate deficient legs with and without bracing during cutting, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 35-41, (1989); McNair, Peter John, Landing characteristics in subjects with normal and anterior cruciate ligament deficient knee joints, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 75, 5, pp. 584-589, (1994); Solomonow, Moshe, The synergistic action of the anterior cruciate ligament and thigh muscles in maintaining joint stability, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 207-213, (1987); Beard, David John, Proprioception after rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Design and Setting: A 2 × 2 mixed-design analysis of variance (group × leg) was applied to the static posture, dynamic balance, and strength data. In addition, Pearson product-moment correlations were calculated to determine the strength of the relationships among the dependent measures. All data were collected in the Motor Control Laboratory at Indiana University. Subjects: The experimental group was composed of 20 individuals who had undergone ACL reconstruction with a patellar tendon autograft. The control group comprised 20 participants with no history of significant orthopaedic injuries to the lower extremities. Measurements: The dependent variables were sway path linear mean for the static condition, dynamic-phase recovery time after perturbation for the dynamic measure, and quadriceps peak torque for strength. Results: We found significant differences between the ACL and control groups on the measures of dynamic-phase duration and peak torque. The static sway variable did not show a significant difference. Conclusions: Evaluation of the postural control system under 2 conditions, static and dynamic, showed differences between the ACL and control groups for the dynamic condition only. These results suggest the presence of independent control mechanisms for the control of static and more dynamic postures. In addition, because there were no differences between the injured and noninjured legs of the ACL group, the theory of a central postural control scheme is supported.","Balance; Posture","","","","","","","","Emerson, R.

Lab., University of Pittsburgh Musculoskeletal Research Center, Pittsburgh, PA, United States","Objective: Underlying the ability of the hamstrings to decrease tibial anterior shear is the time of firing in comparison with the quadriceps. This timing may be aided by neural programming during a planned or expected activity. It is theorized that individuals who have better programming ability will suffer fewer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries due to joint protection through muscular stabilization. A component of this dynamic restraint is the development of muscular tension before the knee is loaded. The objective of our study was to compare the muscular activity before footstrike in ACL-deficient (ACL-D), ACL-reconstructed (ACL-R), and control (C) females during functional activities. Design and Setting: Active females were divided into groups based on their ACL status. The study was conducted in a neuromuscular research laboratory. Subjects: Twenty-four female subjects (ACL-D = 6, ACL-R = 12, C = 6). Measurements: Integrated electromyographic (IEMG) activity from the thigh (vastus medialis obliquus [VMO], vastus lateralis [VL], medial hamstring, and lateral hamstring) and leg (medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius [LG]) and footswitch signals were recorded during downhill walking (15° at 0.92 m/s), running (2.08 m/s), hopping, and landing from a step (20.3 cm). IEMG activity was normalized to the mean amplitude of the sample and analyzed for area and mean amplitude for 150 milliseconds before heelstrike. Side-to-side differences were determined by t tests, and separate one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to detect differences among the 3 groups for each muscle of each activity. Results: IEMG area side-to-side differences for the ACL-D group appeared in the LG (involved [I] = 36.4 ± 19.7, uninvolved [U] = 60.1 ± 23.6) during landing, in the VMO (I = 11.4 ± 3.8, U = 7.2 ± 3.1) and VL (I = 13.3 ± 2.7, U = 8.9 ± 1.9) during running, and in the VMO (I = 9.2 ± 4.2, U = 19.5 ± 7.3) during downhill walking. IEMG mean amplitude side-to-side differences for the ACL-D group appeared in the LG (I = 79.7 ± 30.3, U = 122.3 ± 34.9) during downhill walking and in the VMO (I = 78.6 ± 23.2, U = 45.8 ± 18.9) during the run; IEMG mean amplitude side-to-side differences for the ACL-R group appeared in the LG (I = 74.7 ± 40.0, U = 52.8 ± 14.3) during the hop. The ACL-D group had higher IEMG means than control in the VL (ACL-D = 12.9 ± 5.8, C = 7.1 ± 3.9), but lower in the VMO (ACL-D = 9.2 ± 4.2, C = 15.7 ± 3.6). Conclusions: The side-to-side differences of the ACL-D and ACL-R groups, as well as the group differences between ACL-D and control, suggest that different muscle activation strategies are used by females when performing different dynamic activities. Therefore, muscle unit differentiation may be the cause of our results. These changes appear to be reversed through surgery or the associated postoperative rehabilitation.","Activation; Closed kinetic chain; Muscle; Preparation","","","","","","","","Arendt, Elizabeth Anne, Knee Injury Patterns Among Men and Women in Collegiate Basketball and Soccer: NCAA Data and Review of Literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 694-701, (1995); J South Orthop Assoc, (2025); Noyes, Frank R., The symptomatic anterior cruciate-deficient knee.

The extent of a voluntary-activation deficit in patients after isolated rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), however, has been reported to be small or nonexistent, making it questionable if a voluntary-activation deficit is a relevant factor for these patients at all. Methods: In this study the ability to voluntarily activate the quadriceps femoris muscles was quantified in 22 male patients with arthroscopically-proven isolated ACL ruptures using an established highly sensitive twitch-interpolation technique. Furthermore, the maximal voluntary contraction force of the quadriceps muscle was obtained by isometric knee-joint torque measurements. The results were compared with an age-, gender-, and activity-matched control group. Results: There was a moderate but significant mean reduction in maximal voluntary activation (VA) in both the injured (VA: 83.9 ± 2.3%, mean ± SEM) and uninjured side (VA: 84.7 ± 2.2%) in comparison with controls (VA: 91.1 ± 0.8%). However, of the patients the 23% who presented a considerably reduced voluntary-activation of less than 80% were mainly responsible for the significant mean deficit. Conclusions: The deficit of isometric muscle strength on the injured side compared with that of controls was explained by the voluntary-activation deficit and a true muscle weakness. On the other hand, the diminished muscle strength of the uninjured side was explained sufficiently by the voluntary-activation deficit alone. Considering the bilateral voluntary-activation deficit, functional muscle tests might not be valid when the uninjured extremity serves as reference.","Arthrogenous muscle inhibition; Twitch interpolation; Voluntary isometric contraction","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; controlled study; dysmetria; human; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle twitch; muscle weakness; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","","","","","Allen, Gabrielle M., Reliability of measurements of muscle strength and voluntary activation using twitch interpolation, Muscle & Nerve, 18, 6, pp. 593-600, (1995); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Functional analysis of pre and post-knee surgery: Total knee arthroplasty and ACL reconstruction, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 115, 4, pp. 575-581, (1993); Arvidsson, Inga, Prevention of quadriceps wasting after immobilization: An evaluation of the effect of electrical stimulation, Orthopedics, 9, 11, pp. 1519-1528, (1986); Arvidsson, Inga, Isokinetic thigh muscle strength after ligament reconstruction in the knee joint: Results from a 5-10 year follow-up after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee joint, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 1, pp. 7-11, (1981); Awiszus, Friedemann, Influence of stimulus cross talk on results of the twitch-interpolation technique at the biceps brachii muscle, Muscle and Nerve, 20, 9, pp. 1187-1190, (1997); Baugher, W.

Methods: Forty-five patients with unilateral ACL rupture (confirmed via arthroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arthrometer measurements) participated in this study. Subjects were divided into two groups: copers (N = 12), and subacute noncopers (N = 18) and chronic noncopers (N = 15). All copers had returned to all preinjury activity (including index sport) without limitation. Maximum manual anterior tibiofemoral laxity measurements, quadriceps femoris muscle strength measurements, and a series of hop tests were performed. Lysholm Scale, Knee Outcome Survey (KOS), global rating of knee function, and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form were completed. Results: There was no significant difference in laxity between copers (X̄ = 5.5 ± 2.7 mm) and noncopers (chronic, X̄ = 5.1 ± 2.8 mm and subacute, X̄ = 4.2 ± 2.2 mm) or in IKDC scores among the groups. The copers, however, scored significantly better than the chronic and subacute ACL-deficient subsets on all other measures. Measurements of laxity were not correlated to any functional outcome measure or to episodes of instability. Conclusions: Copers were not different in any meaningful way from the noncopers before injury, had equal or greater side-to-side laxity differences, and functioned normally. A battery of tests was identified that accurately discriminated noncopers from copers even early after injury. Thus, measurements of laxity alone are insufficient for determining functional status after ACL injury.","Functional outcome measures; Instrumented laxity measurements; Quadriceps femoris muscle; Strength","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; coping behavior; functional assessment; human; joint instability; knee function; knee injury; knee ligament injury; medical instrumentation; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","KT-2000 arthrometer, Medmetric","Medmetric","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R15HD031695); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","","Am J Knee Surg, (1993); Anderson, A.

The patients had KT-1000 arthrometer testing before beginning the program and at subsequent follow-up after they had performed the sport activity. The mean manual maximum KT-1000 arthrometer difference was 1.9 ± 1.3 mm at initial testing and 1.9 ± 1.2 mm at follow-up testing. The frequency distribution of the KT-1000 arthrometer scores revealed that 92.7% of patients at initial testing and 93.2% of patients at follow-up testing had displacement difference of 3 mm or less. The results of this study show that functional sports agility programs during the early rehabilitation period after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a correctly placed autogenous patellar tendon graft do not cause a change in graft stability.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; controlled study; device; evaluation; female; follow up; human; knee instability; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; priority journal; rehabilitation; sport; tendon graft","","","KT-1000","","","","Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Arms, Steven W., The biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation and reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 8-18, (1984); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anterior cruciate ligament replacement using patellar tendon.

Objectives: To analyze changes in impairments and disabilities among patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and to assess the relationships between the impairment and disability outcome measures from 3 months to 2 years following ACL reconstruction. Background: Outcomes after ACL reconstruction can be categorized as impairments or disabilities. The relationship between impairments and disabilities may be crucial to understanding physical therapy interventions and predicting long-term outcome. Methods and Measures: Sixty patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction participated in the study. Impairment measures were range of motion, pain, knee-joint laxity, and muscle performance using isokinetic muscle tests. Disability measures were the Cincinnati knee score and lower limb performance using the triple-jump and stair-hop tests. Follow-up times were 3 and 6 months and 1 and 2 years after surgery. Results: The Cincinnati knee score results show significant improvement 1 year after surgery (84.2 ± 13.6) compared with 6 months (76.8 ± 13.7) and 3 months (67.4 ± 16.3) after surgery. Quadriceps total work (percentage of normal leg) significantly improved 2 years after surgery (92.6 ± 14.1%) compared with 1 year after surgery (81.6 ± 16.8%). Between 37 and 75% of the variability in the Cincinnati knee score could be explained by variation in the impairment variables, and quadriceps muscle performance and pain were the most significant predictors of disability. Extension deficit and pain at 3 months were significantly related to the Cincinnati knee score at the 2-year follow- up. Conclusions: Up to 2 years may be needed to regain normal quadriceps muscle performance following ACL reconstruction. Pain and quadriceps muscle performance explained most of the variability in the Cincinnati knee score.","Knee function; Outcome measurements; Rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical trial; female; goniometry; human; isokinetic exercise; joint function; joint laxity; knee; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle function; outcomes research; pain assessment; physical disability; physiotherapy; quadriceps femoris muscle; scoring system","","","","","","","The recommended quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness in healthy adults, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 22, 2, pp. 265-274, (1990); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Single-incision endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

The purpose of this case report is to describe the evaluation, treatment, and short-term outcome for an individual with chronic, progressively worsening instability of the knee during gait associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency. Case Description. The patient was a 34-year-old man who sustained bilateral ACL injuries. Subsequently, an autograft reconstruction of the left knee ACL was performed. Eight months post-reconstruction, the left knee was trustable despite bracing. Gait analysis and tests to determine the presence of muscle inhibition were performed prior to and after 12 weeks of training. Isometric torque of the knee extensors and flexors was measured with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. A training program primarily consisted of electromyographic biofeedback during thigh muscle exercises, balance exercises, and gait. Outcomes. Muscle inhibition decreased and maximal isometric knee flexion and extension torques increased during the 12-week training period. Gait analysis demonstrated a 50% decrease in the maximum knee extensor moment and an increase in walking speed. Discussion. Selected gait variables, torque production, and muscle inhibition may change in a person with an unstable knee. The measurement of variables that have previously been documented as mechanisms of knee instability during walking allows for the selection of a specific treatment approach.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Electromyography; Gait analysis; Rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; case report; chronic disease; electromyography; feedback system; gait; hamstring; human; joint stability; knee injury; male; motor performance; muscle contraction; quadriceps femoris muscle; training; treatment planning; walking","","","","","","","Andriacchi, Thomas P., Dynamics of pathological motion: Applied to the anterior cruciate deficient knee, Journal of Biomechanics, 23, SUPPL. 1, pp. 99-105, (1990); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior knee laxity in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament disruption, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 6, pp. 401-407, (1985); Yack, H.

Bone patellar tendon-bone and the hamstring tendon generally have been used. In the present study, we describe an alternative graft, the quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft, by using arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Methods: From March of 1996 through March of 1997, a quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft was used in 12 patients with ACL injuries. Results: After 15 to 24 months of follow-up, the clinical outcome for those patients with this graft have been encouraging. Ten patients could return to the same or a higher level of preinjury sports activity. According to the International Knee Documentation Committee rating system, 10 of the 12 patients had normal or nearly normal ratings. Recovery of quadriceps muscle strength to 80% of the normal knee was achieved in 11 patients in 1 year. Conclusion: The advantages of the quadriceps tendon graft include the following: the graft is larger and stronger than the patellar tendon; morbidity of harvest technique and donor site is less than that of patellar tendon graft; there is little quadriceps inhibition after quadriceps harvest; there is quicker return to sports activities with aggressive rehabilitation. A quadriceps tendon-patellar autograft is a reasonable alternative to ACL reconstruction in patients who are not suitable for either a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Quadriceps tendon autograft","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; clinical article; female; hamstring; human; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; knee ligament injury; ligament surgery; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; physical activity; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; sport; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993); Olson, Eric J., Clinical use of fresh, frozen soft tissue allografts, Orthopedics, 15, 10, pp. 1225-1232, (1992); Blauth, Walter, 2-strip substitution-plasty of the anterior cruciate ligament with the quadriceps tendon, Unfallheilkunde, 87, 2, pp. 45-51, (1984); Stäubli, Hans Ulrich, Quadriceps tendon and patellar ligament: Cryosectional anatomy and structural properties in young adults, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 4, 2, pp. 100-110, (1996); Harris, Norman Lindsay, Central quadriceps tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Although the patellar tendon has traditionally been the gold standard graft choice for reconstruction, the hamstring tendon has now also become a popular graft choice because its use reduces postoperative anterior knee pain and donor site morbidity. From March 1996 to December 1996, we used hamstring tendon grafts for the surgical reconstruction of the ACL in 26 patients. All patients were followed and evaluated for an average of 28 months. Return to the same or higher level of pre-injury sports activity was achieved in 22 of the 26 patients (85%). Overall outcome as measured by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) rating was normal or nearly normal in 23 of the 26 patients (88%). The overall 100-point Subjective Knee Score was 87.4. Cybex dynamometer testing showed that quadriceps strength of the operated knee recovered to more than 80% of the normal knee in 24 of 26 patients (92%). One patient had hamstring muscle power limitation. For the assessment of tunnel expansion after ACL reconstruction, the diameter of the bone tunnel was measured and compared with the original reamed diameter. Enlargement of at least 2 mm was found in 5 femoral tunnels (19%) and in 3 tibial tunnels (12%). In this report, we describe the surgical technique of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with autograft of quadruple hamstring tendons, including double loops of semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. A new fixation method was used in which Mersilene tape and a washer were applied at the femoral side and sutures of tendons to a screw at the tibial side. This technique is easy to learn and does not require any specific fixation device. The clinical results at a minimum 2-year follow-up with this technique were satisfactory in 88% of patients.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Hamstring tendons autograft","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; dynamometry; female; follow up; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; knee arthroscopy; ligament surgery; male; mobilization; patella tendon; quadriceps femoris muscle; semitendinous muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment indication; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10225536","","JOTSE","","English","J.

Material and methods 138 patients of a mean age of 27,8 ± 8,5 years had been operated. Delay between injury and operation was 4 ± 4,8 years. The surgical 'Mac Injones' procedure used a free autologous patellar tendon graft with a bone-to-bone fixation, supplemented by a lateral extra- articular plasty using a strip of quadriceps tendon as a direct prolongation of the graft of the patellar tendon and patella itself. A rehabilitation program aimed to an early recovery of a complete range of motion. Anterior laxity had been measured before and after operation using two instrumented methods, KT-1000 and stressradiography (at 20°of flexion with a 9 kg load applied at the distal part of the thigh) with measurements of the displacement in medial and lateral compartments. Tunnel positioning was appreciated radiologically. Function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score (I.K.D.C.). Results Elongation of the reconstructed ligament occurred mainly during the first 6 month, but was independent from early full range of motion recovery. Laxity was stabilized after one year. The final laxity gain of the medial compartment was 62 per cent and for the lateral compartment 77 per cent. The pivot shift test was negative in 66 per cent, grade 2 in 4 per cent, grade 1 in 30 per cent. Functional results were excellent and good (A and B) in 60,4 per cent and 76,7 per cent returned to sports activity. 12 reconstructed ligaments reruptured. Arthritis was the cause of poor results in other cases (13,8 per cent). Discussion Lateral extra-articular plasty is unable to better control translation of the medial compartment than isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but laxity of the lateral compartment was minimized and the pivot shift test also. Incorrect position of the anterior cruciate ligament was correlated with poor results. Conclusion This documented study on laxity of the two compartments confirms the interest of each type of reconstruction, in particular extra-articular plasty when made with quadriceps tendon and so doing, preserving the iliotibial-band for the control of varus stability.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; follow up; human; knee arthritis; knee arthroplasty; knee instability; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; postoperative complication; prospective study; surgical technique; adolescent; arthritis; autotransplantation; chronic disease; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; knee injury; mechanical stress; middle aged; patella ligament; pathophysiology; physiology; physiotherapy; recurrent disease; rupture; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthritis; Chronic Disease; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Physical Therapy Modalities; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Recurrence; Rupture; Stress, Mechanical; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); These Med, (1995); Acta Radiol Diagn Stockh, (1968); Almekinders, Louis C., Post-operative problems following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 2, pp. 78-82, (1995); Anderson, Allen F., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons Augmented by the Losee Iliotibial Band Tenodesis: A Long-term Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 620-626, (1994); Cahiers D Enseignement De La Sofcot, (1987); Barber-Westin, Sue D., The effect of rehabilitation and return to activity on anterior-posterior knee displacements after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 264-270, (1993); J Bone Joint Surg Br, (1984); Beaufils, Phillippe, Meniscal injury in the plastic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

There is the difficulty to distinguish the morbidity associated with the graft harvest and the morbidity caused by the injury and the reconstruction procedure. In order to clarify the morbidity resulting from the graft harvest alone, we evaluated those patients who had transplantat harvest from the opposite knee. Between 1990 and 1995 a central bone-tendon- bone graft has been taken from the contralateral uninjured knee in 37 patients, in 22 cases for anterior and in 15 cases for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. 27 patients were clinically (IKDC Score), isokinetically and radiologically followed up in an average of 25,3 months after the operation (range: 9-73 months). 21 patients were classified into IKDC group A. Except of one patient with an extension deficit of 5°all others showed normal range of motion. Only 5 of 27 patients expressed minimal knee pain during vigorous activities. Three of them reported about weather sensitivity in addition. These 6 patients were ranked in group B. No patient was classified into IKDC group C or D. The isokinetic examination showed a normal level of quadriceps strength. At final followup, the technique of Blackburne and Peel was used to assess patellar height. There was no radiographic evidence of patella contracture or baja. According to our results taking the autogenous CBTB graft used for cruciate ligament reconstruction leads to no serious morbidity.","CBTB graft; Cruciate ligament; Morbidity; Reconstruction","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical article; human; joint mobility; knee function; knee injury; knee radiography; knee surgery; ligament injury; morbidity; muscle strength; patella; treatment outcome; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; female; follow up; injury; knee ligament; male; middle aged; muscle isometric contraction; physiology; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; radiography; tendon transfer; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Pain, Postoperative; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Postoperative Complications; Tendon Transfer","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Blackburn, J.

In Part I, peak anterior tibial translation (ATT) was assessed for 1 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficient and 16 control subjects during two sets of three active trials (maximal isometric quadriceps contractions) and three passive trials (240 N load) conducted over four consecutive days. In Part II, peak ATT was recorded for 12 chronic ACL deficient subjects during one set of five active and five passive trials within one day. Results were analysed using mixed repeated measures ANOVA designs with intraclass reliability coefficients (ICC) calculated from the ANOVA results. There were no significant differences in the mean peak ATT results among the four tests days or between the two test sets conducted within a day, with ICC ranging from R<inf>1</inf> = 0.939 to 0.980. It was concluded peak ATT measurements obtained using the DCT were reproducible from day-to-day and set-to-set. A significant main effect of trial was found on both active (F((2,32)) = 13.93; p < 0.001) and passive (F((2,32)) = 57.21; p < 0.001) peak ATT results. It was therefore recommended a full pretrial should be conducted before knee laxity assessment using the DCT to ensure reproducible results.","","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic value; female; functional assessment; human; isometric exercise; joint laxity; knee cruciate ligament; knee injury; male; reproducibility","","","","","","","Anderson, Allen F., Instrumented evaluation of knee laxity: A comparison of five arthrometers, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 135-140, (1992); Andersson, Christer A., Instrumented testing for evaluation of sagittal knee laxity, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 256, pp. 178-184, (1990); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthrometric evaluation of knees that have a torn anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 9, pp. 1299-1306, (1990); Bagger, J., Effect of functional bracing, quadriceps and hamstrings on anterior tibial translation in anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency: A preliminary study, Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development, 29, 1, pp. 9-12, (1992); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior knee laxity in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament disruption, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 6, pp. 401-407, (1985); Edixhoven, Philip J., Anteroposterior drawer measurements in the knee using an instrumented test device, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 247, pp. 232-242, (1989); Edixhoven, Philip J., Accuracy and reproducibility of instrumented knee‐drawer tests, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 5, 3, pp. 378-387, (1987); Fleming, Braden C., Clinical versus instrumented knee testing on autopsy specimens, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 282, pp. 196-207, (1992)","","","Sports Medicine Australia","","","","","","14402440","","JSMSF","9923733","English","J.

There was no effect of weightbearing on knee extension range of motion or vastus medialis oblique function at followup. In addition, knee stability was not compromised after surgery. Seven of 20 (35%) nonweightbearing patients and only two of 25 (8%) immediate weightbearing patients reported anterior knee pain at followup. Overall, immediate weightbearing did not compromise knee joint stability and resulted in a better outcome with a decreased incidence of anterior knee pain.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone pain; clinical article; electromyography; female; follow up; human; joint stability; knee function; ligament surgery; male; patella ligament; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; surgical technique; treatment outcome; vastus medialis muscle; weight bearing","","","","","","","Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Baratta, Richard V., Muscular coactivation.

Forty-two patients (84%) returned for follow-up a mean of 31 months postoperatively. Twenty-one patients had acute ruptures, and 21, chronic ruptures. A progressive rehabilitation program was used by 28 patients (67%) who met strict criteria, which allowed early return to running and sports activities. The results were rated with the Cincinnati Knee Rating System. We found no effect of either injury chronicity or time to return to activity for 21 factors, including anterior-posterior displacement, patellofemoral crepitus, range of knee motion, quadriceps muscle strength, symptoms, functional limitations, or the patient rating of outcome. Using arthrometer and pivot-shift test data, 30 knees (71%) had a functional reconstruction; 8 knees (19%) had partial function; and 4 knees (10%) failed.

However, the question of whether the uninvolved leg may serve as a reference on functional tests has not been adequately answered. In particular, the one-legged rebound vertical jump has not been used to assess functional levels following surgery of the cruciate ligament. The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine whether the uninvolved leg is within normal range of an age- and weight-matched group, 2) to determine differences between the involved and uninvolved leg in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 3) to examine the relationship between knee extensor strength and four functional performance tests, and 4) to determine if the one-legged rebound vertical jump yields more information in the assessment of knee function than the other functional tests with respect to two time- frames. Fifty healthy subjects (group A, mean age = 28.1 years) and 55 anterior cruciate ligament patients (groups B and C) participated in dynamometric measurement, one-legged and two-legged vertical jump, and the single- and the triple-hop test. Mean time for testing was 13 weeks following surgery for group B (N = 30, mean age = 27.8 years) and 54 weeks following surgery for group C (N = 25, mean age = 29.9 years). Pearson product moment correlation coefficients between peak torque and single and triple hop were r = .45, r = .48, r = .51, and r = .55 for groups B and C, respectively. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients between peak torque and the height of the vertical jump was r = .51 for group C. Results for group A revealed limb symmetry indices of 95% or more on all functional performance and isokinetic tests. In group B, all patients showed a limb symmetry index of less than 85% on all tests. In group C, the index for the vertical jump was the only functional test that fell below the level of 85%. Regardless of whether the dominant or nondominant leg is involved, the uninvolved leg can be used adequately as a reference guide for outcome from rehabilitation using these measurements. The one-legged vertical jump test is capable of detecting functional limitations of the lower limb following knee ligament reconstruction up to 54 weeks postoperatively.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Functional tests; Muscle strength; One-legged vertical jump","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bicycle ergometry; brace; controlled study; dynamometry; ergometer; function test; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; weight bearing","","","Cybex 6000, brady; Dynavit Meditronic 40, Siemens; Jumpergometer, fitronic","brady; Siemens; fitronic","","","Anderson, Mark A., Data preparation.

The hop test was conducted on 107 patients with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament- reconstructed knees (78 semitendinosus tendon autografts and 29 bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts). Patients were tested an average of 2 years after surgery. Correlation coefficient analyses determined whether the relationship between knee muscle strength recovery and the hop test was invariant across all levels of residual anterior laxity and whether the relationship between residual anterior laxity and the hop test was invariant across levels of quadriceps muscle strength recovery. Furthermore, we examined the effect of graft harvest site on the hop index. Positive correlations were found between the hop index and muscle strength index at all levels of residual anterior laxity (P < 0.05), but these correlation coefficients were relatively low. There were no apparent correlations between the hop index and residual anterior laxity at all levels of quadriceps muscle strength recovery. There was no significant difference in the average hop index between the semitendinosus tendon autograft group and the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft group.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; compliance (physical); correlation function; data analysis; female; human; isokinetic exercise; knee arthroplasty; leg exercise; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; postoperative care; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; tendon graft; torque","","","Cybex II, Cybex; KT 1000, Medmetric","Cybex; Medmetric","","","Knee Surgery, (1994); Contemp Orthop, (1982); Am J Knee Surg, (1988); Phys Ther, (1993); Trans Jpn Soc Clin Biomech, (1996); Noyes, Frank R., Abnormal lower limb symmetry determined by function hop tests after anterior cruciate ligament rupture, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 5, pp. 513-518, (1991); Sachs, Raymond A., Patellofemoral problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 6, pp. 760-765, (1989); Solomonow, Moshe, The synergistic action of the anterior cruciate ligament and thigh muscles in maintaining joint stability, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 207-213, (1987); Wilk, Kevin E., The relationship between subjective knee scores, isokinetic testing, and functional testing in the ACL-reconstructed knee, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 20, 2, pp. 60-73, (1994); J Tokyo Knee Society, (1996)","","","SAGE Publications Inc. claims@sagepub.com","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","9617400","English","Am.

Six recreational skiers, 4 women and 2 men (average age 26.6 years), were measured before and after two periods of free skiing for 2 h each for control. According to statistical analysis, anterior knee laxity significantly increased after racing activity. The post-race measurement of anterior laxities showed that 2 of the skiers had a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The histological findings regarding the ruptured ACL revealed waving of the collagen fiber and remodeled ACL collagen fiber. We suspect that the excessive stress on the knee caused by quadriceps contraction may weaken the ligamentous tensile property.","Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Anterior knee laxity; Ski injury","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; human; injury; joint instability; knee injury; male; mechanical stress; pathology; rupture; skiing; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Rupture; Skiing; Stress, Mechanical","","","","","","","Skiing Trauma and Safety Seventh International Symposium ASTM STP 1022, (1989); Beynnon, Bruce D., The measurement of anterior cruciate ligament strain in vivo, International Orthopaedics, 16, 1, pp. 1-12, (1992); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985); Skiing, (1985); Am J Sports Med, (1986); Steiner, Mark E., The effect of exercise on anterior-posterior knee laxity, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 1, pp. 24-29, (1986); Stoller, David W., The effects of exercise, ice, and ultrasonography on torsional laxity of the knee, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 174, pp. 172-180, (1983); Weisman, Gerald, Cyclic loading in knee ligament injuries, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 8, 1, pp. 24-30, (1980)","","","Springer Verlag","","","","","","09422056","","","9704324","English","Knee Surg.

Material and methods: The authors analized two consecutive series of 60 and 50 patients operated by the same surgeon for a chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, one by reconstruction of the cruciate ligament with a free graft of the patellar tendon supplemented by an external extra-articular plasty made with a quadriceps tendon graft and the second with an isolated free patellar tendon graft. Anterior laxity was measured before and after surgery, by dynamic X- rays and by the Medmetric KT-1000 arthrometer. Functional results were evaluated four years after operation, with the French A.R.P.E.GE score based on sport activity level and intensity. Results: Anterior laxity was not different before operation in both groups and there was no difference between males and females. Medmetric KT-1000 arthrometer showed the same negative differential laxity immediately after surgery in both groups and the same evolution during the first 4 years, without any significant difference on laxity on the middle aspect of the knee. Radiological results were different. After a 4 years follow-up, anterior laxity did not show significant difference on the medial compartment of the knee (5.3 ± 2.3 mm and 5.5 ± 1.7 mm), but there was a significant minor laxity in the lateral compartment for the lateral extra-articular plasty group (11.0 ± 2.3 mm against 14.8 ± 3.8 mm) (p = 0.002). Functional results and sport activity were similar in both groups. Examination showed 4 positive pivot shift tests (2' sliding' and 2 positive) in the group with extra-articular plasty, even though 8 positive pivot shift tests in the isolated ACL group (5 'sliding' and 3 positive) were found. Discussion: This study as well as five others studies found in literature, was not randomized. In all these series, the surgical techniques, the rehabilitation programs and the functional score evaluation were too different to allow any pertinent comparison. Extra-articular plasty helps to control the laxity of the lateral compartment of the knee which is incompletely controlled by ACL reconstruction, particularly in chronic cases. This is proved by radiological measurements and pivot shift tests. Jensen in 1983, about 205 patients with a 4 year follow-up and Noyes, which used an allograft patellar tendon, found an advantage to do extra-articular plasty. But Strum (in 1989), as O'Brien (in 1991) and Roth (in 1987), did not found any advantage with extra-articular plasty. Conclusion: It is therefore obvious after a four-year follow-up, that extra-articular supplementation presents an advantage for reconstruction of the ACL, by a free graft of the patellar tendon in chronic cases. Further randomized study w confirm that isolated ACL reconstruction is possible in some well definited categories of anterior laxity.","","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; follow up; human; joint laxity; ligament surgery; major clinical study; patella tendon; quadriceps femoris muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Child; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Butler, David L., Mechanical properties of primate vascularized vs. nonvascularized patellar tendon grafts; changes over time, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 7, 1, pp. 68-79, (1989); Carson, William G., The role of lateral extra-articular procedures for anterolateral rotatory instability., Clinics in sports medicine, 7, 4, pp. 751-772, (1988); Clancy, William G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using one-third of the patellar ligament, augmented by extra-articular tendon transfers, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 64, 3, pp. 352-359, (1982); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985); Engebretsen, Lars, The effect of an iliotibial tenodesis on intraarticular graft forces and knee joint motion, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 2, pp. 169-176, (1990); Hoogland, T., Intra-articular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

A total of 38 patients operated using the patellar tendon (PT group: 17 cases) and the doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (DSTG group: 21 cases) groft alternately, followed by the same rehabilitation program, were selected according to the following criteria: 1) not more than 5 mm anterior tibial translation of the operated versus the contralateral knee in the KT-1000 test at 30 Ibs 2) freedom from symptoms and resumption of sport at a high level; 3) unimpaired contralateral limb and intact ACL. The controls were 40 subjects matched with the patients for age, sex, height, weight, dominant limb and level of sports activity. Isokinetic evaluation of all subjects was performed with a Cybex II at 60°, 120° and 180°/sec. In the PT group, the mean quadriceps deficiency versus the contralateral limb was 3% and 5% versus the controls. In the DSTG group, the mean hamstring deficiency was 6% versus the contralateral limb and 9% versus the controls. The quadriceps also displayed a deficiency versus the contralateral in both groups. The hamstrings in the PT group were equal to the contralateral, whereas in the DSTG group there was a slight negative difference. The flexor/extensor ratio, too, was more markedly different vis-à-vis the controls in the PT group. Lastly, the peak torque angle was significantly greater for the quadriceps and the hamstrings in both patient groups compared with the controls.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Isokinetic evaluation; Muscle strength","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; female; functional assessment; hamstring; human; ligament surgery; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Alm, Anders, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by using the medial third of the patellar ligament.

During the year 1990, all the patients were operated arthroscopically using semitendinosus and gracilis tendons as autogenous graft. The same rehabilitation program was used. Extensor and flexor muscle strength was evaluated with a Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer. The peak quadriceps and hamstrings torque, the body weight (BW)/peak torque ratio and the hamstrings/quadriceps ratio were measured at 60°, 120°e 180°/sec (5 repetitions) Cybex II testing revealed statistically significant differences between group B and the other two groups in terms of peak extension (p=0.01) and flexion (p=0.01) torques, BW/quadriceps torque ratio (p=0.01) and BW/hamstrings torque (p=0.01) ratio and in hamstrings/quadriceps ratio (p=0.01 at 60°/sec and p=0.05 at 120°/sec). The index of quadriceps strength symmetry between lower limbs was -2.8%, -3% and +5.3% for group A, B and C respectively (n.s.) and the hamstrings index was -2.7%, -2.8% and -2.6% respectively (n.s.). In conclusion, in these selected groups of athletes, the ACL reconstruction performed in an early phase from the injury allowed a better recovery of balancing and muscle strength of the injured lower limb.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Isokinetic evaluation; Muscle strength","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; athlete; autograft; clinical article; controlled study; female; hamstring; human; ligament surgery; male; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","","","","","Alm, Anders, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by using the medial third of the patellar ligament.

The patients were followed prospectively and objective physical examination data were obtained on 806 patients at a mean of 4.0 years postoperatively. Subjective follow-up data were obtained on 948 patients at a mean of 4.4 years postoperatively. The mean final range of motion was 5°/0°/140°. The mean manual maximum KT-1000 arthrometer score was 2.0 ± 1.5 mm. Isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength testing revealed a mean of 94% strength after acute reconstructions and 91% strength after chronic reconstructions. International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation after acute reconstruction rated 42% of knees as normal, 47% as near normal, 10% as abnormal, and 1% as severely abnormal. The same evaluation after chronic reconstruction rated 41% of knees as normal, 44% as near normal, 14% as abnormal, and 1% as severely abnormal. Radiographically, 94% of acute knees and 89% of chronic knees had no joint space narrowing. Subjective modified Noyes questionnaire results showed a mean score of 93.2 ± 7.9 points. The mean time for patients to return to sport-specific activities was 6.2 weeks and to athletic competition at full capacity was 6.2 months postoperatively. In the long term, patients exhibited full range of motion, excellent stability, good strength, and a return of full function in most cases.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; knee arthroplasty; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Knee Ligaments Structure Function Injury and Repair, (1990); Amiel, David A., The natural history of the anterior cruciate ligament autograft of patellar tendon origin, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 6, pp. 449-462, (1986); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anterior cruciate ligament replacement using patellar tendon.

Specifically, the effect on knee function, knee extension and flexion strength, the size of the individual posterior thigh muscles, and the extent of retraction of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were evaluated. At final follow-up, each patient was evaluated using the following functional scales: International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), Lysholm, and Tegner. Each patient also had a dynamometer evaluation and a comprehensive magnetic resonance imaging study of both the operated and nonoperated knees. The average functional evaluation scores were: HSS-47.9, Lysholm-88, and Tegner-0.27. The average percent quadriceps and hamstring strength of the operated compared with the nonoperated extremities were 93.7% and 95.3%, respectively; neither decrease was significant. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the cross-sectional areas of the biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and sartorius muscles of both thighs at the same level above the joint were not significantly different. The distal-most insertion of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons after harvest were always more proximal than the nonoperated side; the average difference was 26.7 mm (range: 11 to 32 mm) for the semitendinosus (unable to calculate in three patients) and 47.1 mm (range: 17 to 72 mm) for the gracilis. We conclude that tendon harvest of the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles does not significantly compromise function and strength despite a more proximal insertion of the retracted tendons. In addition, the majority of cases demonstrated some but never complete regrowth or scar formation of these tendon remnants.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; follow up; human; injury; knee injury; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; skeletal muscle; tendon; tendon transfer; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Tendon Transfer; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","08997403","","","9131234","English","Am J Knee Surg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031087899"

Of 50 patients 30% displayed symptoms or signs 2 months after the injury and 36% on subsequent examination an average of 5.6 years later. In a repeat clinical examination one anterior cruciate ligament rupture was not confirmed at the primary stage (2%). For assessment of stability and extent of injury, the repeat clinical examination proved reliable. Ruptures of the meniscus were noted in 18% of the patients in connection with the primary injury. Of those who underwent a meniscus operation, 27% had further operations and, four patients of 50 had another operation as a result of a new trauma. Thus, a total of 25% of the patients required surgery. The material is biased as I sought to exclude ligament ruptures in the first instance. No patient was permanently incapacitated from work. A large portion of the later symptoms were connected with the patellofemoral joint or with the postoperative condition. Bandaging did not affect the resulting recovery rate. Regular exercise of the thigh muscles prevented the onset of quadriceps atrophy, but there was a clear deterioration in the condition of the muscles in the early stages.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; clinical examination; conservative treatment; deterioration; exercise; female; follow up; human; knee injury; knee meniscus rupture; male; muscle atrophy; patellofemoral joint; priority journal; symptom; time","","","","","","","Balkfors, Bengt, The course of knee-ligament injuries., Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica, Supplement, 198, pp. 1-99, (1982); Ballmer, Peter Matthias, The non operative treatment of isolated complete tears of the medial collateral ligament of the knee - A Prospective Study, Archives of Orthopaedic and Traumatic Surgery, 107, 5, pp. 273-276, (1988); Clancy, William G., Knee ligamentous injury in sports: The past, present, and future, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 15, 1, pp. 9-14, (1983); DeHaven, Kenneth E., Diagnosis of acute knee injuries with hemarthrosis, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 8, 1, pp. 9-14, (1980); Fetto, Joseph F., Medial collateral ligament injuries of the knee: A rationale for treatment, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, NO.132, pp. 206-218, (1978); Gillquist, Jan, Arthroscopy in acute injuries of the knee joint, Acta Orthopaedica, 48, 2, pp. 190-196, (1977); Gurtler, Robert A., Lachman test evaluated.

We recorded electric activity in the articular nerves (posterior PAN and medial MAN) and periarticular muscles (quadriceps and hamstring), while performing passive flexion, extension, internal and external rotation. We then produced anterior displacement of the tibia at 30°and 90°of flexion, as in the Lachman and the anterior drawer maneuvers. The anterior cruciate ligament was surgically sectioned and the same series of passive displacements was performed. We observed statistically significant increased activity in the MAN, the PAN and the quadriceps muscle during knee flexion, in the MAN during extension, and in the PAN and hamstring during external rotation with the knee 90°flexed. Anterior cruciate transection caused anterior displacement of the tibia during stress. This produced a significant increase in the MAN activity and a significant decrease in the hamstring electric activity at 30°and 90°of flexion, as in Lachman and anterior drawer maneuvers. We conclude that electric activity in the articular nerves and periarticular muscles, in response to passive motion and anterior tibial displacement, is altered in the cat's knee after anterior cruciate transection. This suggests that various patterns of periarticular muscle reaction in the anterior cruciate-deficient knee may be related to the unconscious perception of abnormal motion.","","animal experiment; anterior cruciate ligament; article; cat; controlled study; electromyography; hamstring; knee; knee function; ligament injury; motor nerve conduction; movement perception; muscle contraction; nonhuman; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","","","","","Andriacchi, Thomas P., Functional testing in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 40-47, (1993); Barrack, Robert L., Proprioception in the anterior cruciate deficient knee, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 1-6, (1989); Barret, D.

The effect of quadriceps muscle force on a knee specimen loaded to anterior cruciate ligament failure during anterior tibial translation was studied in a human cadaveric model. In both knees from six donors, average age 41 years (range, 31 to 65), the joint capsule and ligaments, except the anterior cruciate ligament, were cut. The quadriceps tendon, patella, patellar tendon, and menisci were left intact. One knee from each pair was randomly selected to undergo destructive testing of the anterior cruciate ligament by anterior tibial translation at a displacement rate of 30 mm/sec with a simultaneously applied 889 N quadriceps muscle force. The knee flexion during testing was 30°. As a control, the contralateral knee was loaded correspondingly, but only 5 N of quadriceps muscle force was applied. The ultimate load for the knee to anterior cruciate ligament failure when tested with 889 N quadriceps muscle force was 22% ± 18% higher than that of knees tested with 5 N of force. The linear stiffness increased by 43% ± 30%. These results did not support the speculation that a quadriceps muscle contraction contributes to anterior cruciate ligament failure. In this model, the quadriceps muscle force protected the anterior cruciate ligament from injury during anterior tibial translation.","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; human; human tissue; joint function; knee injury; muscle contraction; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; skiing; sport injury; stress strain relationship","","","","","","","Aune, Arne Kristian, Effect of quadriceps or hamstring contraction on the anterior shear force to anterior cruciate ligament failure:an in vivo study in the rat, Acta Orthopaedica, 66, 3, pp. 261-265, (1995); Aune, Arne Kristian, Contraction of knee flexors and extensors in skiing related to the backward fall mechanism of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, 5, 3, pp. 165-169, (1995); Beynnon, Bruce D., The measurement of anterior cruciate ligament strain in vivo, International Orthopaedics, 16, 1, pp. 1-12, (1992); Butler, David L., Ligamentous restraints to anterior-posterior drawer in the human knee.

The operation was performed by two well trained surgeons. Subjective and objective evaluation was performed in each group preoperatively, at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. Isokinetic and isometric torque of the quadriceps and the hamstrings was measured with Cybex II. Muscle torque measured in the contralateral normal knee at the preoperative examination was defined as the reference value in each patient, and torque measured at each period was represented as a ratio (%) to the reference value. In the accelerated group, muscle torque of the quadriceps and the hamstrings increased to 100% or more of the reference value within 3 months after surgery. In the conventional group, however, it was restored to the same level of the reference value 9 months after surgery. After 12 months, there were no significant differences of muscle torque between the two groups. There were no significant differences concerning IKDC (international knee documentation committee) evaluation and anterior translation of the tibia measured under a drawer force of 133 N. Joint effusion was more frequently observed during rehabilitation in the accelerated group than in the conventional group (χ2 =3.89, p<0.05). Accelerated rehabilitation significantly increased effusion in the knee joint, although it increased muscle strength without deteriorating joint stability. This study indicates that postoperative rehabilitation should not be accelerated without limit because synovitis is frequently induced.","Accelerated rehabilitation; Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Hamstrings tendon","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; hamstring; human; joint effusion; ligament surgery; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; synovitis; tendon graft; torque","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00183377","","HSGZA","","Japanese","HOKKAIDO J.

Five consecutive patients (mean age, 12.9 years; range, 8 to 14 years) with radiographically documented 'wide' open growth plates and a minimum of 5 cm of expected remaining growth, underwent intraarticular reconstruction of the ACL. Operative treatment included three ACL reconstructions using hamstring tendons and two with quadriceps patellar tendon. All involved a centrally placed 6-mm or smaller tibial drill hole through an open physis and graft placement in an over-the- top position on the femur. At an average follow-up of 7.4 years (range, 4.5 to 9.9 years), no patient had a positive anterior drawer, Lachman, or pivot shift test. On KT-10013 arthrometer testing, all patients had 3 mm or less of increased anterior-posterior displacement (mean ± SD = 1.0 ± 1.6 mm). Magnetic resonance imaging showed that four tibial physes had fused in a symmetric fashion and one was still open. Orthoroentgenograms showed that no patient had a significant leg length discrepancy (-0.8 mm ± 3.4 mm). The mean increase in height postoperatively was 17.7 cm (range, 7.6 to 31.0 cm). Overall, using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form, there were four patients with grade A and one with grade C. The one patient with a poor IKDC grade had sustained a subsequent patellar dislocation with osteochondral fracture. In conclusion, ACL reconstruction using small drill holes placed through open tibial physes does not seem to adversely affect outcome or future growth.","ACL reconstruction; Operative treatment; Skeletally immature","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone maturation; bone radiography; clinical article; follow up; growth plate; hamstring; high risk patient; human; leg length inequality; ligament surgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; school child; sport injury; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Noyes, Frank R., The strength of the anterior cruciate ligament in humans and rhesus monkeys: Age related and species related changes, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 58, 8, pp. 1074-1082, (1976); J Bone Joint Surg Am, (1963); Kellenberger, R., Nonosseous lesions of the anterior cruciate ligaments in childhood and adolescence., Progress in pediatric surgery, 25, pp. 123-131, (1990); Andrews, Michelle, Anterior Cruciate Ligament Allograft Reconstruction in the Skeletally Immature Athlete, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 1, pp. 48-54, (1994); Angel, Kevin R., Anterior cruciate ligament injury in children and adolescents, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 5, 3, pp. 197-200, (1989); Paul Brief, L., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction without drill holes, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 7, 4, pp. 350-357, (1991); DeLee, Jesse C., Anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency in children, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 172, pp. 112-118, (1983); Engebretsen, Lars, Poor results of anterior cruciate ligament repair in adolescence, Acta Orthopaedica, 59, 6, pp. 684-686, (1988); Graf, Ben K., Anterior cruciate ligament tears in skeletally immature patients: Meniscal pathology at presentation and after attempted conservative treatment, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 2, pp. 229-233, (1992); Kannus, Pekka A., Knee ligament injuries in adolescents.

Eleven patients, 4 males and 7 females had surgery between July 1993 and April 1995. Their ages ranged from 16-48 years (33.82±10.68). The causes of injury was sport-related in 5 and traffic accident induced in 6 patients. All patients had endoscopic autogenous bone-patellar tendon- bone ACL reconstruction. The results were evaluated with physical examinations, KT-1000 arthrometer and Lysholm scores. The mean follow-up period was 26.8±6.7 months (20-33 months). Objective physical examinations done at the latest follow-up showed 1 patient had a 1-A Lachmann test, 3 patients had 1-A anterior drawer tests and 1 patient had a grade 1 pivot- shift test. Subjectively all patients rated the results as satisfactory, except the 1 patient with the grade 1 pivot-shift test, the result considered merely acceptable. Pre-operative KT-1000 maximum manual difference was 5.60±1.47 mm., which reduced to 1.60±0.65 mm at the latest follow-up. The pre-operative Lysholm score was 30.82±19.28 which improved to 87.19±9.38 at the latest follow-up. There was 1 patient who had an extension lag of 5 degrees and another had a flexion deficit (0-110 degrees). Ten patients still had quadriceps atrophy, 2.0±0.94 cm, at the latest follow-up. Though the number of cases was limited and the follow-up period was relatively short, the results were both satisfactory and encouraging.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft; endoscopic; reconstruction","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical article; endoscopic surgery; etiology; female; follow up; human; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; patient satisfaction; physical examination; preoperative evaluation; sport injury; surgical technique; tendon graft; traffic accident","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10116788","","CKKCD","","Chinese","J.

The patients, all after having their anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) surgically reconstructed in the same way, were divided into 2 groups by their follow-up periods; group B was tested for a mean period of 13, and group C for 55 weeks after surgery. The vertical jump test was performed on a special contact mattress connected with a computer. Evaluative variables in the one-legged and two-legged vertical jumps were contact time and height of jump. Besides the vertical jump tests, we also evaluated other functional tests (one-legged single hop, one-legged triple hop), rating scale (Lysholm,) and dynamometric measurements on a Cybex 6000 at a velocity of 15°/s. The limb symmetry index was calculated for single hop, triple hop, one-legged vertical jump, and peak torque. A significant relationship (p < 0.01) was found between the limb symmetry indices on single hop and triple hop, and those on vertical jump and triple hop in all 3 groups. Limb symmetry scores were 95% or more in group A, less than 76% in group B, and less than 91% in group C. The height of the one-legged vertical jump in group A is considered to be 50% of the two-legged vertical jump. The height of the two-legged vertical jump in groups B and C is the sum of the heights achieved in the one-legged jumps with involved and uninvolved legs. Our method allows to establish the function of the involved leg on the bases of two-legged, and one-legged vertical jumps of the uninvolved leg.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Functional tests; Muscle strength; One-legged vertical jump","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; functional assessment; human; jumping; ligament surgery; major clinical study; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10176721","","EPMRE","","English","EUR.

The effects of the brace were investigated in 40 patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction using an autogenous central third patellar tendon graft. The patients were randomized either to use the brace in the first 6 weeks postoperatively or to undertake the same accelerated rehabilitation programme but without any brace, and they were reviewed at 4 months postoperatively. The following data were recorded: passive and active extension and flexion deficits compared with the non-operated limb, KT-1000 assessment of anterior laxity and isometric quadriceps and hamstring strength. There was no difference between the two groups for any of the recorded variables. This was largely attributed to satisfactory tunnel placement and emphasis on the restoration of extension and quadriceps function during the early postoperative rehabilitation.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Extension deficit; Extension-assisting brace","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone transplantation; brace; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; equipment design; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; methodology; physiology; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Transplantation; Braces; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","Acknowledgement We acknowledge the generous support of the Australian Physiotherapy Research Foundation.","Aglietti, Paolo, Results of surgical treatment of arthrofibrosis after ACL reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 2, pp. 83-88, (1995); Am J Sports Med, (1991); Cosgarea, Andrew John, Prevention of Arthrofibrosis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Central Third Patellar Tendon Autograft, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 87-92, (1995); Dandy, David J., Problems in regaining full extension of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does arthrofibrosis exist?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 2, 2, pp. 76-79, (1994); Fisher, S.

The selected group (Lysholm-score, defined criteria) showed increasing recruitment (EMG-amplitudes and -median frequencies) at the involved atrophic M. quadriceps during each trainingsession. Improvement of 25% in peak torque and total work were on average measured from the first to last training set. Increasing myoelectrical activity (amplitude and median frequency) of the knee joint extensors and less increasing lactate values combined with better endurance indices suggest a preferential activation of small motor units (type I-fibres) at the beginning of the training. The increase of electromyographic amplitudes and median frequency with increase in peak torque and total set work during one trainingsession can be explained by increasing activation of larger motor units with higher treshold. Comparing to conventional training programs rehabilitative strength training programs have to be changed. In this case progression of intensity is necessary to adapt the load to the increasing power and to ensure a high training treshold and training effort. The sense of strength endurance training in rehabilitation has to be reconsidered critically.","EMG; Isokinetics; Muscle atrophy; Rehabilitation; Sportstherapy","","","","","","","","Die Muskulatur Sensibles Integratives Und Mebares Organ, (1994); Appell, Hans Joachim, Skeletal muscle atrophy during immobilization, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 7, 1, pp. 1-5, (1986); Banzer, Winfried E., Open and closed kinetic chain in rehabilitation after athletic injuries, Sportverletzung Sportschaden : Organ der Gesellschaft für Orthopädisch-Traumatologische Sportmedizin, 9, 3, pp. 98-100, (1995); Muscles Alive their Functions Revealed by Electromyography, (1985); Aktive Multigelenkssysteme Bedienungshandbuch, (1993); A Compendium of Isokinetics in Clinical Usage, (1992); Grundlagen Des Maximal Und Schnellkrafttrainings, (1985); Isokinetics Muscle Testing Interpretation and Clinical Applications, (1995); Edström, Lars, Effect of exercise on the motor unit, Muscle & Nerve, 9, 2, pp. 104-126, (1986); Krafttraining, (1995)","","","Dynamic Media Sales Verlag","","","","","","03445925","","","","German","Dtsch.

Reconstruction was performed in 172 athletes with ACL-deficient knees; in 32, a quadriceps tendon-patellar tendon substitute (QTS) was used; in 79, semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (STG) were used; and in 61, a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BTB) was used. For QTS and STG autografts, a ligament augmentation device was used. Each group received the same accelerated rehabilitation program. Muscle strength was measured periodically 3-18 months after the operation, using a Cybex II dynamometer (Cybex Division of Lumex, Ronkonkoma, NY, USA). Knee extensor strength was evaluated, using the side-to-side ratio and the body weight ratio, to give a precise assessment of permissible sporting activity. After a period of 1 year, the percentage of athletes who recovered their extensor muscle strength at a level more than 80% of that in the uninvolved knee was 15.6% for those with QTS grafts, 41.0% for those with BTB grafts, and 77.9% for those with STG grafts (P < 0.001 between QTS and STG, P < 0.05 between QTS and BTB, and P < 0.001 between BTB and STG). The body weight ratio in men showed that, after reconstruction, recovery of extensor muscle strength sufficient for participation in vigorous sport required 6 months for STG grafts, 12 months for BTB grafts, and 18 months for QTS grafts. © The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Athlete; Body weight ratio; Extensor muscle strength","","","","","","","","Barrett, Gene R., Comparison of patella tendon versus patella tendon/kennedy ligament augmentation device for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Study of results, morbidity, and complications, Arthroscopy, 9, 6, pp. 624-632, (1993); Evaluation of Knee Extensor Strength for Prevention of Sports Injury, (1987); Kramer, John F., Knee flexor and extensor strength during concentric and eccentric muscle actions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the semitendinosus tendon and ligament augmentation device, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 285-291, (1993); Brant Lipscomb, A., Evaluation of hamstring strength following use of semitendinosus and gracilis tendons to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 6, pp. 340-342, (1982); Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); Marder, Richard A., Prospective evaluation of arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

In both knees of 20 rats the joint capsule and ligaments, except the ACL, were cut and the menisci resected by microsurgery. The rats were randomized to destructive testing of their ACLs either by femorotibial distraction or by anterior tibial translation at a displacement rate of 2.5 mm s-1 (60% s-1). The knee flexion during testing was 60°. During loading of the right ACL, quadriceps contraction was induced by electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve. As control, the ACL of the left knee was loaded with relaxed quadriceps. The ultimate load for the knee to ACL failure when tested in tension by femorotibial distraction during quadriceps contraction was 140% higher than tested with the muscles relaxed (p = 0.0001). Energy absorption at failure during muscle contraction was 274% higher (p = 0.0001), and the linear stiffness increased by 59% (p = 0.0004). During testing by anterior tibial translation, neither linear stiffness nor ultimate load changed significantly, but the energy absorbed at failure was 46% (p = 0.02) higher during quadriceps contraction compared to testing with the quadriceps relaxed. These results showed that quadriceps contraction substantially increased the load carrying capacity of the rat knee subject to ACL failure when loaded by femorotibial distraction, but less when it was loaded by anterior tibial translation.","Anterior cruciate ligament failure; In vivo destructive testing; Muscle contraction; Rat model","Bone; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Joints (anatomy); Loads (forces); Mechanical testing; Muscle; Stiffness; Surgery; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior tibial translation; In vivo destructive testing; In vivo study; Knee flexion; Microsurgery; Quadriceps contraction; Rat; Ligaments; animal experiment; animal model; anterior cruciate ligament; article; controlled study; electrostimulation; femoral nerve; joint capsule; knee; knee function; knee meniscus; loading test; male; meniscectomy; muscle contraction; nerve stimulation; nonhuman; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; rat","","","","","","","Aune, Arne Kristian, Hamstrings and gastrocnemius co‐contraction protects the anterior cruciate ligament against failure: An in vivo study in the rat, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 13, 1, pp. 147-150, (1995); Beynnon, Bruce D., The measurement of anterior cruciate ligament strain in vivo, International Orthopaedics, 16, 1, pp. 1-12, (1992); Butler, David L., Ligamentous restraints to anterior-posterior drawer in the human knee.

Five extensions and flexions at lower speed (60°/s) and 15 repetitions at higher speed (240°/s) were performed. Gravity-corrected peak torque values for flexion and extension were obtained. and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratios (H/Q) were calculated at both speeds. Compared with the control group, the uninjured legs of the injury group showed 8% weaker quadriceps muscles and 14% higher H/Q ratios at higher speed. The other between-group comparisons were not significant. These differences could have been developed by strength reduction after the injury in the noninjured limb due-to-insufficient rehabilitation, by a weaker musculature in the patient group already initially, or by both mechanisms. If the second option is true, the finding may indicate that weak quadriceps musculature is one of the risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

Seventy of these patients were re-examined 2 to 5 years after the operation (mean 3.5 years), the examination consisting of a questionnaire, clinical examination, laxity tests with the KSS machine (Acufex), radiological examination and isokinetic muscle strength testing (Cybex 6000). There were 32 men and 38 women (mean age 34 years). The injury was sustained in sports in 44 (63%) cases, and the sports most frequently involved were downhill skiing (18 cases), soccer (9 cases) and volleyball (5 cases). Of the injuries, 38 were isolated ACL ruptures and 31, ACL ruptures combined with a medial CL rupture. In 9 cases, an additional meniscus injury and in one case an additional posterior CL - lateral CL rupture was found. At the follow-up, 55 patients (79%) were satisfied with the end result, and according to our objective functional criteria 55 (79%) had an excellent or good outcome. According to the Lysholm score, 53 (76%) patients were excellent or good (≥ 82 points). In the Lachman test, 29 knees (41%) were completely stable. The Lachman test was mildy positive in 40 knees (57%) (36 had 1+ laxity and 4, 2+ laxity), and one patient had 3+ laxity with a hard end-point. Similarly, the anterior drawer test was negative in 53 knees (76%), and the other 17 (24%) had mild laxity (16 had 1+ laxity and 1, 2+ laxity). The total anterior-posterior laxity measured with the KSS averaged 9.7 ± 3.5 mm in the injured knee and 7.3 + 3.0 mm in the uninjured knee (the laxity measured at a knee angle of 20° of flexion). Corresponding values at a knee angle of 90° of flexion were 6.1 ± 2.4 mm and 4.7 ± 1.9 mm, respectively. The pivot shift test was negative in 62 patients (89%) and 1+ positive in the remaining 8 patients (11%). Fifty-eight patients (83%) had full knee extension and 40 patients (57%), full knee flexion. Compared with the uninjured knee, the operated knees showed an average 14% strength deficit in isokinetic knee extension and 6% deficit in flexion at the speed of 60°/s. At the speed of 180°/s, the corresponding deficits were 8% and 4%, respectively. Of the 44 patients who were active in sport before the injury, 40 (91%) were able to return to sports. A flexion deficit of 5° or more was associated with thigh muscle atrophy (P < 0.05) and quadriceps weakness, both at the slow speed (P < 0.05) and high speed (P < 0.001) of the isokinetic movement. In conclusion, in an acute rupture of the ACL, primary repair of the ligament with intraarticular iliotibial band augmentation seems to be a good method to restore the functional capacity of the injured knee.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical examination; female; follow up; football; human; joint laxity; knee function; knee meniscus rupture; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; patient satisfaction; priority journal; questionnaire; skiing; sport injury; surgical technique; suturing method; treatment outcome; Acute Disease; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Fascia Lata; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Rupture; Suture Techniques","","","","","","","Andersson, Christer A., Treatment of acute isolated and combined ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament: A long-term follow-up study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 7-12, (1992); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

The study subjects were 119 patients who had had a complete rupture of the ACL and had been treated surgically at the Tampere University Hospital between 1981 and 1990. They were divided into the acute group (N = 62) and into the chronic group (N = 57) according to the time delay between the injury and the ACL surgery. The isokinetic strength measurements of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were performed on average 4 years after the operation using Cybex II and Cybex 6000 dynamometers (Lumex Inc., Ronkokoma, NY, USA). The peak torques were determined at speeds of 60 and 180°/s and the peak work at speed of 180°/s. The measurements revealed that after the ACL surgery there was still a considerable thigh muscle strength deficit especially in extension of the injured extremity, the average extension strength deficit ranging from 9 to 20 %. The extension strength deficit was significantly more prominent in the chronic (18-20 %) than in the acute group (9-15 %). The extension strength deficit was also significantly greater at the slower (15-20 %) than higher (9-18 %) speed of the isokinetic movement. In both the acute and chronic groups, a multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that patellofemoral pain and flexion deficit of the knee were the factors that most frequently and significantly associated with the strength deficits. At the higher speed of the isokinetic movement, these two factors accounted 20 % and 21 % for the variation seen in the quadriceps strength deficit of the acute group and the chronic group. No correlation could be found between age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, length of the follow-up time, injury type, athletic activity level, immobilization method, knee stability, and the isokinetic muscular performance.","ACL surgery; Isokinetic testing; Muscle performance; Rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthralgia; article; body mass; body weight; dynamometry; female; hamstring; height; human; joint limitation; joint stability; knee surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; patellofemoral joint; postoperative period; quadriceps femoris muscle; regression analysis; thigh; torque; treatment outcome; Acute Disease; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Chronic Disease; Evaluation Studies; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Forecasting; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Pain; Patella; Physical Therapy Modalities; Range of Motion, Articular; Regression Analysis; Rupture; Stress, Mechanical; Thigh; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Sixteen patients had isolated posterior cruciate ligament ruptures, 16 had complex injuries with capsular and collateral ligament involvement, and 21 had additional anterior cruciate ligament ruptures. Forty-six patients were treated by transosseous multiple-loop sutures and seven with bony avulsions by screw osteosynthesis. The mean follow-up time was 7.5 years (range, 3 to 12). All patients were examined subjectively (questionnaire) and objectively (clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer, functional testing, radiographs, and Cybex II isokinetic strength analysis). The results were graded according to the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form and the Lysholm score. The average Lysholm score was 82.4 (range, 40 to 100). Thirty-eight patients returned to their preinjury activities at the same intensity level. The patients' subjective assessments were normal or nearly normal in 35 patients. The posterior drawer test was negative or 1+ in 46 patients. Cybex isokinetic strength analysis revealed a decrease in quadriceps muscle strength of the involved limb by 10.5% (P < 0.01). Our data suggest that primary repair of posterior cruciate ligament ruptures provides good results after 8 years in approximately two thirds of the patients. Distal ligamentous ruptures, lack of athletic activity, and temporary olecranization correlated with poor results. Bony avulsions, midsubstance or proximal ruptures, and athletic activity correlated with good results.","","adult; article; clinical examination; complication; deep vein thrombosis; female; fibrosis; follow up; hematoma; human; knee function; knee ligament injury; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; osteosynthesis; physical activity; priority journal; questionnaire; sport injury; suturing method; traffic accident; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Årøen, Asbjorn, Primary suture of the posterior cruciate ligament, Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening, 112, 12, pp. 1582-1584, (1992); Barrett, Gene R., Operative management of acute PCL injuries with associated pathology: Long-term results, Orthopedics, 14, 6, pp. 687-692, (1991); Burri, Caius, Experimental basis for postoperative treatment after suture and replacement of ligaments of the knee joint, Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und Ihre Grenzgebiete, 111, 4, pp. 378-379, (1973); Clancy, William G., Treatment of knee joint instability secondary to rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament.

Recent studies support the use of smaller interference screws and endoscopic technique, as well as an accelerated rehabilitation program that emphasizes early weight bearing, early knee extension, and protected range of motion. Efforts are being made to speed the recovery of quadriceps femoris strength, in an effort to facilitate rehabilitation of the surgically reconstructed leg. Information on mea sures to decrease the incidence of postoperative arthrofibrosis continue to be published. The behavior of graft tissue with respect to revascularization or repopulation has been further described.

Although subjective reports favoring bracing are plentiful, objective proof of significant control of tibial translation is not. This in vivo study was designed to assess the effect of six popular braces on anterior tibial translation, isokinetic performance, and neuromuscular function in five chronically unstable anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees. A knee stress test was performed on a specially designed device that allowed free tibial movement while monitoring anterior tibial translation and muscle function in the quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscles. Results show that braces can decrease anterior tibial translation between 28.8% and 39.1% without the stabilizing contractions of the hamstring, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles. With lower extremity muscle activation and bracing, anterior tibial translation was decreased between 69.8% and 84.9%. Some improvement in spinal level muscle reaction times was seen with brace use, especially in the quadriceps muscle. Unfortunately, most braces appear to consistently slow hamstring muscle reaction times at the voluntary level.","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; brace; clinical article; exercise test; gastrocnemius muscle; hamstring; human; kinetics; knee injury; ligament injury; muscle contraction; muscle function; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; reaction time","","","","","","","Bagger, J., Effect of functional bracing, quadriceps and hamstrings on anterior tibial translation in anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency: A preliminary study, Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development, 29, 1, pp. 9-12, (1992); Baker, Bruce E., A biomechanical study of the static stabilizing effect of knee braces on medial stability, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 6, pp. 566-570, (1987); Bassett, George S., The Lenox Hill Brace in anterolateral rotatory instability, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 11, 5, pp. 345-348, (1983); Beck, Charles L., Instrumented testing of functional knee braces, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 4, pp. 253-256, (1986); Trans 41st Orthop Res Soc, (1995); Beynnon, Bruce D., The effect of functional knee-braces on strain on the anterior cruciate ligament in vivo, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 74, 9, pp. 1298-1312, (1992); Bonamo, John J., The conservative treatment of the anterior cruciate deficient knee, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 6, pp. 618-623, (1990); Branch, Thomas P., Dynamic EMG analysis of anterior cruciate deficient legs with and without bracing during cutting, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 35-41, (1989); Branch, Thomas P., Controlling anterior tibial displacement under static load: A comparison of two braces, Orthopedics, 11, 9, pp. 1249-1252, (1988); Butler, Penelope B., A review of selected knee orthoses, Rheumatology, 22, 2, pp. 109-120, (1983)","","","SAGE Publications Inc. claims@sagepub.com","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","8827316","English","AM.

It was suggested that the tension of the joint capsule may reduce tibial displacement although the ACL is completely disrupted. In 10 cadaver knee joints the ACL was dissected and the capsule was closed again. By a canula the knee joints were filled with isotonic saline solution in steps of 20 ml up to 100 ml. Before and after dissection of the ACL and during filling the joint we measured the anterior tibial displacement by use of the MEDmetric KT1000 arthrometer. In a second series we examined 5 patients with acute effusion of the knee joint before and after puncture of the effusion. We detected the electromyographic activity of the quadriceps muscle and the hamstrings during the KT1000 test and patellar reflex. In the cadaver tests we found no reduction of the anterior tibial translation while filling the joint with saline solution. The electromyographic examinations showed a reflectory action in the quadriceps muscle and in the hamstrings when the Lachman test was performed. In the quadriceps muscle the electromyographic amplitude was reduced after puncture: the hamstrings showed a drastically reduced amplitude and duration of the signal. When patellar reflex was performed we recorded an electromyographic action in both muscle groups, too. Puncture could only reduce the signals of the hamstrings. Our results suggest that the reduction of the anterior drawer and the Lachman test in acute effusion is caused not mechanically by the tension of the capsule but by a reflectory muscle action of the hamstrings.","ACL rupture; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; biomechanics; electromyographic examination; knee joint effusion; proprioception","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; biomechanics; clinical article; electromyography; human; human experiment; joint effusion; knee arthrography","","","","","","","DeAndrade, J.

Initial postoperative evaluations included serial creatinine phosphokinase determinations. At 1 and 6 months postoperatively, the electromyographic examination was repeated and thigh and calf girth measurements were obtained. At 6 months and 1 year after surgery, the following evaluations were made: thigh and calf girth, KT-1000 arthrometric testing, isokinetic testing of quadriceps and hamstring muscles, single-legged hop test for time, single- legged hop test for distance, and the Lysholm knee score. In Group I, the tourniquet was inflated for an average of 87 minutes, with an average pressure of 269 mm Hg.

We recruited four subject groups: elite female (N = 40) and male (N = 60) athletes and sex-matched nonathletic controls (N = 40). All participants underwent a subjective evaluation of knee function, arthrometer measurement of anterior tibial translation, isokinetic dynamometer strength and endurance tests at 60 and 240 deg/sec, and anterior tibial translation stress tests. Dynamic stress testing of muscles demonstrated less anterior tibial translation in the knees of the athletes (both men and women) compared with the nonathletic controls. Female athletes and controls demonstrated more anterior tibial laxity than their male counterpads and significantly less muscle strength and endurance. Compared with the male athletes, the female athletes took significantly longer to generate maximum hamstring muscle torque during isokinetic testing. Although no significant differences were found in either spinal or cortical muscle reaction times, the muscle recruitment order in some female athletes was markedly different. The female athletes appeared to rely more on their quadriceps muscles in response to anterior tibial translation; the three other test groups relied more on their hamstring muscles for initial knee stabilization.","","adult; article; athlete; female; functional assessment; hamstring; human; human experiment; knee injury; male; muscle contraction; muscle exercise; muscle function; muscle strength; normal human; priority journal","","","","","","","Abbott, H.

Functional evaluation with Lysholm knee and Tegner activity level scores were done. Antero-posterior (AP) knee laxity correlated negatively with Tegner activity level (NS), and insignificantly with Lysholm knee score. A marginal correlation was found between the Lysholm score and muscle strength. Patients were divided into four groups depending on whether their AP laxity was greater or less than 20 mm and whether their quadriceps strength was greater or less than 85% of their control knee. No difference in the Lysholm or Tenger scores between the groups was observed.

It involved 171 operations, 113 men and 58 women aged between 15 and 49 years (average 26 years), the majority of whom were active in sports both at competition (51 cases) and at recreational level (119 cases). There were 101 lesions of the medial meniseus (58.4%) and 94 lesions of the lateral meniscus (54.4%); only 41 knees had no meniscal lesion (23.6%). The results at medium term (between 4 and 8 years follow-up) were based on 107 cases (61.8%). The tolerance of the reinforcement was excellent as there were no instances of either acute or chronic synovitis in this series. The anatomical results evaluated using the Lachmann test (maximum manual Lachmann) showed no differential in 24 cases (22.8%), a differential of between 0 and 2 mm in 54 cases (50.5%), of between 2 and 4 mm in 20 cases (19%) and of >4 mm in 9 cases (8.7%). The functional results evaluated using the Arpège CLAS system showed 83% of results to be satisfactory (score >23). The radiological results showed that 63 knees (58.9%) had no subclinical or clinical signs of medial or lateral femorotibial osteoarthritis. In total, with an average follow-up of >5 years (4-8 years), it was found that the MacIntosh quadricepsplasty reinforced with the Kennedy LAD was not accompanied by any iatrogenic disease. The anatomical results were completely satisfactory (knees nearly normal) in 72.9% of cases, and the radiological results showed normal knees in 58.9% of cases. As for the functional results, they were identical to those obtained using many other techniques. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Kennedy ligament augmentation device; Ligamentoplasty; MacIntosh technique","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; human; injury; joint instability; knee injury; male; methodology; orthopedics; postoperative complication; prostheses and orthoses; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Human; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Age; Orthopedics; Postoperative Complications; Prostheses and Implants; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Rev Chir Orthop, (1992); Les Laxites Chroniques Du Genou, (2013); Caton, J., Patellae inferae, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 68, 5, pp. 317-325, (1982); Dejour, Henri, Results of the treatment of anterior laxity of the knee, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 69, 4, pp. 255-302, (1983); Dejour, Henri, Results of operated chronic anterior laxities. 251 cases reviewed with a minimum 3 year follow-up, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 74, 7, pp. 622-636, (1988); Trans Orthop Res Soc, (1990); Ligament and Extensor Mechanism Injuries of the Knee, (1991); Rev Chir Orthop, (1992); Hanley, P., Load sharing and graft forces in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions with the Ligament Augmentation Device., The American journal of sports medicine, 17, 3, pp. 414-422, (1989); Ligamentoplastie Sous Arthroscopie Dans Les Laxites Anterieures Chroniques Du Genou Technique Personnelle A Partir Du Procede De Macintosh, (1984)","","","Springer-Verlag","","","","","","09422056","","","7553011","English","Knee Surg, Sports traumatol, Arthroscopy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029177720"

The linear relationships for paired strength and endurance differences between ITD and LEB were found to be acceptable for the operated group. The LEB alone explained 57% and 38% of the ITD outcome for strength and endurance, respectively. The agreement between observed and predicted ITD values based on the LEB measurements was found satisfactory with a positive standardized agreement index.

Anterior tibial displacement in normal knees increased steadily as the knee was extended from 60° flexion reaching a maximum at 20° flexion for active motion and 25° flexion during isokinetic exercising. In ACL-deficient knees anterior tibial translation was significantly greater than for normal knees, reaching a maximum of 15° during both active motion and isokinetic exercising. The values for isokinetic exercising were greater than those noted during active exercising in both groups.

Twentytwo patients with a chronic anterior instability underwent a modified Marshall-MacIntosh procedure, while 27 with a subacute torn ACL had an ACL reconstruction using a free bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. The patients were retrospectively reviewed with a 1.8-year average followup (1-3 years). The clinical result was evaluated through the comparative range of motion and the residual laxity as measured with the KT 1000 arthrometer. The roentgenographic analysis was performed from anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) views, made first on one-leg standing with the knee at 30° of flexion, and secondly at ""zero"" extension with active quadriceps contraction. Lines were drawn to visualise the location of the tibial and femoral tunnels in relation to the tibial plateaus and the intercondylar roof represented by Blumensaat's line. The analysis of the lateral MRI views of the graft allowed discrimination between homogenous and heterogenous graft signals. On lateral roentgenograms of normal knees, it was found that Blumensaat's line crossed the surface of the medial tibial plateau at 30%±9% of its sagittal width (20%-40% range), demonstrating the variability of intercondylar roof inclination. The range of motion was normal in 34 patients (group I), 9 patients had a flexion deficit (group II), and 6 exhibited an extension deficit (group III). The residual laxity was similar in each group (P>0.05). When comparing group III to group I, patients from the former group had a tibial tunnel significantly more anterior with regard to Blumensaat's line (P=0.02). In group III, all patients exhibited a heterogenous MRI graft signal (P<0.05). and the angle between the intra-articular part of the graft and the tibial tunnel was higher (P<0.001). These findings were not observed in group II where the location only of the femoral tunnel seemed to influence the flexion deficit (P<0.05). This study demonstrated that the location of the tibial tunnel with regard to the intercondylar roof, when the knee is at ""zero"" extension, was the most relevant parameter in control of the extension deficit resulting from a graft impingement. No relation was found between the tibial tunnel location with regard to the tibial plateaus and the mobility deficit. Also, graft impingement was always associated with a heterogenous graft MRI signal.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: twenty one patients having a chronic anterior instability sustained a modified Marshall-Mac Intosh procedure, while 15 having a subacute torn ACL had an ACL reconstruction using a free bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. The patients were retrospectively reviewed with a 1.8 year average follow-up (1-3 years). The clinical result was evaluated through the comparative range of motion, the residual laxity as measured with the KT 1000 arthrometer, and the pivot shift test. The roentgenographic analysis was performed from AP and ML views, made first on one-leg standing with the knee at 30 degrees of flexion, and then in ""zero"" extension with active quadriceps contraction. Lines were drawn to visualise the location of the tibial and femoral tunnels in relation to the tibial plateaus and the roof of the intercondylar notch represented by the Blumensaat line. The analysis of the AP IRM views of the graft allowed to discriminate between homogeneous and heterogeneous graft signals. RESULTS: on lateral roentgenograms of normal knees it was found that the Blumensaat line crossed the surface of the medial tibial plateau at its anterior third, at 30 +/- 9 per cent (20-40 per cent range), demonstrating the variability of the intercondylar roof inclination. The range of motion was normal in 22 patients (group 1), 8 patients had a flexion deficit (group II), and 6 exhibited an extension deficit (group III). The residual laxity was similar in each group (p > 0.05). When comparing group III to group I, patients from group III had a tibial tunnel significantly more anterior with regard to the Blumensaat line (p < 0.02). In group III, all patients exhibited an heterogeneous MRI graft signal (p < 0.05), and the angle between the intraarticular part of the graft and the tibial tunnel was higher (p < 0.001). These findings were not observed in group II where the location only of the femoral tunnel seemed to influence the flexion deficit (p > 0.05). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: this study demonstrated that the location of the tibial tunnel with regard to the roof of the intercondylar notch, when the knee is in ""zero"" extension, was the most relevant parameter controlling the extension deficit resulting from a graft impingement. No relation was found between the tibial tunnel location with regard to the tibial plateaus and the mobility deficit.

Instrumented laxity testing proved to be closely correlated with the pivot shift test (r=0.54, p<0.001) and the Lachman test (r=0.73, p<0.001), but offered a far better resolution.

Simulation of vertical stance in a quadriceps-stabilized knee was performed. Internal and external rotational torques were applied before and after anterior cruciate ligament sectioning. Pivot shift tests were done in the intact and anterior cruciate ligament sectioned knee. Results of pivot shift tests were all negative before sectioning and positive after isolated sectioning. No significant change in axial ro tation occurred between the intact and sectioned knee for external rotation (P = 0.24) or internal rotation (P = 0.12). Presence of a load at the femoral housing in both the intact and ligament-sectioned knees caused a significant change in external rotation (P < 0.0001). No significant change was noted in internal rotation between loaded and unloaded states (P = 0.70). Total tibial rotation in the intact knee was noted to vary between 31 ° at 0° of flexion and 42° at 60° of flexion. These results suggest that the anterior cruciate ligament does not play a significant role in limiting axial rotation and that rotational instability is not a major factor after isolated anterior cruciate liga ment rupture. © 1994, SAGE Publications.

However, not much is known about the strain these exercises place on the passive restraining mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of progressive loading of the knee extensors on anterior tibial translation during weight-bearing and nonweight- bearing isometric exercise. Fourteen subjects diagnosed as ACL-deficient via arthroscopic surgery participated in the study. An arthrometer was used to measure anterior tibial translation during weight-bearing and nonweight- bearing exercises with the knee in 20° of flexion and with a quadriceps load equivalent to 25, 50, 75, and 100% of body weight. Hamstring muscle activations during all testing were monitored to eliminate the possibility of substantial cocontractions. During the weight-bearing exercise, anterior tibial translation was found to be significantly less than that measured during the Lachman's evaluation and the 50, 75, and 100% nonweight-bearing exercises. For the nonweight-bearing exercises, anterior tibial translation was either equivalent to or greater than the Lachman's evaluation. During the weight-bearing exercises, anterior tibial translation was not different under the different loading conditions. During the nonweight-bearing exercises, anterior tibial translation progressively increased with increased loading. The results from this study imply that weight-bearing exercises minimize strain to the passive restraining structures whereas nonweight-bearing exercises will strain these structures, and the magnitude of this strain appears to be proportional to the knee extensor moment.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; clinical article; electromyogram; female; hamstring; human; isometric exercise; knee; knee arthroscopy; male; quadriceps femoris muscle; tibia; weight bearing","","","","","","","","","","Movement Science Media","","","","","","01906011","","JOSPD","7827632","English","J.

Exercises in water have been shown to be effective for improving strength and passive range of motion (PROM). Traditional rehabilitation following intra-articular anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has taken place on land. This study was designed to compare the effects of exercises in water on strength and girth of the thigh musculature, knee PROM, joint laxity, effusion, and functional outcome with the effects of similar exercises on land in subjects following intra- articular reconstruction of the ACL. Subjects. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to either a group that exercised on land or a group that exercised in water. Methods. Thigh girth, joint effusion, and knee PROM measurements were recorded at 2-week intervals for the first 8 weeks post-operatively. Isokinetic and isometric peak torque measurements for the thigh musculature, knee joint laxity assessments, and Lysholm scores were obtained at the end of 8 weeks. Results. Higher outcome scores were recorded in the water group than in the land group, as measured by Lysholm scales. No differences were noted between groups for knee PROM, thigh girth, or quadriceps femoris muscle performance. In the water group, less joint effusion was noted after the 8 weeks. In the land group, greater peak torque for isokinetic knee flexion was recorded. Conclusion and Discussion. Although exercise in water may not be as effective as exercise on land for regaining maximum muscle performance, rehabilitation in water may minimize the amount of joint effusion and lead to greater self-reports of functional improvement in subjects with intra- articular ACL reconstructions.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; functional assessment; human; isokinetic exercise; joint function; male; muscle function; muscle mass; muscle strength; postoperative period; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; torque; water flow","","","","","","","","","","American Physical Therapy Association subscriptions@apta.org","","","","","","00319023","","PTHEA","8047560","English","PHYS.

Analyzing bilateral symmetry and agonist/antagonist ratios of the lower extremity, this method is a useful index for the objective evaluation of ligament-deficient knees. 106 patients with a chronic ACL deficient knee sustained a presurgery isokinetic evaluation. 94 patients had a post-operative evaluation and 13 a pre and post-surgery evaluation. All patients were simultaneously evaluated by clinical examination and measures of instrumental knee laxity (KT 1000). Results showed that isokinetic performance was not correlated to the objective laxity as measured with the KT 1000 but was correlated to 1) the type of laxity (i.e. associated postero-lateral laxity), 2) the functional level of activity, and 3) the time of disability. Best functional results were obtained in patients whose injured knee hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio was close to the uninjured knee H/Q ratio. The mean quadriceps deficit was over 15 per cent for 75 per cent of the patients one year after surgery, and for 50 per cent of the patients after two years. The quadriceps deficit was not parallel to the length of the autograft taken from the extensor mechanism. Isokinetic evaluation is a guideline for rehabilitation allowing specific strengthening of the weaker muscular groups.","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; electrophysiology; female; follow up; human; injury; joint instability; kinetics; knee; male; muscle atrophy; pathophysiology; postoperative period; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electrophysiology; English Abstract; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Joint Instability; Kinetics; Knee Joint; Male; Muscular Atrophy; Postoperative Period","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00351040","","","7938807","French","Rev Chir Orthop Reparatrice Appar Mot","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0001670672"

Fifty-two consecutive arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstructions (Group I) were matched with 52 miniarthrotomy ACL reconstructions (Group II). An autogenous midthird patellar tendon was used in all reconstruction procedures. Group I patients were operated on by one surgeon (A.C.R.) and all Group II patients by another (K.D.S.). Both groups were similar with regard to age, sex, injury, chronicity, and previous knee surgical procedures. All patients were treated according to the same postoperative rehabilitative protocol (emphasizing early motion, immediate full passive extension, early functional activity) and evaluated on follow-up by the same personnel and protocol. Data collection included injury and surgery dates; total surgery and tourniquet times; length of hospital stay; drain output; inpatient pain medications used; follow-up range of motion at 1.5, 2.5, and 6 weeks postoperative; KT-1000 arthrometer measurements at 10, 16, and 26 weeks; and isokinetic measurements at 10 and 16 weeks postoperative. Results indicated that follow-up range of motion and KT-1000 measurements showed no statistical difference between groups. Isokinetic average scores for quadriceps strength at 180°/s showed no differences at 10 and 16 weeks. The study suggested that ACL reconstructtion with midthird patellar tendon performed by skilled surgeons using either open or arthroscopic-assisted techniques combined with an aggressive postoperative rehabilitation protocol will yield similar acceptable early clinical results. © 1993, Arthroscopy Association of North America.

An electrogoniometer system was applied to the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee of 11 volunteers and to the uninvolved normal knee in 9 of these volunteers. Anterior tibial displacement and the knee flexion angle were measured during each exercise using matched quadriceps loads and during the Lachman test. The anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee had significantly greater anterior tibial displacement during extension from 64° to 10° in the knee extension exercise as compared to the parallel squat exercise. In addition, the amount of displacement during the Lachman test was significantly less than in the knee extension exercise, but significantly more than in the parallel squat exercise. No significant differences were found between measurements in the normal knee. We concluded that the stress to the anterior cruciate ligament, as indicated by anterior tibial displacement, is minimized by using the parallel squat, a closed kinetic chain exercise, when compared to the relative anterior tibial displacement during knee extension exercise.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; goniometry; human; kinesiotherapy; knee dislocation; knee function; knee injury; ligament injury; male; priority journal; stress; tibia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","8267687","English","AM.

Anterior shear loading of the tibia in relation to the fixed femur at 30° of knee flexion (Lachman test), produced significantly greater strain values in comparison to anterior shear loading at 90° (Anterior Drawer test). During isometric quadriceps contraction a significant increase in AMB strain was measured with the knee flexed to 30°, while no significant change was measured at 90°. For quadriceps contraction there were significantly higher values of AMB strain measured at 30° of knee flexion in comparison to that observed at 90°. For active range of motion (AROM) the AMB was strained between 10° and 48°, and unstrained between 48° and 110°. During passive range of motion (PROM) the AMB remained unstrained until the joint was brought into extension. There were significant differences in strain values found between AROM and PROM at the flexion angles 10°, 20°, 30° and 40°, while between 50° and 110° there were no significant differences. These results confirm previous studies that the Lachman test is a superior technique in comparison to the classic anterior drawer test for evaluating the AMB. They suggest that isometric quadriceps activity at 90° of knee flexion can be prescribed for rehabilitation immediately after ACL reconstruction. These data indicate that AROM (between the limits of 50° and 110°) and PROM may also be performed with minimal risk of strain to a reconstructive replacement. The PROM data may also serve as an important standard for the reconstruction of the ACL. © 1992 Springer Verlag.","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; epidemiology; human; isometric exercise; male; strain gauge transducer; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopes; Arthroscopy; Biomechanics; Human; Isometric Contraction; Knee Joint; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Stress, Mechanical; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Transducers","","","","","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R01AR039213)","","undefined; Arms, Steven W., The biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation and reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 8-18, (1984); undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; Bartel, Donald L., Surgical repositioning of the medical collateral ligament.

A two-way analysis of variance was carried out to determine if there were significant differences between the peak torque values for the quadriceps and hamstrings muscle groups in the operated and non-operated (control) limbs. Results indicated that there were no significant differences between the control and operated limbs with regard to both quadriceps and hamstrings torques, although a trend was noted of lower values in peak torque for both quadriceps and hamstrings in the operated limb.

The KT-1000 maximum measurements (30 to 40 pounds) averaged an increase of 1.7 mm when compared with the opposite knee. Subjective complaints, such as anterior knee pain, grating, and weakness, were common and only 3 of 10 patients returned to all of their preinjury sports. Persistent radiographic abnormalities were common. Physical examination and functional testing also revealed persistent dysfunction of the extensor mechanism in patients with radiographic abnormalities. Isokinetic testing at 60 deg/sec showed an average quadriceps deficit of 18% compared to the normal extremity. Axial computed tomography scans revealed significant decrease in quadriceps cross-sectional area. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography confirmed persistent defects at the harvest site; there was significant anterior knee scar formation in these patients.

For the measurements, the Cybex II dynamometer was used. In hamstrings, the mean peak torque angle was 35 deg of knee flexion, when the angular speed of the dynamometer was 60 deg/sec. At 180 deg/sec, the angle appeared 8 deg later in the range of motion, at 43 deg (p < 0.001). In quadriceps, the average peak torque angle was 54 deg at 60 deg/sec. At 180 deg/sec, the angle occurred 10 deg later, at 44 deg of knee flexion (p < 0.001). Within each injury group, there were no significant differences between the injured and uninjured limb. The type of the knee ligament injury (grade II or III anterior cruciate, medial collateral or lateral collateral ligament injury, or grade I combination injury) also did not affect the results. However, the muscle strength of the weak muscle groups (that is, hamstrings in all the other injury groups except anterior cruciate ligament group) had a significant negative correlation with the angle of peak torque. This meant that in these hamstrings, the peak torque angle occurred later in the range of motion when muscle strength decreased, and vice versa. © 1991 Butterworth–Heinemann.","Knee injuries; Ligaments; Muscle performance","","","","","","","","Baltzopoulos, Vasilios, Isokinetic Dynamometry: Applications and Limitations, Sports Medicine, 8, 2, pp. 101-116, (1989); Borges, Octavia, Isometric and isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque in men and women aged 20-70, Scandinavian Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, 21, 1, pp. 45-53, (1989); Costain, R., Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring torque levels of adolescent, female soccer players, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 5, 4, pp. 196-200, (1984); Bmdp Statistical Software 1981, (1981); Fillyaw, Michael J., Importance of correcting isokinetic peak torque for the effect of gravity when calculating knee flexor to extensor muscle ratios, Physical Therapy, 66, 1, pp. 23-31, (1986); J Bone Joint Surg Br, (1972); Gilliam, Thomas B., Isokinetic torque levels for High School football players, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 60, 3, pp. 110-114, (1979); Goslin, Brian R., Isokinetic dynamometry: Normative data for clinical use in lower extremity (knee) cases, Scandinavian Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, 11, 3, pp. 105-109, (1979); Hislop, Helen J., The isokinetic concept of exercise., Physical therapy, 47, 2, pp. 114-117, (1967); Holmes, James R., Isokinetic strength characteristics of the quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles in high school students, Physical Therapy, 64, 6, pp. 914-918, (1984)","","","","","","","","","09593020","","","","English","Isokinetics Exerc.

Twenty-eight patients who each had one anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-injured knee and one normal knee participated in the study. Physical therapists-certified athletic trainers performed tests of anterior laxity on all knees using the KT-1000 knee ligament arthrometer. Patients were then tested on the Cybex at 60 and 240 deg/sec. Laxity measurements were repeated after Cybex testing. Data were analyzed by paired t-tests. Nonreconstructed ACL-injured knees showed significant laxity increases after Cybex testing for passive anterior drawer with 15 lbs of force (t = 3.218, p <.01), with 20 lbs of force (t = 2.189, p <.05), and for quadriceps active displacement (t = 2.390, p <.05). Although not statistically significant, laxity decreases were observed for reconstructed ACL-injured knees for quadriceps active displacement. The laxity of normal knees did not change significantly for any tests. The authors recommended that clinicians consistently perform KT-1000 measurements either before or after more vigorous clinical evaluations of patients with ACL injuries. The laxity increases observed among nonreconstructed ACL-injured knees may encourage therapists and athletic trainers to consider controlling anterior tibial displacement in ACL-injured patients. © 1991 Butterworth–Heinemann.","Arthrometer; Isokinetic assessment; Kt-1000; Ligamentous laxity assessment","","","","","","","","Knight, Kenneth L., Strength imbalance and knee injury, Physician and Sportsmedicine, 8, 1, (1980); Clancy, William G., Anterior cruciate ligament functional instability.

Paul, Ballard Orthopedic/Fracture Clinic, Seattle, WA, United States","We compared the results of a radiographic technique for the measurement of instability of the knee with those obtained with a KT-1000 arthrometer. The study was conducted on both knees of sixty patients who had a ruptured anterior-cruciate ligament in one knee, as well as in ten control subjects. The radiographic technique included the examination of a true lateral radiograph, made while the knee was in full extension and the quadriceps was maximally contracted, with a 66.7-newton downward force produced by a 6.8- kilogram weight suspended from the ankle. As demonstrated by both techniques, the maximum difference between the displacements of the right and left knees in the control subjects was 2.5 millimeters and the mean difference between the displacements in the two knees in the patients was 7.5 millimeters. In fourteen of the sixty knees in which the ligament was ruptured, the injury was acute. The forward translation of the medial side in these fourteen knees was compared with that in the forty-six knees in which the injury was chronic. The mean difference in the displacement of the medial side in the right and left knees was 3.5 millimeters in the fourteen patients who had an acute injury and 5.0 millimeters in the forty-six patients who had a chronic injury. Thirteen of the sixty patients had disruption of the posteromedial corner of the injured knee, and the translation of the medial side in these knees was significantly increased compared with that in the intact knees of the same patients. The radiographic technique was as accurate as the KT-1000 arthrometer in the diagnosis of unilateral rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. The quadriceps-contraction radiographic technique is an accurate and simple method for diagnosis.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; female; human; knee arthrography; knee function; knee instability; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; muscle contraction; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00219355","","JBJSA","2002074","English","J.

These injuries should be treated with immediate mobilization. Only in isolated partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears without a positive pivot shift phenomenon in conservative treatment justified. However, many of these injuries may require operative reconstruction later. In complete ACL tears the surgical treatment consists of primary reconstruction or augmented primary repair. Today, the middle third of the patella tendon with the bone blocks is regarded as the ''gold standard'' for augmented repairs and late reconstructions. For the present, there is no place for synthetic prosthesis in the treatment of an acute ACL rupture. Allograft replacement of the ACL must now be considered an experimental procedure. In the reconstruction of the PCL the above mentioned patella tendon graft is also preferable. Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) tears, especially if they are combined with ruptures of posterolateral ligament complex, should be repaired immediately after the injury. In these injuries late reconstructions are difficult and the results are poor. Conservative treatment of partial tears and postoperative treatment of reconstructed ligaments is twofold: on the one hand, the healing tissue should be protected and on the other hand, atrophy and wasting of uninjured tissue should be avoided. Overload and stretching of the injured ligaments should be eliminated with the aid of a suitable knee brace, but early range of motion exercises of the knee are allowed immediately. Thus, gradually increasing mobilization is done to avoid the deleterious effect of prolonged immobilization on cartilage, bone, muscles and tendons. The method and duration of rehabilitation following ACL injuries is controversial, but they can be more rapid and aggressive following injuries to the collateral ligaments. Many investigators have warned of potential damage to partially injured or recently repaired or reconstructed ACLs by overzealous early quadriceps exercises. Although no specific time of avoidance of quadriceps activity into full extension has been identified, it probably should be avoided for several months following repair or reconstruction of the ACL. Limited motion quadriceps activity (45° - 90°) can be performed quite early, especially if light resistance is used. Full muscle rehabilitation and return to sport and work activities must be individualized, but return to high risk activities should be discouraged following ACL surgery for over 6 months. Various techniques can be used for strengthening of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles including isometric, isotonic, isokinetic and eccentric exercises. One of the most important factors is to motivate and encourage the patient to hard and longstanding work, in a controlled fashion so as to avoid damaging healing tissues.","","article; human; knee; ligament; mobilization; sport injury; Human; Knee Injuries; Ligaments, Articular; Postoperative Care; Sprains and Strains","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03559521","","ACGYA","1897879","English","ANN.

The aim of this study was to determine if a maximum isometric quadriceps contraction significantly translates the tibia anteriorly at 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 75° of flexion. Secondly, the role of the ACL in knee stability was analyzed by comparing the amount of tibial translation in normal, ACL deficient, and reconstructed knees. Thirdly, the location in the motion arc where a quadriceps contraction produces anterior tibial translation was determined. Anterior tibial translation was measured using an arthrometer (KT-1000) during an 89 N and manual maximum translation applied to the knee at rest. The manual maximum translation test determines the magnitude of anterior tibial translation produced by a high anterior force applied directly to the proximal calf. These translations were compared to the tibial translation intrinsically induced by a quadriceps contraction. Testing was performed in normal (N = 22), ACL deficient (N = 10), and reconstructed (N = 10) knees. Anterior tibial translation produced by a maximum quadriceps contraction was measured at 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 75° of flexion. The extension exercise resulted in less anterior tibial displacement than an 89 N drawer and half the translation produced by a manual maximum translation (P < 0.001). Instrumented laxity testing produced greater anterior translation of the tibia than a maximum isometric quadriceps contraction. Anterior tibial translation was the same during maximum isometric knee extension in all tested knees. Anterior translation in the isometrically loaded knee occurred during the terminal 60° of knee extension, and was controlled by the compression forces driving the congruent articular surfaces together, and not the ACL. Instrumented laxity testing is an accepted technique that has been safely used to serially measure knee stability after an ACL reconstruction. Early postoperative knee extension exercises can be expected to induce less strain in the ACL than instrumented laxity testing. These data raise the question of whether the anterior tibial displacement produced by a maximum quadriceps contraction is detrimental to a recently reconstructed ACL.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; clinical article; conference paper; exercise; female; human; knee ligament injury; male; muscle isometric contraction; normal human; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","2285084","English","AM.

Clinical knee examination and measurements of thigh circumference, range of motion, and maximum quadriceps/hamstring strength were obtained. A detailed personal interview regarding activity level, subjective ratings, and functional status was conducted. At follow-up, anterior knee laxity was dramatically reduced, with no patients demonstrating a pivot-shift. Thigh circumference, range of motion, and maximum muscle strength were not significantly different than in the normal, uninvolved leg.

The subjective scores were tabulated for stability level, total score, and activity level.

A Hall effect strain transducer (HEST) is inserted arthroscopically into the anterior medial band (AMB) of the ACL. The strain is calculated from HEST displacement data. This method determines a reference length of the AMB when it becomes taut and load bearing. Data from HEST implantation in five patients with normal ACLs are reported. The HEST was implanted in the AMB with patients under local anesthesia. Strain was calculated during anterior-posterior shear testing and isometric quadriceps contractions at 30 and 90° of knee flexion. The results demonstrate that this technique is safe and reliable. Lachman testing (anterior shear testing at 30°) caused significantly higher strain in comparison to the drawer tests (anterior shear testing at 90°). A significant increase in strain occurred during isometric quadriceps contraction when the knee was flexed at 30°. No significant change in strain was measured, however, during isometric quadriceps contraction at 90° of flexion. These results confirm previous studies showing that the Lachman test is a more sensitive clinical method for evaluating the AMB. They suggest that isometric quadriceps activity at 90° of knee flexion can be prescribed for rehabilitation without risk of increased strain of the AMB. © 1990.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomechanics; Rehabilitation; Strain gauge","anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; clinical article; epidemiology; human; knee arthroscopy; methodology; rehabilitation; strain gauge transducer; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Human; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Contraction; Stress, Mechanical; Transducers","","","","","","","Butler, David L., Ligamentous restraints to anterior-posterior drawer in the human knee.

Each patient had a clinical examination preoperatively and under anesthesia and instrumented examination using the MedMetric KT-1000 arthrometer, Stryker knee laxity tester, and Genucom knee analysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by arthrotomy or arthroscopy. Thirty had acute knee injuries (within 2 weeks), 9 had subacute (2 weeks to 3 months), and 11 had chronic injuries. The surgical findings demonstrated that five had other maladies, but no cruciate ligament tears. Two had a partial ACL tear, and the remaining 43 patients had a least one cruciate tear. The preoperative clinical examination for cruciate ligament integrity was completely correct in 92%, correct but incomplete in 6%, and incorrect in 2%. Examination under anesthesia was correct in 98%, the KT-1000 was correct in 75% (involved knee minus noninvolved knee was ≥3 mm laxity equal to ACL tear), the Stryker was correct in 75%, and Genucom in 70%. The average laxity of those with ACL tears was 4.4 mm with the KT-1000, 4.6 mm with the Stryker, and 2.0 mm with the Genucom. The methods of testing with the Stryker and the KT-1000 are similar and the laxity recorded in patients with a torn ACL were almost identical. However, the KT-1000 can be used to identify the quadriceps neutral position and therefore more accurately determine PCL instability. The Genucom has the most versatility, but the laxity recorded in patients with a torn ACL was significantly lower that the other devices. It had the poorest correlation with the clinical Lachman test. This study suggests that clinical examination by an experienced examiner is the most accurate way to determine cruciate ligament integrity. However, instrumented testing was beneficial. In many cases, confidence in clinical diagnosis was improved by intrumented confirmation.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; clinical article; human; knee ligament injury; methodology; priority journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","2729489","English","AM.

The operation time was significantly longer with arthroscopy, but the Lysholm scores and activity levels were the same in both groups before and 1 year after the operation. There was no difference in quadriceps torque between the groups before surgery and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The measured stability in 20° of knee flexion was similar in both groups before, immediately after, and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. A slow increase in the laxity was noted. One of 20 ligaments ruptured in the arthrotomy group due to a new trauma. In the arthroscopy group, there was one rupture due to abrasion. During the follow-up, two cases in the arthroscopy group had synovitis, in one case leading to removal of the prosthesis. There seems to be no major benefit from arthroscopic reconstruction in terms of rehabilitation. The miniarthrotomy is preferred since the notch plasty is easier to perform adequately during it than during arthroscopy. © 1988, Arthroscopy Association of North America. All rights reserved.

Nineteen males and six females, mean age = 31.4 +/- 7.31 years, participated in this study. Fifteen subjects had received extraarticular and ten subjects had received intraarticular ACL reconstructions. Subjects completed a 100 point subjective functional activity questionnaire and a sports participation survey. Knee ligament stability was assessed during an objective knee examination. Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength were tested at 240 and 120 deg/sec using the Cybex II dynamometer. Anterolateral rotatory instability and positive Lachman were elicited on the operated leg for 80% of the subjects. No significant relationship was found between objective instability and the functional activity score. For the intraarticular group, a significant correlation (P less than 0.05) was found between increased quadriceps and hamstring strength on the operated leg and return to functional activities. Subjects' functional activity score was positively correlated (P less than 0.001) with their ability to participate in sports. Subjects participating in sports involving cutting and twisting motions were less successful in returning to their preinjury participation levels and reported more subjective complaints of pain, swelling, and/or instability. These results indicate that long-term progressive rehabilitation emphasizing increased quadriceps and hamstring strength to approximate the nonoperated leg may enhance successful return to functional and sports activities after ACL reconstruction.","","adult; article; female; follow up; human; joint instability; knee; ligament; male; mechanical stress; middle aged; muscle; pathophysiology; physiology; questionnaire; sport; Adult; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Ligaments, Articular; Male; Middle Aged; Muscles; Questionnaires; Sports; Stress, Mechanical; MLCS; MLOWN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","","3377102","English","Am J Sports Med","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023969540"

Postoperative immobilization was at either 30° (N = 17) or 70° (N = 12) of knee flexion for 6 weeks. All patients then followed a com mon preparatory training program for 8 weeks. In the 14th postoperative week the patients were put on either progressive resistance training (N = 12) or isokinetic training (N = 17) for 6 weeks, after which all had identical training. Independent of primary knee immobilization angle or training regimens, no differences could be demon strated with respect to stability, range of motion, func tion, or isokinetic mechanical output. For all patients, Lysholm knee function score improved from 60.5 to 93.6 (P < 0.001) and activity level from 3.9 to 6.3 (P < 0.001). Isokinetic peak torque, contractional work, and mean power of the quadriceps at 30, 90, and 180 deg/ sec were lower in the injured compared to the nonin jured leg (78% to 90%; P < 0.01) both preoperatively and at followup, and there were no significant differ ences between the preoperative and follow-up values. Clinical stability improved (P < 0.001) in 19 of the 29 patients (66%) and in 11 of those 17 patients with early isokinetic training (65%). Performance tests were nor mal in 23 of 29 patients (79%), with minor abnormalities in the rest.

Prosthetic cruciate replacement has recently become a potentially attractive alternative. The results of the Gore-Tex polytetrafluoroethylene ligament, which is intended as a permanent replacement, are reported. Eighty-two patients were followed prospectively, mean age was 28 years (range, 16 to 51 years) and mean followup was 18 months (range, 12 to 30 monts). Subjective scores improved in all categories, including pain, swelling, giving way, locking, and stair climbing. All patients without complications had no episodes of actual giving way, considered themselves improved, and returned to activities of daily living at 3 weeks and athletics at 8 months. Range of motion lacking at 3 months was 2° of extension and 10° of flexion, and at 12 months was 0° of extension and 4° of flexion. All mean objective data, including the anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift, demonstrated improvement at final followup. Cybex testing revealed improvement in relative quadriceps strength from 88% to 99%. The KT-1000 Arthrometer showed improvement in the injured-normal knee difference score throughout the follow-up period. Of importance is that while final objective data was improved over initial data, an early nonprogressive shift toward loosening was indicated by worsening of the drawer, Lachman, pivot shift, and KT-1000 scores. This shift may be attributed to resorption of interposed soft tissue, creep, or loosening of the graft. Subjective scores remained stable after improving. Complications included four ruptures, four chronic sterile effusions with partial attenuation, one infection, and one symptomatic loose body. There were 14 re-operations (17%), a total of 15 complications (18%), and 7 permanent complications (8%). There were no deaths, pulmonary emboli, or medical complications. We feel that the Gore-Tex ligament may become a rational alternative for anterior cruciate reconstruction in selected cases of prior reconstructive failure or older, less active individuals with symptomatic instability. Surgical dissection is minimal, with maintenance of autogenous tissues yielding rapid recovery and low morbidity. The results presented are based upon preliminary data, and indications for expanded use of the ligament and definitive conclusions regarding the natural history of the graft will have to await further long-term followup.","","anterior cruciate ligament; ligament prosthesis; ligament surgery; priority journal; rehabilitation; sports medicine; therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","3189652","English","AM.

We conducted a prospective study with randomized assignment of 18 patients into two groups: 9 patients in the “motion” group began 10 hours of daily continu ous passive motion (CPM) on the 2nd postoperative day, while the remaining 9 in the “delayed motion” group used a soft hinged knee brace with knee hinges locked at 10° of flexion and entered into the motion program on the 7th postoperative day. All knees were allowed full 0° to 90° of motion except for a total of seven knees with concomitant mensicus repairs and extraar ticular reconstructions where 20° to 90° of motion was allowed, limiting the last 20° of knee extension for the first 4 postoperative weeks to protect the repair. In all other respects, the rehabilitation program after surgery was the same for the two groups, including postoper ative compression dressings, exercises, and weight- bearing status. Ten of the eighteen patients had acute ACL disrup tions and 8 had chronic ACL insufficiencies. There was an even distribution of acute and chronic knee cases and of open and arthroscopic ligament procedures in the early and delayed motion groups. Associated sur gery included four meniscus repairs, three medial col lateral ligament repairs, and one lateral collateral liga ment repair. Special suturing and fixation techniques were used at surgery to maintain the integrity of liga ment and meniscus structures, allowing the surgeon to feel safe in subjecting the joint to early postoperative motion. The objective parameters measured were KT- 1000 arthrometer measurements, Cybex isokinetic testing, girth measurements at four lower limb loca tions, range of motion goniometer measurements, post operative pain medications, and days of hospitalization. Starting intermittent passive motion on the 2nd post operative day did not increase joint effusion, hemar throsis, or soft tissue swelling. In both motion groups, postoperative joint effusions were absent after the 14th postoperative day. There was no statistically significant difference in knee extension or flexion limits, pain med ication used, or hospital stay in comparing the two knee motion programs. An important finding of this study was the significant decreases in thigh circumference that occurred within the first few weeks of surgery, which progressed de spite a closely supervised inpatient and outpatient re habilitation program. The decreased thigh girth was related to the type of operative procedure. Arthroscopic reconstructions had only 25% to 38% of the loss of thigh girth found in open operative procedures. By the 7th postoperative day, the average circumference loss for the open reconstruction group (motion at 7th post operative day) was nearly 4 cm, compared with the arthroscopic group's average of 1 cm. By the 21 st postoperative day, all patients who underwent open procedures sustained an average of 6.5 cm thigh cir cumference decrease compared with a 2 to 3.5 cm loss in the arthroscopic group. We concluded that traditional rehabilitation protocols are often ineffective in prevent ing the significant quadriceps muscle atrophy that may occur within the first few days of surgery. Of importance was the finding that initiating early knee motion did not stretch out ligamentous recon structions. We strongly recommend an early motion program to decrease the morbidity of major intraarti cular ligamentous procedures. The program is initiated within the hospital setting immediately after knee sur gery. © 1987, SAGE Publications.

Clinically, all patients had at least a 1+ grade with the Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot shift tests, the majority being graded as 2+. Footswitch, high speed photography, force plate, and indwelling wire electrode data were collected while each subject performed free and fast walking, running, cutting, and stair climbing activities. During walking, single limb support times did not differ between the subject's involved and uninvolved limbs. Knee joint angles were similar between limbs during walking, running, and stair climbing maneuvers. Dynamic EMG tracings during walking demonstrated similar quadriceps and calf activity between limbs, while greater variation in hamstring firing was evident among subjects. During running, the involved limb had a longer duration of medial hamstring activity compared to the lateral hamstring. No differences were seen in either vertical or sagittal shear forces during free walking. During fast walking, higher midstance vertical forces (F2) were present in the involved limb (P < 0.05). During running, the involved limb experienced lower vertical forces (P < 0.05), while both anterior and posterior sagittal shear differences were insignificant. Straight cut maneuvers demonstrated significantly lower lateral shear and vertical forces in the involved limb (P < 0.05). Lower lateral and sagittal shear forces in the involved limb (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively), combined with a reduced angle of the cut during the cross-cut maneuver, may be the first means to assess the functional pivot shift phenomenon ever documented. Isokinetic Cybex strength testing demonstrated a mean 14% quadriceps deficit and a mean 4% hamstring deficit in the involved limb. Achieving quadriceps and hamstring torque of 86% and 96%, respectively, was not sufficient to eliminate the subjective need for surgical reconstruction.","","cutting; diagnosis; electromyography; muscle; pivot shift; priority journal; running; stair climbing; walking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","","English","AM.

At the 18-month inverval, however, the patients' functional performance seemed to be comparable in the two groups.","","anterior cruciate ligament; case report; clinical trial; conservative treatment; controlled study; diagnosis; human; injury; joint; knee injury; ligament; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; surgery; therapy; Adolescent; Adult; Arthroscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Ligaments, Articular; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Muscles; Prospective Studies; Random Allocation; Suture Techniques; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0009921X","","CORTB","3896609","English","CLIN.

All patients had their full extent of injury mapped out at arthroscopy. We believe that arthroscopy before treatment for a torn anterior cruciate ligament injury is necessary in order to treat meniscus lesions that could interfere with the rehabilitation. In this study, 26 patients were unstable with a positive pivot-shift, and 16 patients were operated on and thus stable. All patients performed a performance test with and without the brace in a randomized order. Before the start of the investigation, we postulated that patients with a quadriceps atrophy who were unstable would improve their function with the derotation brace. We could not find any effects of the brace in this study. The brace did not significantly improve function in the group of patients who were unstable with a quadriceps atrophy. On the other hand, the brace did not impair function in the patients. We conclude that to be able to improve knee function in the unstable knee, other modes of treatment than bracing are necessary. Bracing should be seen as a complement to these other treatments. © 1985, Arthroscopy Association of North America.

Surface electromyography of quadriceps and hamstrings muscles was normalized and expressed as a percentage of an isometric maximum voluntary test contraction. Working with straight knees and the trunk flexed forwards induced extending knee load moments of maximum 55 Nm. Lifting the box with flexed knees gave flexing moments of 50 Nm at the beginning of the lift, irrespective of whether the burden was between or in front of the feet. During machine milking, a level difference between operator and cow of 0.70 m - 1.0 m significantly lowered the knee extending moments. To quantify the force magnitudes acting in the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral joints, a local biomechanical model of the knee was developed using a combination of cadaver knee dissections and lateral knee radiographs of healthy subjects. the moment arm of the knee extensor was significantly shorter for women than for men, which resulted in higher knee joint forces in women if the same moment was produced. A diagram for quantifying patellar forces was worked out. the force magnitudes given by the knee joint biomechanical model correlated well with experimentally forces measured by others. During the parallel squat in powerlifting, the maximum flexing knee load moment was estimated to 335 - 550 Nm when carrying a 382.5 kg burden and the in vivo force of a complete quadriceps tendon-muscle rupture to between 10,900 and 18,300 N. During isokinetic knee extension, the tibio-femoral compressive force reached peak magnitudes of 9 times body weight and the anteroposterior shear force was close to 1 body weight at knee angles straighter than 60 degrees, indicating that high forces stress the anterior cruciate ligament. A proximal resistance pad position decreased the shear force considerably, and this position is recommended in early rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament repairs or reconstructions. the methods presented quantify muscle activity, sagittal knee joint moments and forces, enabling assessments to be made of different work postures, training exercises and joint derangements. © 1985 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","","adult; article; body posture; female; femur; human; knee; male; muscle; muscle isometric contraction; patella; physiology; radiography; tendon; tibia; Adult; Female; Femur; Human; Isometric Contraction; Knee; Knee Joint; Male; Muscles; Patella; Posture; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tendons, Para-Articular; Tibia","","","","","(79/ 1340, 84/0520); Karolinska Institutet, KI; Medicinska Forskningsrådet, MFR, (5720)","Financial support was kindly given by: The Swedish Work Environment Fund (79/ 1340, 84/0520), Alfa Laval, the Swedish Medical Research Council (5720), and the Karolinska Institute.","Ahmed, Abdul M., In-vitro measurement of static pressure distribution in synovial joints#x2014;part i: Tibial surface of the knee, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 105, 3, pp. 216-225, (1983); Ahmed, Abdul M., In-vitro measurement of static pressure distribution in synovial joints#x2014;part ii: Retropatellar surface, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 105, 3, pp. 226-236, (1983); J Hum Mov Stud, (1975); Andersson, Gunnar B.J., Quantitative studies of back loads in lifting, Spine, 1, 3, pp. 178-185, (1976); Andriacchi, Thomas P., A study of lower-limb mechanics during stair-climbing, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 62, 5, pp. 749-757, (1980); Andriacchi, Thomas P., A study of factors influencing muscle activity about the knee joint, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 1, 3, pp. 266-275, (1983); Arborelius, Ulf P., Mechanics of shoulder locomotor system during exercises resisted by weight-and-pulley-circuit, Scandinavian Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, 10, 4, pp. 171-177, (1978); Arms, Steven W., The biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation and reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 8-18, (1984); Arvidsson, Inga, Isokinetic thigh muscle strength after ligament reconstruction in the knee joint: Results from a 5-10 year follow-up after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee joint, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 1, pp. 7-11, (1981); Helv Chir Acta, (1972)","","","Informa Healthcare","","","","","","17453674","","","3865491","English","Acta Orthop.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022300435"

The data may be used to increase diag nostic and prognostic accuracy when evaluating Grade II ACL sprains and to structure properly a rehabilitation program following ACL injury. This report is based on the data from two in vivo strain gage studies of Grade II ACL sprains. Following instrumentation of the ligament, several events com mon to physical examination and rehabilitation pro grams were tested. The Lachman test produced greater elongation of the anteromedial fibers than did the anterior drawer or pivot shift test. A fairly high force of 80 pounds may be required by the examiner's hands to test satisfactorily the anteromedial fibers in the acutely injured large athlete. The proper order for a rehabilitation program should be crutch walking, cycling, walking, slow running, and faster running. Patients should be cautioned to run on a perfectly level surface. Cycling produced 7% as much elongation as an 80 pound Lachman test, and the one leg half squat 21 % as much. Quadriceps rehabilitation can be done more safely using these exercises. Quadriceps exercises by knee extension against a 20 pound weight boot in the range of full extension to 22° flexion created peak elongation of the anteromedial fibers ranging from 87 to 121% of that produced by an 80 pound Lachman test. We recommend that quadri ceps exercises and testing by knee extension through a full range of motion not be done during the first year following ACL injury or reconstruction. Quadriceps contraction against a 20 pound weight boot at 45° flexion produced 50% as much elongation as an 80 pound Lachman test. Beginning at 9 months post-ACL reconstruction, we do measure quadriceps strength isometrically with the knee flexed 45°. © 1985, SAGE Publications.

Following a variety of surgical procedures on the knee, routine clinical Cybex testing demonstrated that the hamstring muscle group loses less strength than the quadriceps group, regardless of whether the hamstrings were exercised during the rehabilitation. Two groups of post-surgical patients were randomly selected to evaluate the effects of surgery on the muscle strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings. Group I (N = 15) underwent arthrotomy and medial meniscectomy. Group II (N = 20) underwent an extraarticular substitution of the anterior cruciate ligament. All subjects were tested on a Cybex II at 60°/s: Group I at 5-10 wk (mean, 7.0), and Group II at 15-22 wk (mean, 18.6). Peak torque for the quadriceps and hamstrings was measured at 30, 60, and 90°. The percent deficits of the quadriceps and hamstrings were analyzed by a three-way ANOVA. The hamstring deficit was significantly less (P = 0.041) than the quadriceps deficit. A significant difference (P < 0.001) was found between the two surgery groups. No significant difference in percent strength deficit was found at the various joint angles (30, 60, and 90°). Lastly, the factors examined in the ANOVA did not contribute to a significant first or second order interaction. The authors conclude that specific hamstring strengthening postsurgically is not always indicated. © 1985 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","Hamstrings; Knee; Quadriceps; Rehabilitation; Strength","etiology; hamstring; human; joint; knee surgery; muscle; muscle strength; musculoskeletal system; quadriceps femoris muscle; therapy; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Human; Knee Injuries; Ligaments, Articular; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Age; Tendons, Para-Articular","","","","","","","Muschs Alive, (1974); DeAndrade, J.

In a community of athletically motivated patients, a method of strong, durable stabilization is achieved using a pedicled patellar tendon graft with a 90° twist and bone-to-bone fixation. The intercondylar notch is surgically enlarged; holes are drilled from without into the tibia and femur; the graft is harvested with bone plugs at each end, pulled into place, and transfixed with screws. Knee function is tested before closure. After operation, the emphasis is on joint ranging exercises. Quadriceps exercises are not initiated until 3 months after operation. Participation in a sport is not advised for approximately one year. The patellar tendon graft has all of the advantages of an autologous tissue, either for augmentation or substitution of the ACL. It has strength, durability, and elasticity; it can be transplanted with bone plugs; with the infrapatellar fat pad preserved, it retains its paratendinous vascularity. The method has been employed for 5 years. No graft failures have occurred, and no patient has reinjured the reconstructed ligament. Not one patient has had to give up the sport that caused the injury due to recurrent instability.","","anterior cruciate ligament; clinical article; human; injury; joint; knee cruciate ligament; ligament; patella tendon; tendon graft; therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0009921X","","CORTB","6822009","English","CLIN.

The patients were divided into four groups according to the type of operation that had been carried out. In the first group an extra-articular lateral repair (""MacIntosh tenodesis"") had been performed, in the second group an intra-articular ""over-the-top"" repair using the quadriceps and the patellar tendon, in the third group a modified ""Eriksson"" procedure using the patellar tendon, and in the fourth group a combined intra- and extra-articular repair using carbon fibres as a graft. The results of the operations in the different groups are compared. The best results were obtained with the ""Eriksson"" procedure, closely followed by the ""over-the-top"" repair. Limited range of motion and retropatellar pain resulting from changes in the alignment of the patella were the main problems. The results after the use of carbon fibres were less good. In two cases the graft tore without further trauma, and there were also problems because of restricted range of motion and retropatellar pain. The worst results were found after extra-articular lateral repair, due to insufficient stability in many cases. However, the best results with regard to the range of motion were found in this group. © 1982 J. F.
