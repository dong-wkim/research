In this retrospective study, patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with either PLT or HT grafts between 2015 and 2024 were analyzed. Postoperative follow-up data included muscle properties (tone-F, stiffness-S, elasticity-D) around the knee, International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores, and thigh circumference difference. For the PLT group, muscle properties (F, S, D) of ankle muscles (gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, tibialis anterior) and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scores were also assessed. Fifteen patients (average age 28 ± 9.83 years) were included. No significant differences were found between groups in knee muscle properties (F, S, D), International Knee Documentation Committee, or Lysholm scores (P > .05). However, thigh circumference reduction was significantly smaller in the PLT group (4.90 (4.00, 5.40)) compared to the HT group (3.45 (2.65, 4.33)) (P < .05). In the PLT group, ankle assessment revealed significant differences in elasticity (D) for the gastrocnemius and peroneus longus (P < .05) (gastrocnemius muscle: donor side [1.48 ± 0.04], healthy side [1.55 ± 0.02]; peroneus longus muscle: donor side [0.65 ± 0.27], healthy side [1.17 ± 0.03]), and in stiffness (S; donor side [391.60 ± 19.73], healthy side [433.60 ± 7.57]) and elasticity (D; donor side [1.07 ± 0.13], healthy side [1.41 ± 0.04]) for the tibialis anterior, with the healthy side showing superior values (P < .05). The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score was also significantly lower for the donor ankle side (92.20 ± 4.21) versus the healthy side (100.00 ± 0.00; P < .05). This study suggests that while both autologous PLT and HT grafts provide comparable postoperative knee function, the HT graft is associated with greater thigh muscle atrophy. The use of the PLT graft, however, leads to weakened muscle state and function around the donor ankle joint. Both grafts have distinct advantages and disadvantages, indicating that the choice should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances. © © 2026 the Author(s).

In this paper, knee joint function and walking were considered possible ones. Method: The study included 21 subjects with acute ACL tear and 20 healthy volunteers as a control group. Biomechanical gait analysis was performed using the inertial sensor system including EMG recording. All subjects (but for controls) were divided into two groups: Group 1—“up to 4 weeks” and Group 2—“from 4 weeks to 3 months”. Results: Temporal gait parameters in subjects from Group 1 demonstrate the asymmetry of 4% and more in terms of the gait cycle with a decrease in the affected limb, and are within normal range in Group 2. The amplitudes at the hip and knee joints in the affected limb are reduced which is especially pronounced in Group 1 (2–4 and 6–10 degrees, respectively). The affected knee joint shows a decrease in the range of motion by up to 5 degrees in the first half of the stance phase and flexion by less than 40 degrees in the swing phase. The tibialis anterior and quadriceps femoris muscle function is decreased in the affected limb only in Group 1 (72% and 78% from normal, respectively). Conclusions: The severity of the condition after an ACL tear is largely determined by functional changes. The time factor is of secondary importance. © 2023 by the authors.","acute form; anterior cruciate ligament tear; gait analysis; knee joint","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; biomechanics; clinical article; controlled study; disease severity; electromyography; female; gait; hip joint; human; joint function; knee joint; male; muscle function; quadriceps femoris muscle; range of motion; standing; tibialis anterior muscle; time factor; walking","","","Stadis system, Neurosoft","Neurosoft","","The study was funded as part of the government assignment to FNKC FMBA, state registration no. 20.004.21.800.","Kaeding, Christopher C., Epidemiology and Diagnosis of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 36, 1, pp. 1-8, (2017); Paudel, Yuba Raj, Increasing incidence of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a 17-year population-based study, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 31, 1, pp. 248-255, (2023); Lee, Dae-hee, Effect of time after anterior cruciate ligament tears on proprioception and postural stability, PLoS ONE, 10, 9, (2015); Manual of Arthroscopic Surgery, (2002); Cipolla, Massimo, Different patterns of meniscal tears in acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures and in chronic ACL-deficient knees - Classification, staging and timing of treatment, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 3, pp. 130-134, (1995); Shelbourne, K.

Küpper et al. (2013, 2016) and Westover et al. (2016) previously developed and reported on a magnetic resonance (MR)-based in vivo measure of knee laxity. In this study, the application of an in situ knee loading apparatus (ISKLA) is presented as a step toward validating the MR-based methodology for measuring ATT and stiffness. The ISKLA is designed to measure these outcome variables using MR imaging and is validated against a gold-standard ElectroForce mechanical test instrument (TA Instruments 3550). Accuracy was assessed through an in situ experimental setup by testing four cadaveric specimens with both the MR-based methodology and in the ElectroForce system. The outcome of the current study showed that the MR-based ATTs and stiffness measurements using the ISKLA were within 1.44–2.10 mm and 0.16–6.14 N/mm, respectively, of the corresponding values measured by the gold standard system. An excellent ICC was observed for ATT (0.97) and good ICC for stiffness (0.87) between the MR and ElectroForce-based systems across all target force levels. These findings suggest that the MR-based approach can be used with satisfactory accuracy and correlation to the gold standard measure. © 2021","Accuracy; Anterior tibial translation; Design; Knee; Magnetic resonance imaging","Magnetism; Resonance; Stiffness; Accuracy; Anterior tibial translation; Applied forces; Gold standards; In-Situ Study; In-vivo; Knee; Knee laxities; Mechanical; Tibiofemoral joint; Magnetic resonance imaging; article; controlled study; gold standard; human; knee; mechanical test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; outcome variable; validation process; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; biomechanics; cadaver; diagnostic imaging; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; tibia; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cadaver; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Range of Motion, Articular; Tibia","","","","","","","Arokoski, Jari P.A., Normal and pathological adaptations of articular cartilage to joint loading, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 10, 4, pp. 186-198, (2000); Tochigi, Yuki, Instability dependency of osteoarthritis development in a rabbit model of graded anterior cruciate ligament transection, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 93, 7, pp. 640-647, (2011); Küpper, Jessica Christine, Measuring knee joint laxity: A review of applicable models and the need for new approaches to minimize variability, Clinical Biomechanics, 22, 1, pp. 1-13, (2007); Vacek, Pamela Mary, Multivariate analysis of the risk factors for first-time noncontact ACL injury in high school and college athletes: A prospective cohort study with a nested, matched case-control analysis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 44, 6, pp. 1492-1501, (2016); Markolf, Keith L., Stiffness and laxity of the knee: the contributions of the supporting structures.

However, clinical data are still inconclusive and subjective about PRP. Thus, we propose a quantitative method to demonstrate that PRP produced morphological structure changes. METHODS: Thirty-four patients undergoing ACL reconstruction surgery were evaluated and divided into control group (sixteen patients) without PRP application and experiment group (eighteen patients) with intraoperative application of PRP. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed 3 months after surgery. We used Matlab® and machine learning (ML) in Orange Canvas® to texture analysis (TA) features extraction. Experienced radiologists delimited the regions of interest (RoIs) in the T2-weighted images. Sixty-two texture parameters were extracted, including gray-level co-occurrence matrix and gray level run length. We used the algorithms logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). RESULTS: The accuracy of the classification with NB, LR, and SGD was 83.3%, 75%, 75%, respectively. For the area under the curve, NB, LR, and SGD presented values of 91.7%, 94.4%, 75%, respectively. In clinical evaluations, the groups show similar responses in terms of improvement in pain and increase in the IKDC index (International Knee Documentation Committee) and Lysholm score indices differing only in the assessment of flexion, which presents a significant difference for the group treated with PRP. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrated quantitatively that patients who received PRP presented texture changes when compared to the control group. Thus, our findings suggest that PRP interferes with morphological parameters of the ACL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Protocol no.

Material and Method: The study included 47 patients (mean age=26.5, between 18-48 years old) who had anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. All patients were treated with arthroscopic autograft hamstring tendon, proximal fixation with the Endobutton system and a biocomposite interference screw in the tibia. Postoperatively, an accelerated improvement program was applied to all patients. The evaluation was made of the clinical and functional scores (Lysholm score and Tegner activation score) before and after the operation in all patients. Results: The mean Lysholm score was 62.4±8.6 preoperatively and 91.2±7.5 postoperatively. The mean Tegner activation score was 3.4±0.9 preoperatively and 5.4±1.2 postoperatively. According to the results of the single-leg hop test score, Lachman test, Pivot shift test and anterior drawer test, significant healing was determined in all patients. In one patient, rupture occurred because of trauma and reconstruction was applied with tibialis anterior tendon allograft.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of popliteus tendon (PT) reconstruction on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in terms of external rotation laxity and clinical outcomes with tibialis anterior allograft. Methods: Between September 2005 and December 2008, 32 consecutive patients with combined ACL and PLC injuries who underwent the combined ACL-PT reconstruction with tibialis anterior allograft were studied retrospectively. The authors randomly selected 50 patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstruction during the same operative period as the control group. Clinical outcomes were determined from data obtained before surgery and at the last follow-up examination. Result: Postoperatively, mean anterior translation (side-to-side difference) was reduced from 6.8±1.2 mm to 2.0±0.8 mm in study group and from 6.1±1.7 mm to 1.7±0.5 mm. In study group, the dial test at 30° and 90° of knee flexion had significantly decreased from 16.0°±2.3° to 4.6°±2.1° and from 12.7°±2.3° to 3.8°±2.3° at the last follow-up. These differences were statistically significant. With regard to Lysholm and Tegner activity scores, both groups showed statistically improvements at the last follow-up. The IKDC subjective knee evaluation score was 56.2±11.3 preoperatively and 86.3±10.1 postoperatively in study group and 58.6±12.3 preoperatively and 88.6±12.3 postoperatively in control group. At the last follow-up, 29 patients (90.6%) in the study group and 46 patients (92.0%) in the control group had an IKDC knee classification of A or B. Conclusions: The results of combined ACL-PT reconstruction showed as excellent as the isolated ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, the results of the medium-term study indicate that both anteroposterior and external rotation laxity could be improved by combined ACL-PT reconstruction. © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

When traveling from inside to outside and from top to bottom in the front of the knee, the patellar branch of the saphenous nerve runs parallel to the hamstring tendon. Therefore, to cut the tendon can lead to tibialis anterior skin sensitivity loss. To alter the incision direction may reduce the impact on the anterior tibial skin sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of incisions in different directions for cutting the hamstring tendon on the anterior tibial skin sensitivity in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury admitted from July 2013 to February 2014 were enrolled. These patients underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon, and randomly divided into oblique incision group (n=37) and vertical incision group (n=37). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in the incision length between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with the vertical incision group, the area of skin sensitivity loss was smaller in the oblique incision group at 2 days, 1 month and 3 months after reconstruction (P < 0.05), but after 6 months, there was no difference in the area of skin sensitivity loss and Lysholm scores between the two groups (P > 0.05). These findings indicate that during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the oblique and vertical incisions have similar effects on had no effect on postoperative recovery of anterior tibial skin sensitivity and knee function. © 2014, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Repair of the ACL often requires the use of autografts or allografts, and the RN first assistant (RNFA) often is the team member responsible for preparing the graft. Common grafts used in ACL repair include bone-patellar tendon-bone, hamstring, Achilles tendon, quadriceps tendon, and tibialis anterior tendon. The RNFA must be competent in preparing all of these grafts and in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using each graft, such as the reasons for graft choice, and must ensure that all graft-related supplies and equipment are available and ready for use. The ability to prepare all graft types expands treatment options, reduces surgical time, and enhances the role of the RNFA. © 2014 AORN, Inc.","ACL; ACL reconstruction; Allograft; Anterior cruciate ligament; Autograft; RN first assistant; RNFA","anterior cruciate ligament; human; injuries; orthopedic surgery; perioperative nursing; surgery; transplantation; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Humans; Orthopedic Procedures; Perioperative Nursing","","","","","","","Aaos Now, (2007); Bourke, Henry E., Survival of the anterior cruciate ligament graft and the contralateral ACL at a minimum of 15 years, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, 9, pp. 1985-1992, (2012); AORN Position Statement on RN First Assistants, (2014); Assisting in Surgery Patient Centered Care, (2009); Alexander S Care of the Patient in Surgery, (2011); Unwin, Andrew, (iii) What's new in anterior cruciate ligament surgery?, Orthopaedics and Trauma, 24, 2, pp. 100-106, (2010); undefined, (2014); Acl Surgery how to Get It Right the First Time and What to do if Itfails, (2010); Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment, (2006); Dempsey, Alasdair R., Changing sidestep cutting technique reduces knee valgus loading, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 37, 11, pp. 2194-2200, (2009)","","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00012092","","","25443120","English","AORN J.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908150663"

Sixteen medium-level active chronic ACL-deficient patients classified as ""copers"" (injury duration: 12-240 months, age 17-52 years) and 15 healthy subjects (age 20-33 years) walked at self-selected speed along a 10-m runway with a level force-plate. Gait specific data, ground reaction forces, knee and ankle angles, and EMG were documented. Knee laxity was increased and the functional scores (Lysholm, KOOS) decreased in the ACL-deficient subjects, whereas the Tegner activity level score was normal. Gait speed, stride length and stance time did not differ between ACL-deficient subjects and controls. Ground reaction forces (magnitude and times), as well as knee and ankle angles at selected points during stance and swing phases were normal in the ACL-deficient subjects compared to controls. The total duration of m. tibialis anterior (TA) activity was longer in ACL-deficient subjects than in controls (ACL-deficient injured leg vs. controls, P < 0.05). In addition, the onset of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle activity occurred earlier in ACL-deficient patients (P < 0.03), resulting in a TA-LG cocontraction in the ACL-deficient but not in the control group. In conclusion, chronic, medium-level active ACL-deficient patients showed abnormalities in muscular activity patterns during gait compared to control subjects, whereas there were no detectable changes in ground reaction forces and 3D kinematic data. As the aberrant muscular activity pattern may be of importance for an even gait, it is proposed that EMG recordings may give additional information in the evaluation and rehabilitation of gait when the ACL is absent. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","ACL; EMG; Forces; Gait analysis; Rehabilitation","","","","","","Karolinska Institutet, KI","Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

However, it is not known how the other ankle muscles that do not cross the knee are affected. We focused on the two muscles that control the ankle, the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles, to see how they were affected by an ACL injury. We hypothesized that the ankle muscles of subjects with ACL injuries that did not require surgery (copers) would be more like normals and that the muscles of subjects with ACL injuries who required surgery to return to normal activity (noncopers) would atrophy. Methods: Twenty-seven subjects were divided into three even categories: unimpaired subjects, copers, and noncopers. Axial spin-echo T1-weighted MRI images were used to digitally reconstruct the tibialis anterior and the soleus. We used the digitally reconstructed muscles to determine the peak cross-sectional area and volume of each muscle. Results: The copers' tibialis anterior muscles were similar to the unimpaired subjects, but, surprisingly, the noncoper's tibialis anterior muscles of the injured leg were larger than those of their uninjured legs (P < 0.05). In the soleus, the results showed a trend of not being affected. Conclusion: The increase in size of the tibialis anterior in noncopers may have been caused by altered gait patterns in noncopers. We believe this is due to either an ankle-stiffening strategy during heel strike or from the inversion of the foot causing external rotation of the tibia as a stabilizing technique for the knee.
