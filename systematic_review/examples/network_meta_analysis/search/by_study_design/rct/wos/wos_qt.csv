A Prospective Randomized Study,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose: The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to compare knee stability, kneeling pain, harvest site pain, sensitivity loss, and subjective clinical outcome after primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with either bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or quadriceps tendon-bone (QTB) autografts in a noninferiority study design. Methods: From 2005 to 2009, a total of 51 patients were included in the present study. Inclusion criteria were isolated ACL injuries in adults. Twenty-five patients were randomized to BPTB grafts and 26 to QTB grafts. An independent examiner performed follow-up evaluations 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Anteroposterior knee laxity was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA). Anterior knee pain was assessed clinically and by knee-walking ability. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were used for patient-evaluated outcome. Results: Anterior knee laxity was equal between the 2 groups with KT-1000 values of 1.1 +/- 1.4 mm and 0.8 +/- 1.7 mm standard deviation (SD) at follow-up in QTB and BPTB groups, respectively (P.65), whereas positive pivot shift test results were seen less frequently (14% compared with 38%, respectively; P = .03). Anterior kneeling pain, evaluated by the knee walking ability test, was significantly less in the QTB group, with only 7% of patients grading knee walking as difficult or impossible compared with 34% in the BPTB group. At 1 and 2 years' follow-up, there was no difference between the 2 groups in subjective patient-evaluated outcome. The IKDC score was 75 +/- 13 patients and 76 +/- 16 SD at 1-year follow-up in QTB and BPTB groups, respectively (P = .78). At 2 years, 12 patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in 18 in the BPTB group and 21 in the QTB group. Conclusions: The use of the QTB graft results in less kneeling pain, graft site pain, and sensitivity loss than seen with BPTB grafts; however, similar anterior knee stability and subjective outcomes are seen. The results of this study show that QTB is a viable option for ACL reconstruction.

The use of the CaP hybridization method for quadriceps tendon-bone (QTB) graft in ACL reconstruction has not been reported in previous studies. Thus, this clinical trial aimed to clarify the safety and feasibility of using CaP hybridization method for quadriceps tendon-bone (QTB) graft in ACL reconstruction. Methods: Eight patients (average age, 41.6 +/- 10.6 years; 2 men and 6 women) with unilateral ACL injury were included in this study. They underwent ACL reconstruction using QTB graft that hybridized CaP. The follow-up period was from 2 months to 4 years (average, 2.4 +/- 1.5 years). Cases of adverse events, including tumor formation, infection, fracture, contracture, severe pain, and re-rupture, were recorded. Moreover, clinical results (KT-1000 arthrometry, pivot-shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee grade, Lysholm scale, and sports activity level), and images of graft and bone tunnel (magnetic resonance imaging, arthroscopic appearance, and computed tomography) were also evaluated. Results: No adverse events were observed in the follow-up periods. Postoperative clinical results showed improvement compared with the preoperative findings. The sports activity level after the surgery became equivalent to that before injury. There was no progression of bone tunnel enlargement. Conclusions: Using the CaP hybridization method for QTB graft in ACL reconstruction was safe and feasible in the clinical trial. Moreover, this method may improve clinical outcomes. In the future, it is necessary to verify the effect of the CaP hybridization method for QTB graft in ACL reconstruction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP-OCT,2019,16,5,,,,,422,425,,10.1016/j.jor.2019.04.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jor.2019.04.004,,,,,,,,31193021,,,,,WOS:000489090200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

It was hypothesized that anatomic DB ACLR would result in better International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) scores and reduced anterior and rotatory laxity compared to SB ACLR. Methods Active individuals between 14 and 50 years of age that presented within 12 months of injury were eligible to participate. Individuals with prior injury or surgery of either knee, greater than a grade 1 concomitant knee ligament injury, or ACL insertion sites less than 14 mm or greater than 18 mm were excluded.

The primary outcome measures included the IKDC-SKF and KT-1000 (side to side difference) and pivot shift tests. Other secondary outcomes included measures of sports activity and participation, range of motion (ROM) and re-injury. Results Enrollment in the study was suspended due to patellar fractures related to harvest of the patellar bone plug.

Limited evidence is available regarding the most effective intervention to achieve symmetry after reconstruction with contralateral bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft. Purpose: To verify whether unilateral isotonic resistance exercise is more effective than bilateral exercise for obtaining postoperative functional and muscular strength symmetry between the donor limb and reconstructed limb for patients who received BPTB graft. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 88 patients were randomly divided into a control group (n = 44) and an intervention group (n = 44). All participants performed an 8-week exercise program starting at the beginning of the fourth postoperative month and were evaluated before and after the program. The control group performed bilateral exercises, and the intervention group performed unilateral exercises for the donor limb only (the limb with the greatest disability). The primary outcome was muscle strength (peak torque and hamstrings to quadriceps [H:Q] ratio), and the secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM; goniometry), KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference in anteroposterior knee laxity, and objective (single-leg hop test) and subjective (Lysholm score) functionality. Results: Both groups improved significantly from before to after the exercise program. The improvements were significantly greater in the intervention group regarding peak torque, H:Q ratio, flexion ROM, single-leg hop test, and Lysholm score in the donor limb (P < .001 for all), and the improvements were significantly greater in the control group regarding peak torque and single-leg hop test in the reconstructed limb (P < .001 for both). Comparison between the groups showed significantly increased symmetry regarding peak torque, H:Q ratio, and single-leg hop test in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .001), with large effect sizes (>0.80) except for the H:Q ratio. Conclusion: Although postoperative, bilateral, isotonic resistance exercise provided better strength gains to the reconstructed limb, unilateral exercise was more effective in obtaining functional and muscle strength between-limb symmetry in patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with contralateral BPTB graft.

Methods: A total of 56 participants were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and placed into two groups: HT or QT. The hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio was the primary end-point measured with a Genu-3 dynamometer. Peak torque, functional assessment (Lysholm knee scoring scale and Cincinnati Knee Rating System), and anteroposterior laxity (KT-20001m arthrometer) were also assessed. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: The results of the H/Q ratio analysis of the participants over time revealed significant differences at 60, 180, and 300 degrees/s at three, six, and 12 months of follow-up (60 degrees/s: F = 5.3, p = 0.005; 180 degrees/s: F = 5.5, p = 0.004; 300 degrees/s: F = 5.1, p = 0.005). Furthermore, they revealed significant differences at 60 degrees/s, 180 degrees/s, and 300 degrees/s in the participants over time for peak torque in the extensor muscle strength at three and six months of follow-up, with higher values in the hamstring tendon group but not at 12 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences in functional endpoints or arthrometer assessments at 24 months of follow-up. Conclusion: An ACLR with a QT graft showed similar functional results with a better isokinetic H/Q ratio compared to an ACLR with the HT at 12 months of follow-up in soccer players. This higher H/Q ratio observed with the QT could be an advantage of this graft over the HT for an ACLR. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose:To evaluate the timing and rate of return for knee range of motion (ROM), stability, strength, and subjective scores after ACL reconstruction with contralateral patellar tendon graft (PTG). Study Design:Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods:Included were 2148 patients (1238 male patients, 910 female patients) who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with a contralateral PTG between 1995 and 2017 and had complete objective data through 3 months of follow-up. All patients participated in a rehabilitation program specific to goals for each knee. Patients were evaluated objectively with goniometric measurement of ROM, isokinetic quadriceps strength testing, and laxity with a KT-2000 arthrometer. Subjective data were collected at 2 and 5 years. Results:Normal extension on the reconstructed knee was attained for 95% of patients at 1 week postoperatively; normal flexion on the reconstructed knee was reached by 77% of patients by 3 months. At 3 months postoperatively, mean limb symmetry index strength was 104%, and the strength on the ACL-reconstructed and graft-donor knees was 87% and 86% of their respective preoperative strength. Mean manual maximum side-to-side difference in laxity was 2.0 mm at 1 month. Most patients (90%) returned to level 8 sports or higher and did so at an average of 5.7 months. Mean International Knee Documentation Committee scores for the ACL-reconstructed and graft-donor knees were 89 and 91 at 2 years (n = 1015 patients) and 84 and 90 at 5 years (n = 1275 patients), respectively. Mean Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale scores for the ACL-reconstructed and graft-donor knees were 92 and 96 at 2 years (n = 1184) and 88 and 94 at 5 years (n = 1236), respectively.

There was a 2-year minimum follow-up. From January to December 2009, an ACL 4-tunnel, anatomic, double-bundle reconstruction was performed on 27 patients. Double-strand hamstring tendon grafts were used in each femoral tunnel as well as two interference screws. Tibial fixation was insured through manual tension, by tying non-absorbable sutures on the bone bridge between the two tunnels at 20A degrees of knee flexion. Clinical assessments included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm knee scores, range of motion (ROM), pivot-shift test, single-leg hop, and quadriceps-hamstrings strength tests using a hand-held dynamometer. Anterior knee laxity was also assessed using a rolimeter. A single examiner performed all testing pre-operatively at 6 months and during the 2-year follow-up. All patients were assessed during the 2-year follow-up. At that time, 92 % of the patients presented normal anterior laxity (average, 1.3 +/- 0.5 mm) and rotational knee stability. No statistical side-to-side difference was found for ROM, muscle strength, single-leg hop, and function (n.s.). All patients presented a normal knee function according to the IKDC and the Lysholm score. In addition, no infection, graft failure, or pain were observed at the harvesting site.

Additionally, patients in group I received the HA commencing at 4 weeks after surgery, patients in group II at 8 weeks, and patients in group III at 12 weeks. Patients in group IV did not receive HA but did receive the same volume of normal saline as control subjects at 4 weeks after surgery. The rehabilitation program started at the same time after surgery for all groups. Main Outcome Measurements: Outcomes were measured at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after reconstruction, and at follow-up I year later. These included the changes in Lysholm, knee scoring scale, knee range of motion, ambulation speed (AS), and muscle peak torque (MPT) of knee flexion and extension. Results: There were improvements in groups I-III shortly after receiving the HA, but not in the saline group (group IV). Patients in groups II and III showed more improvement in AS and MPT after rehabilitation program and at follow-up. Besides, the best results I year later occurred in the group receiving HA at 8 weeks after surgery (group II). Conclusion: HA therapy results in more functional and MPT improvement in ACL rehabilitation, and the intervention at 8 weeks after surgery results in the best outcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2007,17,4,,,,,242,250,,10.1097/JSM.0b013e31812570fa,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JSM.0b013e31812570fa,,,,,,,,17620776,,,,,WOS:000247948500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Five-Year Results of a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: High-level evidence for short-term outcomes of contemporary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) suture repair (ACLSR) in comparison with those of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is scarce. High-level evidence for mid- and long-term results is lacking, whereas outcomes of ACLSR in several historical studies were shown to deteriorate at midterm follow-up after initial good short-term outcomes. Hypothesis: Contemporary ACLSR is noninferior to ACLR in the treatment of acute ACL rupture in terms of patient self-reported outcomes at 5 years postoperatively. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 48 patients were enrolled in the study and, after stratification and randomization, underwent either dynamic augmented (DA) ACLSR or anatomic single-bundle ACLR. The primary outcome measure was the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 (IKDC) subjective score (IKDCs). Furthermore, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner Activity Scale score (TAS), visual analog scale score for satisfaction (VASs), IKDC physical examination score (IKDCpe), limb symmetry index for quadriceps (LSIq) and hamstrings (LSIh) strength and jump test battery (LSIj), Kellgren-Lawrence grade of osteoarthritis (OA), and rate of adverse events were recorded. Analyses were based on an intention-to-treat principle. Results: The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the median IKDCs of the DA ACLSR group (n = 23; 75.9) was lower than the prespecified noninferiority margin (n = 21; 86.6). Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. However, the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the DA ACLSR group (100.0) was higher than the median IKDCs of the ACLR group (96.6), rendering the result for noninferiority inconclusive. No statistical difference was found between groups for median IKDCs (repair, 90.2; reconstruction, 96.6). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were found for any of the secondary outcome measures for the DA ACLSR compared with the ACLR group: KOOS Symptoms, 92.9 versus 96.4; KOOS Pain, 100 versus 97.2; KOOS Activities of Daily Living, 100 versus 100; KOOS Sport and Recreation, 85.0 versus 100; TAS score, 7.0 versus 6.5; VASs, 9.2 versus 8.7; IKDCpe, 81.8% versus 100%; LSIq, >= 91.6 versus >= 88.2; LSIh, >= 95.1 versus >= 90.7; LSIj, >= 94.2 versus >= 97.6; OA grade 0, 90.9% versus 77.8%; clinical ACL failure rate, 20.8% versus 27.2%; and repeat surgery rate, 37.5% versus 20.0%, respectively. Conclusion: It remains inconclusive whether the effectiveness of DA ACLSR is noninferior to that of ACLR in terms of subjective patient-reported outcomes as measured using the IKDCs. Although DA ACLSR may be a viable treatment option for patients with acute ACL rupture, caution must be exercised when considering this treatment for young, active patients, corresponding to the present study population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,50,7,,,,,1779,1787,3.63547E+15,10.1177/03635465221090527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03635465221090527,,APR 2022,,,,,,35486517,,,,,WOS:000789157400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Graft choice has shown to have an influence on postoperative outcomes after ACL-R. While patient reported outcomes measurements do not differ between graft options, evidence shows that normal knee kinematics is not fully restored after ACL-R with an increase in postoperative anterior tibial translation (ATT). Postoperative graft rupture rates seem to favor bone-patella-tendon-bone (BPTB) and quadriceps tendon (QT) autografts over HT or allografts. While return to sports rates seem comparable between different graft types, postoperative extensor strength is reduced in patients with BPTB and QT whereas flexion strength is weakened in patients with HT.

Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted with 90 male patients undergoing primary unilateral ACLR, randomly assigned to either a prehabilitation group (45 patients) or a non-preoperative rehabilitation group (45 patients). The prehabilitation group participated in an 8-week programme including neuromuscular training, strength exercises and education; another group received a home-based exercise programme for 8 weeks, while both groups received identical post-operative rehabilitation. Primary outcomes were measured using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 12 months, with secondary outcomes including pain levels assessed by the visual analogue scale, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, functional performance tests and structural assessments through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Statistical analyses included repeated-measures analysis of variance, multiple linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: At 12-month follow-up, the prehabilitation group demonstrated significantly better outcomes compared to the non-preoperative group: IKDC scores improved by 11.3 points (92.4 vs. 77.1), pain scores were lower (0.0 vs. 1.0) and thigh muscle asymmetry was reduced (0.8 cm vs. 1.5 cm). MRI results also showed better structural healing in the preoperative rehabilitation group. The programme was identified as the strongest predictor of improved knee function and reduced recovery time by 2.6 weeks (7.2 weeks vs. 9.8 weeks). Conclusions: Preoperative rehabilitation is essential for better recovery after ACLR. These findings support incorporating preoperative rehabilitation into standard treatment protocols. Further research should investigate these effects in broader patient populations and examine underlying biological mechanisms.

Methods: Thirty male patients (mean age: 28.1 years) with ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) an experimental group to receive a KT treatment through the muscle and lymphatic correction techniques; or (2) a control group for sham KT. Both interventions were applied twice during a 10-day period from the fourth postoperative day. All patients received the same rehabilitation program for three months. The groups were compared according to range of motion (ROM), pain, swelling and muscle strength before treatment and on the fifth and tenth treatment days. Subjective evaluations were made with the Lysholm, modified Cincinnati and Tegner scores on the first and third postoperative months. Results: Intragroup comparisons showed significant improvements in both groups on the fifth and tenth day and first and third month evaluations (p < 0.05).

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is a treatment that can counteract strength loss and serve as an adjunct to conventional therapy. Purpose: To compare the effect of adding traditional neuromuscular electrical stimulation (Polystim) or a novel garment-integrated neuromuscular electrical stimulation (Kneehab) to a standard postoperative rehabilitation program (control). Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Ninety-six patients, of a total enrolled cohort of 131 patients randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups, completed a standard rehabilitation program. In addition, the 2 neuromuscular electrical stimulation groups underwent 20-minute sessions of neuromuscular electrical stimulation 3 times a day, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks, in which stimulation was superimposed on isometric volitional contractions. Outcome measures including isokinetic strength of the knee extensors of the injured and uninjured leg at 90 and 180 deg/s, along with functional tests of proprioception, were assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months postoperatively. Results: The Kneehab group achieved significantly better results at each time point compared with the Polystim and control groups (P<.001). Extensor strength of the Kneehab group at speeds of 90 and 180 deg/s increased by 30.2% and 27.8%, respectively, between the preoperative measurements and the 6-month follow-up point in the injured leg. The corresponding changes for Polystim were 5.1% and 5%, whereas for the control group they were 6.6% and 6.7%, respectively. The mean single-legged hop test hop score of the Kneehab group improved by 50% between the 6-week and 6-month follow-up, whereas the corresponding changes for the Polystim and control groups were 26.3% and 26.2%, respectively. Although there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the Tegner score and the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 knee examination score, the Kneehab group showed a significant difference in mean improvement for the baseline corrected Lysholm score compared with the control group (P =.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-8.59) and with the Polystim group (P<.001; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-9.09) with no significant difference evident between Polystim and control groups (P =.97; 95% confidence interval, -4.23 to 3.51).

Psychological and physiological factors may negatively affect patient recovery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), and development of kinesiophobia is possible. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of kinesiophobia and lower-leg muscle strength recovery in both sexes after ACLR. Methods: 140 ACLR patients agreed to participate in the study. Kinesiophobia was assessed using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK). The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) were used for patient-related outcome measurements. In both legs quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength at 60 degrees/s degrees /s and 180 degrees/s degrees /s were measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. For dynamic balance and leg function, the Y-balance test and single-leg hop test were used. Results: 100 (71%) males and 40 (29%) females-mean age 32.5 (+8.3)-were examined 5.5 (+1.25) years after ACLR. 68/140 patients (48.6%) reported a TSK kinesiophobia score equal to or higher than 37 points: 54/100 (54%) males and 14/40 (35%) females (p = 0.04). Patients with kinesiophobia had significantly lower KOOS values (p < 0.001). In terms of the TAS no significant differences were found between those with or without kinesiophobia. Knee strength deficiency at 180 degrees/sec degrees /sec and 60 degrees/sec degrees /sec was significantly higher in the kinesiophobia group in knee extension in males (p = 0.009) and knee flexion in females (p = 0.001). Normalized body weight isokinetic average peak torque strength tests were significantly better in males compared to females in both groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Both sexes reported high rates of kinesiophobia, but males are at higher risk of developing kinesiophobia than females in the medium term after ACLR. Furthermore, patients with kinesiophobia have significantly lower total KOOS scores, and females were significantly weaker than males in knee flexion and extension according to normalized body weight muscle strength tests. Also, a longer time from injury to surgery increases the risk of kinesiophobia in females. Level of evidence: Level IV. Type of study: Retrospective case series study.

A randomized controlled study,CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: The achievement of an optimal return to sport (RTS) has remained a key goal after sports-related injuries, with the ongoing debate on the effectiveness of different surgical approaches for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. This study aims to assess clinical outcomes and RTS across various surgical methods, such as anatomical single-bundle reconstruction (ASBR), central-axial single-bundle reconstruction (CASBR), and double-bundle reconstruction (DBR). Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted, comprising 191 patients who underwent ACL rupture. These patients were divided into three groups based on the ACL reconstruction techniques they received (ASBR, CASBR, DBR). Over the 2-year follow-up period, the study assessed RTS through four single-hop tests, isokinetic extension tests, and limb asymmetry indices. Postoperative graft status was determined using the signal-to-noise quotient (SNQ), while knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 (IKDC-2000) score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, and degree of knee laxity. A binary logistic regression model was developed to forecast the factors influencing ideal RTS. Results: DBR (67.63%) and CASBR (58.00%) exhibited higher RTS passing rates compared to ASBR (30.39%; chi(2)= 19.57, P <0.05). Quadriceps strength symmetry in the lower limbs was identified as the key determinant of RTS (chi(2) = 17.08, P <0.05). The RTS rate was influenced by SNQs of the graft's tibial site (odds ratio: 0.544) and quadriceps strength of the reconstructed knee joint at 60 degrees/s (odds ratio: 6.346). Notably, the DBR group showed enhanced knee stability, evidenced by superior results in the Lachman test (chi(2)= 13.49, P <0.01), objective IKDC-2000 (chi(2)= 27.02, P = 0.002), and anterior instability test (chi(2)= 9.46, P <0.01). Furthermore, DBR demonstrated superior clinical outcomes based on the Lysholm score (DBR: 89.57 +/- 7.72, CASBR: 83.00 +/- 12.71, ASBR: 83.21 +/- 11.95; F = 10.452, P <0.01) and IKDC-2000 score (DBR: 90.95 +/- 7.00, CASBR: 84.64 +/- 12.68, ASBR: 83.63 +/- 11.41; F = 11.78, P <0.01). Conclusion: For patients with ACL rupture, more ideal RTS rate and clinical outcomes were shown in the DBR group than in the ASBR and CASBR groups.

Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial from 2018 to 2019. The same preoperative protocol, surgical technique and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. Eighty-eight young adult male patients were randomized, and 44 of each group completed the trial. Results: After the follow up analysis, the contralateral receptor and donor limb demonstrated a statistically significant increase in peak extension torque compared with the ipsilateral operated limb (effect size (ES) = 0.99, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001; ES = 0.46, power = 0.56, P < 0.04). The symmetry between limbs was compared between groups. In the contralateral group, there was a significant decrease in the recipient limb (after surgery), compared with the donor limb (before surgery) (ES = 0.87, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001). In the ipsilateral group, the operated limb demonstrated a significant decrease in peak extension torque compared with the non-operated limb after surgery (ES = 1.88, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001). The comparison between groups in sensory-motor capacity and Lysholm score demonstrated a non-significant group effect postoperatively. Conclusion: The use of contralateral BPTB is more effective in increasing peak extension torque when compared with ipsilateral technique in young sportsmen.

Our aim was to investigate the effects of quadriceps tendon autograft (QTB) vs. semitendinosus-gracilis autograft (StG) on thigh muscle strength and functional capacity, and a patient-reported outcome 1 year after ACL-R, and to compare the results to healthy controls. Methods ACL-R patients (n = 100) and matched controls (CON, n = 50) were recruited, with patients being randomly assigned to QTB (n = 50) or StG (n = 50) ACL-R. One year after ACL-R, bilateral knee extensor (KE) and flexor (KF) muscle strength (isometric, dynamic, explosive, limb symmetry index [LSI], hamstring:quadriceps ratio [HQ ratio]) were assessed by isokinetic dynamometry, along with functional capacity (single leg hop distance [SHD]) and a patient-reported outcome (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] score). Results KE muscle strength of the operated leg was lower (9-11%) in QTB vs. StG as was KE LSI, while KF muscle strength was lower (12-17%) in StG vs. QTB as was KF LSI. HQ ratios were lower in StG vs. QTB. Compared with the controls, KE and KF muscle strength were lower in StG (10-22%), while KE muscle strength only was lower in QTB (16-25%). Muscle strength in the StG, QTB, and CON groups was identical in the non-operated leg. While SHD and IKDC did not differ between StG and QTB, SHD in both StG and QTB was lower than CON. The IKDC scores improved significantly 1 year following ACL-R for both graft types. Conclusion One year after ACL-R, muscle strength is affected by autograft type, with StG leading to impairments of KE and KF muscle strength, while QTB results in more pronounced impairments of KE only.

Methods: A total of 100 participants between 16 and 50 years of age with a complete ACL tear were randomly assigned to undergo ACLR using either the ipsilateral or contralateral leg as the STG graft donor. Primary outcome measures were the ACL Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QOL), concentric knee flexion and extension strength at 60 and 240 deg/s, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, early postoperative pain and diary of analgesic use, and rate of reruptures. Outcome measures were evaluated before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Results: The ACL-QOL score improved over time for both groups (P < .001), and there were no significant differences between groups at any time point (P = .528). Significant differences in knee flexion and extension strength were found at 3 months after surgery. There were no differences between groups in IKDC knee assessment scores or rerupture rates. Conclusion: There does not appear to be any measurable benefit or drawback in quality of life to the use of an STG graft from the unaffected limb. In light of this finding, further research to examine other possible effects on agility and balance as well as time and ability to return to sport should be conducted. Longer term follow-up beyond 2 years would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the risk of reruptures or contralateral reruptures using this novel approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2013,41,11,,,,,2492,2499,,10.1177/0363546513499140,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546513499140,,,,,,,,24001575,,,,,WOS:000326453500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Elastic knee sleeves may be useful adjuncts to rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to determine the immediate and 6-week effects of wearing a knee sleeve on person-reported outcomes and function in participants who had undergone an ACL reconstruction and who had residual self-reported functional limitations. Methods: Individuals with ACL reconstruction in the previous 6 months to 5 years were recruited. Immediate effects of a commercially-available elastic knee sleeve on single-leg horizontal hop distance were explored using a cross-over design. Following this first session, participants were randomised into a Control Group and a Sleeve Group who wore the sleeve for 6 weeks, at least 1 h daily. Outcome measures for the randomised clinical trial (RCT) were the International Knee Documentation Classification Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) score, the single-leg horizontal hop distance, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring peak torque. Linear mixed models were used to determine random effects. Where both limbs were measured at multiple time points, a random measurement occasion effect nested within participant was used. Results: Thirty-four individuals (16 women) with ACL reconstruction completed the cross-over trial. Hop distance for the injured side during the sleeve condition increased by 3.6 % (95 % CI 0.4-6.8 %, p = 0.025). There was no evidence of differential changes between groups for the IKDC-SKF (Sleeve Group n = 15; Control Group n = 16; p = 0.327), or relative improvement in the injured side compared to the uninjured side for the physical performance measures (Sleeve Group n = 12, Control Group n = 12; three-way interaction p = 0.533 [hop distance], 0.381 [quadriceps isokinetic peak torque], and 0.592 [hamstring isokinetic peak torque]).

The patients were randomly divided into three groups when they reached four weeks post surgery: (1) concentric CE (n=16); (2) eccentric CE (n=16); and (3) control (n=16). All groups followed the same post-surgical rehabilitation program for their reconstructed limb. Additionally, the two experimental groups followed eight weeks of isokinetic training for the uninjured knee at 60 degrees/s for 3 days per week.

The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the effect of a combined, progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise intervention on knee muscle strength, functional capacity and hamstring muscle-tendon morphology in ACL-reconstructed patients with persistent hamstring muscle-strength deficiency compared with controls. Methods/design:The study is designed as a multicenter, parallel-group RCT with balanced randomization (1:1) and blinded outcome assessments (level of evidence:II) and will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT Statement. Fifty ACL-reconstructed patients (hamstring auto-graft) with persistent limb-to-limb knee-flexor muscle-strength asymmetry at 12-24 months' post surgery, will be recruited through outpatient clinics and advertisements. Patients will be randomized to a 12-week progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise group (SNG) with supervised training twice weekly or a control intervention (CON) consisting of a home-based, low-intensity exercise program. Outcome measures include between-group change in maximal isometric knee-flexor strength (primary outcome) and knee-extensor muscle strength, hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratios of the leg that has been operated on and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (secondary outcomes). In addition, several explorative outcomes will be investigated:The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), the Tegner Activity Score, rate of force development (RFD) for the knee flexors and extensors, tendon regeneration and potential muscle hypertrophy at graft harvest site evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postural control, kinetic/kinematic gait characteristics and knee-related functional capacity. Discussion:This RCT is designed to investigate the effect of combined, progressive-resistance and neuromuscular exercises on knee-flexor/extensor strength, in the late rehabilitation phase following ACL reconstruction. Reduced hamstring strength represents a potential risk factor for secondary ACL rupture and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis.

However, clinical outcomes have not been examined, and high loads on the lower extremity could be detrimental to knee articular cartilage. Purpose: To compare the immediate effect of low- and high-intensity plyometric exercise during rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction on knee function, articular cartilage metabolism, and other clinically relevant measures. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Twenty-four patients who underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction (mean, 14.3 weeks after surgery; range, 12.1-17.7 weeks) were assigned to 8 weeks (16 visits) of low- or high-intensity plyometric exercise consisting of running, jumping, and agility activities. Groups were distinguished by the expected magnitude of vertical ground-reaction forces. Testing was conducted before and after the intervention. Primary outcomes were self-reported knee function (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] subjective knee form) and a biomarker of articular cartilage degradation (urine concentrations of crosslinked C-telopeptide fragments of type II collagen [uCTX-II]). Secondary outcomes included additional biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism (urinary concentrations of the neoepitope of type II collagen cleavage at the C-terminal three-quarter-length fragment [uC2C], serum concentrations of the C-terminal propeptide of newly formed type II collagen [sCPII]) and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-), functional performance (maximal vertical jump and single-legged hop), knee impairments (anterior knee laxity, average knee pain intensity, normalized quadriceps strength, quadriceps symmetry index), and psychosocial status (kinesiophobia, knee activity self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing). The change in each measure was compared between groups. Values before and after the intervention were compared with the groups combined. Results: The groups did not significantly differ in the change of any primary or secondary outcome measure. Of interest, sCPII concentrations tended to change in opposite directions (mean SD: low-intensity group, 28.7 185.5 ng/mL; high-intensity group, -200.6 +/- 255.0 ng/mL; P = .097; Cohen d = 1.03). Across groups, significant changes after the intervention were increased the IKDC score, vertical jump height, normalized quadriceps strength, quadriceps symmetry index, and knee activity self-efficacy and decreased average knee pain intensity. Conclusion: No significant differences were detected between the low- and high-intensity plyometric exercise groups.

Whole-body vibration (WBV), which can modulate quadriceps neuromuscular function has not yet been incorporated into ACL prehabilitation.

Forty-four participants with a primary, unilateral ACL rupture were randomly assigned to the control (N = 22) or the WBV group (N = 22). The control group underwent prehabilitation twice weekly for five weeks. The WBV group received the same prehabilitation plus WBV. Quadriceps neuromuscular function, including strength (maximal voluntary isometric contraction, MVIC), the early (rate of torque development from 0 to 50ms, RTD0 - 50), and the late phase (rate of torque development from 100 to 200ms, RTD100 - 200) of rapid contraction and inhibition (central activation ratio, CAR) in the injured limb, were measured at baseline and preoperatively. Knee function was assessed by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score at baseline, preoperatively, and 4 months postoperatively. The linear mixed effect models and multiple linear regression were used for the statistical analyses.ResultsForty participants completed interventions and 35 finished the postoperative follow-up. Preoperatively, the intervention demonstrated main effects on quadriceps MVIC (p = 0.002), RTD0 - 50 (p = 0.024), RTD100 - 200 (p = 0.005) and CAR (p = 0.043). Furthermore, the effect of time* intervention interaction was significant on quadriceps MVIC (p = 0.011). Postoperatively, the WBV group achieved higher IKDC scores than the control group (p = 0.006).

BACKGROUND: Selecting appropriate performance-based and patient-reported tests that can detect side-to-side asymmetries, assess global knee function, and determine a participant's-readiness to return to activity after ACL reconstruction can be a challenge for rehabilitation specialists. A simple tool or questionnaire to identify athletes with neuromuscular impairments or activity limitations could provide rehabilitation specialists with crucial data pertinent to their patients' current knee function and readiness to return to higher-level activities. METHODS: One hundred ninety-four level I and level II athletes-who underwent ACL reconstruction participated in the study. One hundred fifty-eight athletes at 6 months after ACL reconstruction and 141 of the athletes at 12 months after ACL reconstruction completed a battery of functional tests to determine readiness to return to activity and the IKDC 2000 to determine self-reported knee function. For each athlete, status on the RTAC test battery was dichotomized into passed or failed, and status on the IKDC 2000 scores was dichotomized into within or below age- and sex-matched normal ranges. Comparisons were made between status on the RTAC test battery and the IKDC 2000 using chi-square tests. Accuracy statistics were also calculated. RESULTS: Six months after ACL reconstruction, 112 athletes (70.9%) failed RTAC and 76(48.1%) were classified as having self-reported knee function below normal ranges. Among the 76 participants with IKDC 2000 scores below normal ranges, 69(90.8%) failed the RTAC test battery (P<.001). However, among the 82 participants whose IKDC 2000 scores were within normal limits at,6 months, only 39(47.6%) passed the RTAC test battery (P = .74). Twelve months after ACL reconstruction, 67 athletes (47.5%) failed RTAC and 31 (22.0%) had knee function below normal ranges. Among the 31 participants with IKDC 2000 scores below normal ranges,25 (80.6%) failed the RTAC test battery (P<.001). However, among the 110 participants whose IKDC 2000 scores were within normal limits at 12 months, only 68 (61.8%) passed the RTAC test battery (P = .017). CONCLUSION: The IKDC 2000 may be a clinically relevant tool to determine the timeliness or necessity of RTAC testing. For scores obtained 6 and 12 months after ACL reconstruction, low IKDC 2000 scores were reasonably indicative of failure on the RTAC test battery, whereas normal IKDC 2000 scores were not predictive of passing scores on the RTAC test battery.

However, little attention has been given to outcomes during the early phase of recovery and how early deficits affect both short-and long-term outcomes. Objective: To identify relationships between demographic (age, sex, and body mass index [BMI]) and intraoperative (isolated ACLR versus primary ACLR+secondary procedures), and postoperative (range-of-motion [ROM] and peak isometric knee-extension force [PIF]) variables during the first 2 months after ACLR using self-reported outcomes. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Outpatient orthopaedic hospital. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 63 patients (38 men, 25 women; age -33.0 +/- 12.1 years; BMI = 26.3 +/- 6.5 kg/m(2)) who underwent ACLR. Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were collected at 1 and 2 months after ACLR and were compared with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form scores at 1, 2, and >= 12 months. Results: Significant relationships were identified between >= 12-month IKDC scores and the 1-month (Pearson correlation, r = 0.283, r(2) = 0.08; P = .025) and 2-month (r = 0.301, r(2) = 0.09; P = .017) IKDC scores. After controlling for other variables, we found that the PIF ratio measures at 1 and 2 months were positively associated with 1- and 2-month IKDC scores (P<.001) and BMI was negatively associated with both 1- and 2-month IKDC scores (P<.05). One-month IKDC scores were related to the 1-month difference in knee-flexion ROM (P - .04). Conclusions: The IKDC scores during the first 2 months were positively correlated with patients' perceptions of function on long-term IKDC scores. It also appears that improvements in lower extremity strength and flexion ROM deficits were positively associated with short-term IKDC scores.

Hypothesis: A comprehensive rehabilitation program supplemented with quadriceps strengthening in open kinetic chain (OKC) exercise will increase quadriceps strength and improve knee function without increasing static or dynamic sagittal tibial translation, compared with the same comprehensive rehabilitation program supplemented with quadriceps strengthening in closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise, in patients with acute ACL deficiency. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Forty-two patients were tested a mean of 43 days (range, 20-96 days) after an ACL injury. Patients were randomized to rehabilitation with CKC quadriceps strengthening (11 men and 9 women) or OKC quadriceps strengthening (13 men and 9 women). Aside from these quadriceps exercises, the 2 rehabilitation programs were identical. Patients were assessed after 4 months of rehabilitation. Sagittal static translation and dynamic tibial translation were evaluated with a CA-4000 electrogoniometer. Muscle strength, jump performance, and muscle activation were also assessed. Functional outcome was evaluated by determining the Lysholm score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Results: There were no group differences in static or dynamic translation after rehabilitation. The OKC group had significantly greater isokinetic quadriceps strength after rehabilitation (P =.009). The hamstring strength, performance on the 1-repetition-maximum squat test, muscle activation, jump performance, and functional outcome did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Rehabilitation with OKC quadriceps exercise led to significantly greater quadriceps strength compared with rehabilitation with CKC quadriceps exercise. Hamstring strength, static and dynamic translation, and functional outcome were similar between groups. Patients with ACL deficiency may need OKC quadriceps strengthening to regain good muscle torque.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2008,36,2,,,,,298,307,,10.1177/0363546507307867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546507307867,,,,,,,,17940146,,,,,WOS:000252663900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

This caused that in own research an attempt was made to present the possibilities of using the selected method of electrical stimulation in the treatment of an orthopaedic patient. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of electro stimulation of the quadriceps muscle in patients after ACL reconstruction, with the use of High Tone Power Therapy. Methods: In randomized controlled trial took part thirty-five men, aged 21-50, after ACL reconstruction. The tests were carried prior to and 6 months following the ACL reconstruction. After the surgery, the patients were randomly divided into experimental group (17 patients) with the High Tone Power Therapy in rehabilitation and control group (18 patients) without the High Tone Power Therapy. Patients were subjected to 6-month rehabilitation. Research tools included the measurement of muscle strength torque, ROM, knee and thigh circumference measurements, the Lysholm and the VAS scale. Results: After applying HiToP, the analysis showed a statistically significant improvement of muscle torque (p = 0.041, Es= 3.71), knee circumference (p = 0.039, Es = 1.65), thigh circumference (p = 0.049, Es= 1.26), knee extension (p < 0.001, Es =2.20) in Experimental group compared to the control group. Only the results of the VAS scale did not differ statistically significantly both within a given group and between groups. Conclusions: The results confirm the hypothesis that the use of HiToP in patients after ACLr have a beneficial effect on muscle strength, reduction of joint effusion, muscle mass gain and joint function. The assumption that HiToP significantly reduces pain levels is not supported - the results in both groups are statistically insignificant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 23,2021,22,1,,,,,,,975,10.1186/s12891-021-04862-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12891-021-04862-w,,,,,,,,34814896,,,,,WOS:000721881600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there are no clinical trials that evaluated outcomes of OKC exercises in a restricted ROM for pain, function, muscle strength, and anterior knee laxity at 1 year after surgery. Purpose: To determine if an early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strength in a restricted ROM would promote a clinical improvement without causing increased anterior knee laxity in patients after ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 49 patients between 16 and 50 years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus and gracilis autografts were randomly assigned to an early start OKC (EOKC) exercise group or a late start OKC (LOKC) exercise group. The EOKC group (n = 25; mean age, 26 years) received a rehabilitation protocol with an early start of OKC (fourth week postoperatively) within a restricted ROM between 45 degrees and 90 degrees. The LOKC group (n = 24; mean age, 24 years) performed the same protocol with a late start of OKC exercises between 0 degrees and 90 degrees (12th week postoperatively). Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Lysholm knee scoring scale, single-legged and crossover hop tests, and anterior knee laxity were measured to assess outcomes at the 12-week, 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month postoperative follow-up (range, 13-24 months). Results: No difference (P<.05) was noted between groups with respect to demographic data. Both groups (EOKC and LOKC) had a higher level of function and less pain at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month assessments when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P<.05). The EOKC group had improved quadriceps muscle strength at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month follow-up when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P<.05); the LOKC group showed improvement only at the 17-month postoperative assessment. However, the analysis between groups showed no difference for all pain and functional assessments, including anterior knee laxity (P>.05). Conclusion: An early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strengthening in a restricted ROM did not differ from a late start in terms of anterior knee laxity. The EOKC group reached the same findings in relation to pain decrease and functional improvement when compared with the LOKC group but showed a faster recovery in quadriceps strength. The nonweightbearing exercises seem appropriate for patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction, when utilized in a specific ROM. The magnitude of difference in quadriceps strength between the 2 rehabilitation protocols was around 5%; however, this difference was not clinically significant, especially because both groups had equal function on the hop tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2013,41,4,,,,,788,794,,10.1177/0363546513476482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546513476482,,,,,,,,23423316,,,,,WOS:000318295500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the ideal graft source is still debatable. This study compared hamstring (HT) and bone-free quadriceps (QT) tendon autografts in terms of muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes.MethodsBetween June 2018 and December 2019, 46 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of two groups for the ACL reconstruction surgery-the HT autograft group or the QT autograft group. An experienced examiner performed preoperative and postoperative examinations. The HUMAC NORM isokinetic machine (Computer Sports Medicine International-CSMI, 2004) was used to assess flexor and extensor thigh muscle strength. Both groups received the same surgical technique and fixation method. All patients were examined after three, six, nine, and 12 months. The final evaluations were performed at the 24-month follow-up. Patients' scores on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form and the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale were used to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. The two groups were also compared in terms of postoperative complications and activity levels.ResultsThe difference between preoperative and postoperative knee flexor peak torques (FPT) was lower in the QT group than in the HT group. The average difference between preoperative and postoperative knee extensor peak torque (EPT) was higher in the QT group than in the HT group. As a result, the HT group had a lower postoperative H/Q ratio (flexor strength normalized to body mass divided by extensor strength normalized to body mass) than the QT group (p < 0.001). The mean IKDC scores for the HT and QT groups were 90.13 & PLUSMN; 6.99 and 87.12 & PLUSMN; 6.61, respectively. The scores of the two groups postoperatively were close, and both groups showed significant improvement. The average graft size in the QT group was significantly greater than that in the HT group. Saphenous nerve palsy was the most common complication in the HT group (22%). Thigh hematomas were observed in two patients in the QT group and required urgent intervention (12%).ConclusionAfter ACL reconstruction, we found a significant decrease in strength at the donor sites in both techniques, with similar patient-reported measures and stability outcomes. The H/Q strength ratio was higher in the QT group postoperatively, which may have a protective effect on the reconstructed ligament.Level of Evidence I It is a randomized controlled trial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2024,34,1,,,,,293,301,,10.1007/s00590-023-03636-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00590-023-03636-5,,JUL 2023,,,,,,37468645,,,,,WOS:001032031200001,View Full Record in Web of Science
