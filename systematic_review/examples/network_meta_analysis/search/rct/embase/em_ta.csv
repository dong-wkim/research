Limited level 1 data exist comparing outcomes of different soft tissue allograft constructs for ACL reconstruction. We hypothesized no difference would exist in the patient reported outcomes (PRO), arthrometric testing, or rate of re-rupture between the two constructs. Methods Ninety eight subjects undergoing primary ACL reconstruction were randomized to HT (n = 47) or TA (n = 51) allograft. Subjects completed validated (PRO) measures pre-operatively, and six months and two years post-operatively. Arthrometric testing was performed at six months to assess integrity of the reconstruction. Results Fifty-eight percent of subjects (57/98) completed a two-year follow up. Allograft re-tear rates were similar between groups (6.2% HT vs. 4.0% TA, respectively, p = 1.0). The relative risk of re-tear in the HT group was 1.5 compared to the TA group (p = 0.7). The TA group improved significantly more on the physical portion of the VR-12 (p = 0.046) and Lysholm score (p = 0.014) compared to the HT group. There was no difference in the change from baseline for the other PRO scores at two years. Conclusions Our data indicate no difference in graft failure rate and similar improvement from baseline in most PRO scores between treatment groups after two years. Based on these findings, TA allograft appears to provide a reliable and satisfactory option for patients who elect to undergo allograft ACL reconstruction.",,,ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01148784),English,English,20160908639,27876265,L613675059,10.1016/j.knee.2016.08.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2016.08.011,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L613675059&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=18735800&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.knee.2016.08.011&atitle=A+prospective+randomized+comparison+of+two+distinct+allogenic+tissue+constructs+for+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction&stitle=Knee&title=Knee&volume=23&issue=6&spage=1112&epage=1120&aulast=Rose&aufirst=Michael+B&auinit=M.B.&aufull=Rose+M.B.&coden=KNEEF&isbn=&pages=1112-1120&date=2016&auinit1=M&auinitm=B,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

When traveling from inside to outside and from top to bottom in the front of the knee, the patellar branch of the saphenous nerve runs parallel to the hamstring tendon. Therefore, to cut the tendon can lead to tibialis anterior skin sensitivity loss. To alter the incision direction may reduce the impact on the anterior tibial skin sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of incisions in different directions for cutting the hamstring tendon on the anterior tibial skin sensitivity in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury admitted from July 2013 to February 2014 were enrolled. These patients underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon, and randomly divided into oblique incision group (n=37) and vertical incision group (n=37). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in the incision length between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with the vertical incision group, the area of skin sensitivity loss was smaller in the oblique incision group at 2 days, 1 month and 3 months after reconstruction (P < 0.05), but after 6 months, there was no difference in the area of skin sensitivity loss and Lysholm scores between the two groups (P > 0.05). These findings indicate that during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the oblique and vertical incisions have similar effects on had no effect on postoperative recovery of anterior tibial skin sensitivity and knee function.",,,,Chinese,"English, Chinese",2015399103,,L606126643,10.3969/j.issn.2095-4344.2014.51.023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.2095-4344.2014.51.023,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L606126643&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=16738225&id=doi:10.3969%2Fj.issn.2095-4344.2014.51.023&atitle=Autologous+hamstring+tendon+for+anterior+cruciate+ligament+reconstruction%3A+Influence+of+incisions+in+different+directions+for+cutting+the+hamstring+tendon+on+the+anterior+tibial+skin+sensitivity&stitle=Chin.+J.+Tissue+Eng.+Res.&title=Chinese+Journal+of+Tissue+Engineering+Research&volume=18&issue=51&spage=8320&epage=8324&aulast=Li&aufirst=Jiu-Yuan&auinit=J.-Y.&aufull=Li+J.-Y.&coden=&isbn=&pages=8320-8324&date=2014&auinit1=J&auinitm=-Y,"Copyright 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Methods: Thirty-two of the 57 patients with ACL-R using tibialis anterior grafts completed the study. The patients in the lightened rehabilitation program were compared with patients in standard rehabilitation program. The two groups were assessed using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, isokinetic knee muscle strength, knee joint position sense, and hop test. Results: There were no significant differences in muscle strength of the quadriceps and hamstring at 60°/s, 180°/s, and 330°/s between the operative and non-operative side in the lightened rehabilitation group while there was significant difference in muscle strength of the quadriceps and hamstring at 60°/s between the operative and nonoperative side in the standard rehabilitation group. There were significant differences in muscle strength of the quadriceps and hamstring at 330°/s and joint position sense at 75°, 45°, and 15° between the operative side of the patients in lightened rehabilitation group and operative side of the patients in standard rehabilitation group. There was no difference in the knee joint position sense at 15°, 45°, and 75°, between the operative and non-operative side in the both groups. Conclusion: Clinical relevance of this study is that the new lightened rehabilitation program should be also succeeding as much as standard rehabilitation program after ACL-R. It is suggested that future studies might evaluate the effects of the new lightened rehabilitation program for different grafts and professional athletes.",,,,English,English,20160626932,,L611784198,10.1177/2325967114S00274,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967114S00274,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L611784198&from=export,https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/openurl/01JHU_INST/01JHU_INST:JHU?sid=EMBASE&sid=EMBASE&issn=23259671&id=doi:10.1177%2F2325967114S00274&atitle=Do+the+patients+really+need+concentrated+and%2For+accelerated+rehabilitation+program+after+ACL+surgery%3F+A+new+lightened+rehabilitation+program%3A+A+prospective+-+Double+blind+-+Randomized-+controlled+study&stitle=Orthop.+J.+Sports+Med.&title=Orthopaedic+Journal+of+Sports+Medicine&volume=2&issue=11&spage=&epage=&aulast=Kaya&aufirst=Defne&auinit=D.&aufull=Kaya+D.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2014&auinit1=D&auinitm=,"Copyright 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
