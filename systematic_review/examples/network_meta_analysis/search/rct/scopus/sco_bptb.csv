Despite excellent outcomes, complications such as patella fractures, reported as high as 1.8%, remain a concern. This study aimed to update the incidence of patella fractures after BTB ACL reconstruction at a high-volume center and compare patient outcomes with isolated ACL rupture or patella fracture. We hypothesized a lower incidence than previously reported and comparable post-operative outcomes across groups. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing BTB ACL reconstruction (2012–2022) who sustained harvest site patella fractures. Cases were 2:1 propensity score-matched with patients having isolated ACL rupture or patella fracture. Inclusion criteria were age > 18, ≥ 1-year follow-up, and post-op patella fracture diagnosis. Data collected included demographics, surgical details, bone plug dimensions, and patient-reported outcomes (Lysholm, IKDC, Tegner Activity Scale). Treatment strategies and healing outcomes for patella fractures were also recorded. Results: Among 5770 BTB ACL reconstructions, 12 patients (0.21%) sustained post-op patella fractures. They were matched to 24 with isolated ACL rupture and 24 with patella fracture. Average follow-up was 6.4 years. Pre-op scores demonstrated significant differences: ACL + patella fracture group had lower Lysholm (62.8), IKDC (48.1), and Tegner scores (7.1) compared to isolated ACLR and patella fracture groups. Post-op scores in the ACL + patella fracture group improved significantly (Lysholm 84.4, IKDC 72.0). Conclusions: Patella fracture incidence after BTB ACL reconstruction is lower than previously reported (0.21%). Patients with this complication still achieve excellent outcomes comparable to those with isolated ACL or patella injuries. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2025.","ACL reconstruction; Complication; Outcome; Patella fracture","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anthropometric parameters; Article; assessment of humans; autograft; body mass; bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft; cohort analysis; female; general anesthesia; human; incidence; International Knee Documentation Committee score; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Patella bone plug size; patella fracture; Patellar tendon width; patient-reported outcome; people by smoking status; prospective study; range of motion; retrospective study; Tegner activity score; Tibia bone plug size; adverse event; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; epidemiology; etiology; fracture; injury; middle aged; patella; postoperative complication; procedures; propensity score; surgery; young adult; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Female; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Patella Fracture; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Postoperative Complications; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Transplantation, Autologous; Young Adult","","","SPSS Version 29, IBM","IBM","","","Anderson, Allen F., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

The purpose of this study was to establish a correlation of morphological parameters of the knee in (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI with functional outcome in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Material and methods: This was an observational study which included 63 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Morphological parameters such as notch width index, medial and lateral tibial slopes and patellar tendon tibial slope angle were interpreted. Functional outcome was measured using IKDC (International knee documentation committee) score and Tegnor-Lysholm scores at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post operatively. Results: Group 1(NWI) had least IKDC score (77.5 ± 8.5) and Tegnor-Lysholm score (79 ± 3) at 12 months among patients when compared with other single abnormal morphological parametric values. Group 10 (NWI + PTTS) had least IKDC scores (79 ± 2) and Tegnor-Lysholm scores (91) at 12 months. Overall group 15 (LTS + PTTS) had better IKDC scores (85.3 ± 0.94) and Tegnor-Lysholm scores (93.3 ± 2.4) at 12 months among all the other groups considered. Thirty patients had abnormal notch width index. Conclusion: Evaluation of knee morphology is important in anterior cruciate ligament injuries as the relevant indices correlate with surgical outcome and helps the surgeon to choose an approach to minimize graft failure. Notch width index is the best of these indices to assess the future likely functional outcome in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients having a narrow intercondylar notch width index are at risk of having a poor functional outcome post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. © 2025 The Authors","Abnormal morphological parametric values; Anterior cruciate ligament; Lateral tibial slope; Medial tibial slope; Notch width index; Patellar tendon tibial angle","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; functional status; human; International Knee Documentation Committee scale; lateral tibial slope; lower limb radiographic parameter; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; medial tibial slope; notch width index; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; patellar tendon tibial slope; postoperative period; Tegner activity score; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament injury; convalescence; diagnostic imaging; knee joint; pathophysiology; procedures; surgery; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Recovery of Function; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Parsons, Joanne L., Anterior cruciate ligament injury: Towards a gendered environmental approach, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 55, 17, pp. 984-990, (2021); Kiapour, Ata M., Basic science of anterior cruciate ligament injury and repair, Bone and Joint Research, 3, 2, pp. 20-31, (2014); Cheung, Edward C., Osteoarthritis and ACL Reconstruction—Myths and Risks, Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine, 13, 1, pp. 115-122, (2020); Suprasanna, K., Comparison of anatomical risk factors for noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury using magnetic resonance imaging, Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma, 10, 1, pp. 143-148, (2019); Huang, Mengquan, Relationship between intercondylar notch angle and anterior cruciate ligament injury: a magnetic resonance imaging analysis, Journal of International Medical Research, 47, 4, pp. 1602-1609, (2019); Kataoka, Kiminari, Steeper lateral posterior tibial slope and greater lateral-medial slope asymmetry correlate with greater preoperative pivot-shift in anterior cruciate ligament injury, Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics, 9, 1, (2022); Yu, Bing, Mechanisms of non-contact ACL injuries, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, SUPPL. 1, pp. i47-i51, (2007); Gültekin, Muhammet Zeki, Morphometric risk factors effects on anterior cruciate ligament injury, Joint Diseases and Related Surgery, 34, 1, pp. 130-137, (2022); Cerveri, Pietro, Predicting Knee Joint Instability Using a Tibio-Femoral Statistical Shape Model, Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology, 8, (2020); Yellin, Joseph L., Narrow Notch Width is a Risk Factor for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in the Pediatric Population: A Multicenter Study, Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation, 3, 3, pp. e823-e828, (2021)","K.R.

The knee joint is the most frequently injured joint, with the ACL being the most commonly affected ligament. The most commonly used grafts are hamstring autograft and bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. In this study, we are highlighting anatomical ACL reconstruction by hamstring autograft. This study was undertaken to evaluate the results of arthroscopic anatomical ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft using the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. Methods: This is the study of 40 cases of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using hamstring autograft in a medical center in Ahmedabad, India, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Results: Results in this study are calculated according to the Lysholm Knee Score. 55% of patients showed excellent results, 40% showed good results, and 5% showed fair results. Average Lysholm Score was 90 in 40 patients. Conclusion: Anatomical ACL reconstruction using hamstring autograft technique has yielded excellent to good results in almost all patients with minimal complication and provided stable knees. © 2025 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

However, measuring the true intra-articular tendinous graft diameter of the soft tissue portion of a BPTB graft with standard intraoperative methods is difficult while keeping the graft intact. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of the study was to use 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements to determine the cross-sectional area of the soft tissue, tendinous portion of a standard BPTB autograft with 10-mm diameter bone plugs, and, by calculation, the collagen graft size (ie, graft diameter), as would typically be reported in ACL reconstruction studies that consider soft tissue graft size. It was hypothesized that the calculated collagen graft diameter of 10-mm BPTB autografts would be significantly smaller than 10 mm. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 100 patients (10 girls and 10 boys at each age from 13 to 17 years) who underwent a knee MRI at a single academic orthopaedic center without documented extensor mechanism pathology were identified. The central 10-mm width of the patellar tendon that would be harvested for BPTB autograft was measured. The region of interest area tool was then used to measure the cross-sectional area of a 10-mm BPTB graft with subsequent soft tissue autograft diameter calculation. Results: The mean calculated tendinous graft diameter of a 10 mm–wide BPTB graft was 6.3 ± 0.5 mm and was significantly smaller than a 10-mm reference (P≤.001). There was no significant association between age and cross-sectional area or graft diameter. Conclusion: Modern 3-dimensional imaging-based measurement techniques demonstrated that the true intra-articular tendinous soft tissue portion of 10-mm BPTB autografts shows substantial variation and is significantly smaller in diameter than the tunnels typically reamed to accommodate the bone plug portions of these grafts. Moreover, as graft size is a predictor of rupture rate, preoperative MRI-based evaluation may be an important tool when considering BPTB autograft for ACL reconstruction. Future comparative clinical research utilizing graft size as a study variable should consider quantifying and utilizing the diameter of the soft tissue component of BPTB autografts. © The Author(s) 2024.","ACL; adolescent sports; knee; patellar tendon; pediatric ACL; pediatric sports medicine","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; body mass; bone transplantation; cross-sectional study; female; femoral condyle; graft size; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; range of motion; surgical technique; tendon graft; three-dimensional imaging; tissue graft","","","","","","","Baghdadi, Soroush, Quadriceps Tendon Autograft in Pediatric ACL Reconstruction: Graft Dimensions and Prediction of Size on Preoperative MRI, Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 9, 12, (2021); Beaufils, Phillippe, Mini-invasive technique for bone patellar tendon bone harvesting: Its superiority in reducing anterior knee pain following ACL reconstruction, Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine, 4, 2, pp. 45-51, (2011); Brockmeyer, Matthias, Size and Morphology of the Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligaments at Different Pediatric Age Intervals: An MRI Analysis, Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine, 11, 10, (2023); Cassel, Michael, Physiological tendon thickness adaptation in adolescent elite athletes: A longitudinal study, Frontiers in Physiology, 8, OCT, (2017); Chondros, Thomas G., Archimedes life works and machines, Mechanism and Machine Theory, 45, 11, pp. 1766-1775, (2010); Cicchetti, Domenic V., Developing criteria for establishing interrater reliability of specific items: Applications to assessment of adaptive behavior, American Journal of Mental Deficiency, 86, 2, pp. 127-137, (1981); Clinger, Bryce N., Quadriceps tendon autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: state of the art, Journal of ISAKOS, 7, 6, pp. 162-172, (2022); Del-Baño-Aledo, María Elena, Ultrasound measures of tendon thickness: Intra-rater, inter-rater and inter-machine reliability, Muscles, Ligaments and Tendons Journal, 7, 1, pp. 192-199, (2017); Dodwell, Emily Ruth, 20 years of pediatric anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in New York state, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 42, 3, pp. 675-680, (2014); El-Khoury, Georges Y., MR imaging of patellar tendinitis, Radiology, 184, 3, pp. 849-854, (1992)","P.D.

Free grafts are avascular and theirs tibial side fixation insufficiency is a potential cause of failure in ACL reconstruction. Tibial attachment preserving hamstring graft preserves the vascularity and mechanical strength on the tibial side, and could be a viable option in an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, The authors describe the early outcome of the surgical technique of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with tibial attachment sparing hamstring graft without implant on the tibial side. Material and methods: The hamstring insertion preserving five stranded graft was used for ACL reconstruction with adjustable endobutton for femoral side fixation and no implant for tibial side fixation. Thirty-six patients with one-year follow-ups were included in the study. Results: The mean length of the prepared graft attached to the tibia was 95.5 ± 4 mm, and the mean width was 8.6 ± 0.7 mm and 8.2 ± 0.6 mm on the tibial and femoral side respectively. None had a failure of graft till the final follow-up. The preoperative International knee documentation committee score (IKDC) mean score improved from 47.3 ± 8.9 to 87.3 ± 6.7 at one-year follow-up. The preoperative Lysholm score (LS) improved from 58.1 ± 12.8 to 90.4 ± 4.9 at one-year follow-up. Conclusion: Attachment-sparing hamstring graft with a femoral side-only implant is a simple, cost-effective technique that provides a satisfactory outcome. © 2023 The Authors","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Femoral side fixation only; Hamstring graft; Tibial attachment preserving","","","","","","","","Janssen, Rob Paulus Augustinus, Intra-articular remodelling of hamstring tendon grafts after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 22, 9, pp. 2102-2108, (2014); Deehan, David John, The biology of intergration of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 87, 7, pp. 889-895, (2005); Sinha, Skand, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with tibial attachment preserving hamstring graft without implant on tibial side, Indian Journal of Orthopaedics, 52, 2, pp. 170-176, (2018); Papachristou, Georgios K., ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus tendon autograft without detachment of its tibial insertion: A histologic study in a rabbit model, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 15, 10, pp. 1175-1180, (2007); Löcherbach, Claus, Biologically enhanced ACL reconstruction, Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research, 96, 7, pp. 810-815, (2010); Lee, Byung-ill, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the tibial-remnant preserving technique using a hamstring graft, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 3, pp. 340-340.e7, (2006); Wagih, Ahmad M., Anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using in situ hamstring graft with 4 tunnels, Arthroscopy Techniques, 3, 1, pp. e49-e56, (2014); Buda, Roberto, Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using distally inserted doubled hamstrings tendons, Orthopedics, 36, 6, pp. 449-453, (2013); RUFFILLI, A., Hamstring graft tibial insertion preservation versus detachment in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective randomized comparative study, European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, 26, 6, pp. 657-664, (2016); Salman Ali, M., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon graft without detachment of the tibial insertion, Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, 126, 9, pp. 644-648, (2006)","V.

Methods: Using a single-surgeon patient registry, patients undergoing an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft were evaluated with minimum 2-year patient reported outcomes evaluated using Marx, Tegner, Lysholm, and International Knee Documentation Committee scales. Patients were divided into 3 groups: isolated ACL surgery, ACLR with a partial lateral meniscectomy, or a ACLR with partial lateral meniscectomy and lateral compartment chondroplasty. Results: A total of 98 patients met inclusion criteria. Using the isolated ACL reconstruction group as a control, we found that Marx scores were greater in patients who additionally underwent a partial lateral meniscectomy at 1 year (P = .016). There were no significant differences between the ACL-only group and the ACL with partial lateral meniscectomy and chondroplasty group. Within the partial meniscectomy cohort comparing the patients with red-white zone tears with the patients with white-white zone tear, we found there were no significant differences when compared with the ACL-only control. There were no significant differences appreciated between groups using the International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scales. Conclusions: ACL reconstruction using bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft with anteromedial portal drilling technique does not have any significant short-term (2-year outcome) differences in return to activity and patient-reported outcomes compared with if patients additionally have a partial lateral meniscectomy and/or lateral compartment chondroplasty. Additional partial lateral meniscectomy showed significantly greater Marx scores at 1 and 2 years’ postoperatively.

Purpose: To analyze the pattern of injury, return to play (RTP), and performance of a consecutive series of elite professional soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We evaluated the medical records of 40 consecutive elite soccer players who underwent ACLR by a single surgeon between September 2018 and May 2022. Patient age, height, weight, body mass index, position, injury history, affected side, RTP time, minutes played per season (MPS), and MPS as a percentage of playable minutes before and after ACLR were retrieved from medical records and from publicly available media-based platforms. Results: Included were 27 male patients (mean ± SD age at surgery, 23.2 ± 4.3 years; range, 18-34 years). The injury occurred during matches in 24 players (88.9%), with a noncontact mechanism in 22 (91.7%). Meniscal pathology was found in 21 patients (77.8%). Lateral meniscectomy and meniscal repair were performed in 2 (7.4%) and 14 (51.9%) patients, respectively, and medial meniscectomy and meniscal repair were performed in 3 (11.1%) and 13 (48.1%) patients, respectively. A total of 17 players (63.0%) underwent ACLR with bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft and 10 (37.0%) with soft tissue quadriceps tendon. Lateral extra-articular tenodesis was added in 5 patients (18.5%). The overall RTP rate was 92.6% (25 of 27). Two athletes moved to a lower league after surgery. The mean MPS% during the last preinjury season was 56.69% ± 21.71%; this decreased significantly to 29.18% ± 20.6% (P <.001) in the first postoperative season and then increased to 57.76% ± 22.89% and 55.89% ± 25.8% in the second and third postoperative seasons. Two (7.4%) reruptures and 2 (7.4%) failed meniscal repairs were reported. Conclusion: ACLR in elite UEFA soccer players was associated with a 92.6% rate of RTP and 7.4% rate of reinjury within 6 months after primary surgery. Moreover, 7.4% of soccer players moved to a lower league during the first season after surgery.

The patients were prospectively recruited to undergo ACL reconstruction with either 5-strand hamstring graft (group A) or 4-strand hamstring graft (group B) Results: In total, 45 patients were included into the study. The mean diameter of the final graft was 8.9 ± 0.6 cm in the 5-strand group and 7.5 ± 0.8 cm in the 4-strand group (P < .001). Four-strand graft diameter measurements were taken intraoperatively in the 5-strand group before preparation of the 5-strand graft. The mean graft diameter of the 4-strand grafts was similar in both groups: 7.3 ± 0.3 mm in group A and 7.5 ± 0.8 mm in group B (P = .72). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups of patients in terms of the Lysholm score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Symptoms, KOOS Pain, KOOS Activities of Daily Living, KOOS Sports and KOOS Quality of Life scores. There were no postoperative complications of wound infection in both groups of patients. There was one case of graft rupture (4.8%) in the 4-strand group, which required revision reconstruction with patellar tendon graft 9 months postoperatively. There was no case of graft rupture in the 5-strand group (P = .29) Conclusions: The 5-strand hamstring graft technique provides a graft with significantly larger graft diameter than the quadrupled graft technique, with satisfactory short- to medium-term outcomes. The 5-strand graft is therefore a useful technique to increase the graft size when faced with the problem of small hamstring graft.

S., Department of Medicine, San Matteo IRCCS Polyclinic Foundation, Pavia, Italy","SUMMARY: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most commonly injured knee ligament. Currently there are two commonly used surgical procedures: middle third patellar tendon grafts (bone-patellar tendon-bone: BTB) and semitendinosus autografts or semitendinosus combined with gracilis tendon autografts (ST/G). Purpose. The aim of this study is to compare the rehabilitation results over time of amateur sportsmen who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery by means of one of the two most commonly used procedures: middle third patellar tendon grafts (bone-patellar tendon-bone: BTB) and semitendinosus and gracilis tendon autografts (ST/G). Method. 30 subjects divided into two groups, (15 BTB and 15 ST / G), were evaluated during rehabilitation and at three follow-up periods (16 weeks, 24 weeks, 2 years). Evaluation involved clinical examination, isokinetic tests, and functional rating scales: Lysholm and IKDC. Results. The clinical evaluation resulted in the following mean values: the value of the Lysholm score was 78 in both group at 16 weeks, 91 in group A and 94 in group B at 24 weeks, 98 in group A and 99 in group B at 2 years; the value of the IKDC score was 14 in group A and 15 in group B at 16 weeks, 12 in group A and 14 in group B at 24 weeks, 14 in group A and 15 in group B at 2 years. No major complications occurred during rehabilatation Conclusions. Subjects in both groups showed good neoligament stability up to the 24-week follow up. At the 2-year follow-up the subjects of group B showed poor neoligament stability that prevented the return to the previous level of sporting activity; all the subjects with high intensity sports activity needed a greater muscle strengthening. No statistically significant differences between the two groups are seen. ©© by GIMLE.","anterior cruciate ligament; functional assessment; rehabilitation; sedentary work","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autotransplantation; human; patellar ligament; procedures; surgery; tendon; transplantation; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Humans; Patellar Ligament; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","15927830","","","36622826","Italian","G Ital Med Lav Ergon","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145955953"

Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, United States","Background: Multiple graft options exist for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in an adolescent athlete. Patellar tendon harvest can lead to anterior knee pain, while hamstring tendon harvest can affect knee flexion strength and alter mechanics. Allograft is less desirable in pediatric patients due to the higher failure rate and slight risk of disease transmission. Quadriceps tendon autograft has rarely been reported for adolescent ACL reconstruction in the USA, but is an excellent option due to its large size, low donor site morbidity, and versatility. The purpose of this study is to report the outcomes of adolescents who have undergone ACL reconstruction using quadriceps tendon autograft. Methods: Twenty-two ACL reconstructions using the quadriceps autograft were performed on 21 pediatric patients by the senior author between 2010 and 2017. The patient’s demographics, injury characteristics, imaging, physical examination findings, operative findings, outcomes and sports were recorded. Results: The average age at the time of surgery was 15 years. Two patients had open physes; the remainder had closing physes. 64% of patients had additional meniscal tears and 76% had bony contusions. The average duration of follow-up was 2.8 years (range 2–5 years). At final follow-up, there were no angular deformities or leg length discrepancies. The average quadriceps atrophy of the operative leg was 4 mm. The average Lysholm score was 98. 86% of patients returned to sports. No patients had re-rupture of their operative ACL. No incidences of infections, numbness, or anterior knee pain were reported. Two patients had a second arthroscopy for re-injury, revealing new meniscal tears but intact ACL grafts. Conclusions: Use of quadriceps tendon autograft for ACL reconstruction in adolescent patients allows reliable return to sport with minimal complications.

Finite element models provide an effective platform for systemically determining the effect of possible injury risk factors on ACL strain concentrations. However, the accuracy of a finite element model relies on the accuracy of the material models used in its construction. Standard material characterization methods require an assumption of both deformation and material homogeneity, but our recent work has demonstrated that structural features like the shape of the ligament–bone attachment (enthesis) and collagen fiber splay (material direction heterogeneity) create unavoidable deformation heterogeneity. Hence, in this study, full-volume, full-field, finite deformation methods were used to build material models for the ovine ACL bundles and patellar tendon. Specifically, displacement-encoded magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure five full-volume deformation fields of each ligament (n=5 specimens of each) under tension, and the virtual fields method (VFM) was used to determine material model parameters with these data. This method accounts for strain heterogeneity, principal material direction heterogeneity (fiber splay), and enthesis shape. While most constitutive parameters were consistent among all specimen groups, parameters describing the degree of anisotropy, or collagen fiber alignment, showed statistically significant differences between groups. This work demonstrates that (when strain heterogeneity and structural properties are accounted for) ligament material properties are deterministic and ligament material microstructure is detectable with mesoscale measures of mechanical function. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","ACL; Anisotropy; Collagen alignment; Displacement-encoded MRI; Full-field; Ligament; Material properties; Mechanics; Microstructure; Virtual fields method","Anisotropy; Collagen; Deformation; Finite element method; Magnetic resonance imaging; Materials properties; Tendons; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Collagen alignment; Displacement-encoded magnetic resonance imaging; Finite-element models; Full-field; Material models; Patellar Tendon; Property; Virtual field methods; Microstructure","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1256260, 1537711); National Science Foundation, NSF","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation, USA under grant No. 1537711 .

Methods: In total, 103 patients who underwent ACL reconstructions using BPTB grafts were included. Tunnel aperture area was measured using three-dimensional computed tomography 1 week and 1 year postoperatively, and the tibial TW was calculated. The patients were divided into group S comprising 58 patients who had tibial TW < 30% and group L comprising 45 patients who had tibial TW > 30%, retrospectively. Using univariate analyses, age, gender, body mass index, Tegner activity scale, the time between injury and surgery, tibial tunnel location, tibial tunnel angle, medial posterior tibial slope, lateral posterior tibial slope, and length of the tendon in the tibial tunnel were compared between two groups. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to reveal the independent risk factors for the tibial TW among preoperative demographic factors and radiographic parameters that correlated with the tibial TW in the univariate analyses. Results: Compared with those at 1 week postoperatively, mean tibial tunnel aperture areas were increased by 30.3% ± 26.8% when measured at 1 year postoperatively. The lateral posterior tibial slope was significantly larger (p < 0.001), and the length of the tendon within the tibial tunnel was significantly longer in group L than that in group S (p = 0.03) in the univariate analyses. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the increase in lateral posterior tibial slope (p = 0.001) and the length of the tendon within the tibial tunnel (p = 0.03) were predictors of the tibial TW. Conclusions: This study showed that increased lateral posterior tibial slope and a longer tendinous portion within the tibial tunnel were independent factors that predicted the tibial TW following anatomical ACL reconstruction with a BPTB graft.

Methods Thirty-eight patients recovering from primary unilateral ACLR (22 men/16 women; 19 patellar tendon autograft/19 hamstring autograft; age: 16.3 ± 1.9 yr; 25.7 ± 6.2 wk postoperative) completed the Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) and 10 bilateral stop-jumps. Three-dimensional lower extremity kinematics and kinetics were collected at 240 and 1920 Hz, respectively. Peak knee extension moment limb symmetry index (LSI) was computed during the first landing of the stop-jump. The relationship between the ACL-RSI and peak knee extension moment LSI was determined using Pearson correlations. Multivariate regression was used to determine the ability of the ACL-RSI, graft type, meniscal pathology, sex, time since surgery, stop jump entry speed, and jump height to predict knee extension moment LSI. Results There was a significant relationship between the ACL-RSI and peak knee extension moment LSI (r = 0.325; P = 0.047). The backward regression model found that 36.9% of the variance in knee extension moment LSI could be explained by the ACL-RSI (P = 0.040), graft type (P = 0.006), and jump height (P = 0.027). Conclusions There is a significant moderate association between psychological readiness for return to sport and asymmetric landing kinetics in patients after ACLR. Future work should investigate whether improving movement confidence results in improved kinetic landing symmetry. © Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.","BIOMECHANICS; LANDING MECHANICS; MOVEMENT ANALYSIS; REHABILITATION","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; biomechanics; female; human; kinetics; male; movement (physiology); physiology; psychology; return to sport; Adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Kinetics; Male; Movement; Return to Sport","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R21AR069865); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS","This study was funded by support from the National Institutes of Health, Grant number R21-AR069865.","Grindem, Hege, Simple decision rules can reduce reinjury risk by 84% after ACL reconstruction: The Delaware-Oslo ACL cohort study, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 50, 13, pp. 804-808, (2016); Kyritsis, Polyvios, Likelihood of ACL graft rupture: Not meeting six clinical discharge criteria before return to sport is associated with a four times greater risk of rupture, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 50, 15, pp. 946-951, (2016); Paterno, Mark Vincent, Incidence of second ACL injuries 2 years after primary ACL reconstruction and return to sport, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 42, 7, pp. 1567-1573, (2014); Webster, Kate E., Exploring the High Reinjury Rate in Younger Patients Undergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 44, 11, pp. 2827-2832, (2016); Øiestad, Britt Elin, Knee function and prevalence of knee osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective study with 10 to 15 years of follow-up, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 11, pp. 2201-2210, (2010); Øiestad, Britt Elin, The association between radiographic knee osteoarthritis and knee symptoms, function and quality of life 10-15 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 45, 7, pp. 583-588, (2011); Li, Ryan T., Predictors of radiographic knee osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 39, 12, pp. 2595-2603, (2011); van Meer, Belle Lore, Degenerative changes in the knee 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament rupture and related risk factors: A prospective observational follow-up study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 44, 6, pp. 1524-1533, (2016); Paterno, Mark Vincent, Biomechanical measures during landing and postural stability predict second anterior cruciate ligament injury after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and return to sport, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 10, pp. 1968-1978, (2010); Shimizu, Tomohiro, Abnormal Biomechanics at 6 Months Are Associated With Cartilage Degeneration at 3 Years After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 35, 2, pp. 511-520, (2019)","R.M.

The purpose of the study was to measure the in-vivo thickness of the available autograft options around the knee and to seek a correlation between the thickness of the tendons and the anthropometric data, patellar thickness and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) footprint sagittal diameter. Magnetic resonance imaging of 104 consecutive patients with suspected knee injuries were utilized for measurement of the in vivo thickness of pes anserinus tendon (diameter and cross-sectional area [CSA]), patellar tendon (PT) and quadriceps tendon (QT). Pearson’s coefficient was used to find out the relationship between the tendon thickness and anthropometric data, thickness of patella and ACL tibial foot print sagittal diameter. The mean diameters and CSA of the semitendinosus tendon (ST) and gracilis tendon (GT) were 3.77±0.49 mm, 11.62±1.62 mm2and 2.87±0.27 mm, 6.64±1.18 mm2respectively. QT and PT thicknesses were 7.36±0.87 mm and 4.50±0.62 mm respectively. Height and the patellar thickness were seen to have moderate correlation with ST and PT thickness. Weak correlation was seen between the other anthropometric variables and tendon thickness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of tendon sizes is a reliable method with good inter and intra-rater agreement. Assessment of these anatomical structures with help of MRI would be helpful in preoperative planning and can help in identifying those patients at risk of having smaller tendons. © © 2021.

Hypothesis: Patients who suffered a subsequent ACL injury would have a larger PTS than patients who did not suffer a subsequent injury after primary or revision ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Patients received primary (n = 2439) or revision (n = 324) ACL reconstruction with PTG and were followed prospectively to determine the rate of graft tear and contralateral ACL tear. The PTS was measured preoperatively on digital lateral view radiographs. Intersecting lines were drawn along the medial tibial plateau and posterior tibia; the value of the acute angle at the lines’ intersection was then subtracted from 90° to obtain the PTS. This procedure was completed by a clinical assistant with an intrarater reliability of 0.89. Chi-square analysis and t tests were used to determine the differences between rate of tears and measurements between groups. A threshold of PTS ≥10° was used for analysis. Results: The mean follow-up time was 11.6 ± 4.0 years. After primary surgery, the mean PTS in patients with graft tears was 5.4°± 3.1° versus 4.8°± 2.9° for patients without a tear (P =.041). The mean PTS was 4.9°± 3.4° for patients with contralateral tears (not statistically significantly different than the no-tear group; P =.80). Furthermore, patients with primary reconstruction with PTS ≥10° had a statistically significantly higher rate of graft tear (9.7%) than patients with PTS ≤9° (4.8%) (P =.003), but not a higher rate of contralateral tear. Among patients undergoing revision surgery, there were no statistically significant differences between the graft tear, contralateral tear, and no-tear groups with relation to PTS ≥10°. Conclusion: After primary ACL reconstruction, patients with PTS >10° had a higher rate of subsequent graft tear but not a higher rate of contralateral tear. With revision surgery, there was no significant association between PTS and the rate of subsequent tear. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering more radical interventions, such as osteotomy, to prevent retear in patients with high PTS. © 2021 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament; contralateral ACL tear; graft tear; patellar tendon autograft; posterior tibial slope","anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; human; patellar ligament; reproducibility; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Autografts; Cohort Studies; Humans; Patellar Ligament; Reproducibility of Results","","","","","","","N Am J Sports Phys Ther, (2009); Chan, S.

Methods: Between 2003 and 2014 (first study period), 1,242 patients underwent ACL reconstruction using autografts, without soaking them in vancomycin solution, while between 2014 and 2019 (second study period) all ACL autografts in 593 patients were soaked in a 5-mg/ml vancomycin solution, in a territory University Hospital. The same standard treatment of perioperative IV antibiotics was applied in both groups. Results: Postoperative septic arthritis occurred in seven out of 1,242 patients (0.56%) during the first study period. Bone patellar tendon bone autograft was used in 311 (25%) patients, and hamstring tendon autograft was used in the rest 931 (75%) of the study population during this period. All infected cases were male and had a hamstrings graft implanted. There were no postoperative infections (0%) in 593 ACL reconstructions during the second study period. Bone patellar tendon bone autograft was used in 178 (30%) patients while hamstring tendon autograft was used in the rest 415 (70%) of the study population, during this period. Statistical analysis revealed a significantly reduced postoperative infection rate (p = 0.018) between the two reported periods, with the main impact referring to the use of hamstrings autograft (p = 0.031) for the first study period. Conclusions: Septic arthritis following ACL reconstruction can be significantly reduced (or even eliminated) by soaking ACL autografts in a 5 mg/ml vancomycin solution. Of note, this strategy seems to be more effective in the setting of hamstring tendon autograft use, since the risk of postoperative knee infection is significantly higher when this type of graft is used. © 2020, European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Graft soaking; Knee infection; Vancomycin","antiinfective agent; vancomycin; adult; adverse event; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; hamstring tendon; human; infectious arthritis; male; postoperative complication; procedures; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Arthritis, Infectious; Autografts; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Female; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Male; Postoperative Complications; Transplantation, Autologous; Vancomycin","","vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Vancomycin","","","","","Alomar, Abdulaziz Z., Hamstring autografts are associated with a high rate of contamination in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 26, 5, pp. 1357-1361, (2018); Barker, Joseph U., Effect of graft selection on the incidence of postoperative infection in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 2, pp. 281-286, (2010); Baron, Jacqueline E., Graft Preparation with Intraoperative Vancomycin Decreases Infection after ACL Reconstruction: A Review of 1,640 Cases, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - American Volume, 101, 24, pp. 2187-2193, (2019); Cadet, Edwin R., Management of septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A review of current practices and recommendations, Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 21, 11, pp. 647-656, (2013); Grayson, Jane E., The in vitro elution characteristics of vancomycin from tendons, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 469, 10, pp. 2948-2952, (2011); Hantes, M.

The hypothesis was that the ACLR rupture rate would be lower for thicker hamstring graft and bone patellar tendon bone (BPB) grafts in comparison to the classic hamstring technique. The ACLR failure rate was assessed according to graft type and patients’ sex. Methods: The NZ ACL registry was utilized to identify all patients aged 20 years or younger at the time of surgery who were skeletally mature and had a minimum 2-year follow-up. Graft ruptures, defined as an ACL revision, were identified according to graft type (traditional 4 strands hamstring semitendinosus and gracilis, 4 strands semitendinosus, 5–6 strands semitendinosus and gracilis, 7–8 strands semitendinosus and gracilis, bone-patella-bone graft). Results: Nine-hundred and ninety-two patients were included. At a mean follow-up of 38 months, 52 cases of graft rupture were recorded, (overall failure rate: 5.2%). The failure rate was not statistically influenced by the graft diameter. Patients with a thinner graft (< 8 mm—196 patients) had a similar failure rate (6%) to patients with a thicker graft (8 mm or more—485 patients) (6.2%). There was a lower failure rate in the BPB group (3.1%) versus all hamstrings group (6%) (ns). Finally, BPB in females had a lower failure rate than all hamstring constructs together (0% versus 5.1%; p = 0.023) Conclusion: In a young population traditional four-strand hamstring grafts, multiple strand configurations or BPB ACLR, whatever their size (> or < 8 mm), showed no significant difference in the failure rate in the NZ ACL registry. Female patients who had an ACL reconstruction with BPB graft had a significant lower failure rate than patients who had a hamstring graft.

The incidence of ACL injury has continued to increase, with most patients opting for surgery to improve stability as well as permit a return to sport. Traditional methods of ACL reconstruction can achieve this but are not without their problems, including graft rupture, residual laxity, and donor-site morbidity. There is therefore a requirement for further research into newer, innovative surgical techniques to help improve complication rates. This article describes, with video illustration, ACL reconstruction using a reduced-size bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft with suture tape augmentation. The augmentation acts as a stabilizer during the early stages of graft incorporation while resisting against reinjury during an accelerated recovery. The ability to use a reduced-size graft decreases the donor-site burden, and retention of residual native ACL tissue, when possible, may help with proprioception. © 2020","","","","","","","Arthrex","The authors report the following potential conflicts of interest or sources of funding: Arthrex facilitated the making of the video in this article.

This study aimed to characterize the chronological changes in anterior knee stability after anatomical ACL reconstruction and to compare the anterior knee stability achieved with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) and hamstring tendon (HT) grafts. A total of 59 patients underwent anatomical rectangular tunnel ACL reconstruction using the BPTB graft and 23 patients underwent anatomical double-bundle ACL reconstruction using the HT graft. Anterior knee stability was quantitatively assessed using the KneeLax 3 arthrometer at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery using side-to-side differences. The values for anterior knee stability using the BPTB graft were 0.3 mm after 6 months, 0.2 mm after 1 year, and 0.2 mm after 2 years, and no significant differences were observed during the postoperative study period. Meanwhile, the values for anterior knee stability using the HT graft were -0.3 mm after 6 months, 0.5 mm after 1 year, and 1.2 mm after 2 years, and anterior knee stability decreased chronologically from 6 months up to 2 years. Regarding anterior stability, the HT graft showed significant laxity compared with the BPTB graft only after 2 years. No chronological changes in anterior stability were observed from 6 months up to 2 years after ACL reconstruction using the BPTB graft, whereas anterior laxity developed during the same period after ACL reconstruction using the HT graft.

The TWINFIX™ titanium (Ti) suture anchor with ULTRABRAID™ Suture (Smith and Nephew, London, UK) was designed to secure tendon and ligament reconstructions with increased boney ingrowth at the anchor site with minimal invasive technique. This retrospective analysis looked at 33 patients (41 implants) operated with this device between 2015 and 2019 at a single institution. The average age of patients was 33.18 years (standard deviation [SD], 15.26), with an average body mass index of 24.88 (SD, 3.49). The indications were lateral extra-articular tenodesis during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction, quadriceps or patellar tendon repair and medial collateral ligament repair. After an average follow up of 24.3 + 6.53 months, there was no reports of clinical failure or radiographic evidence of implant failure or loosening. One patient experienced a complication unrelated to the study device, requiring manipulation under anesthesia with resolution of symptoms. This case series supports the safety and performance of this implants for the knee procedures in which its use is indicated. Additional follow-up will be required to determine whether these effects are sustained at medium- and long-term durations. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: The study was conducted with 25 patients (20 men and 05 women) with mean age of 32.3 years, mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.2, and mean lesion duration of 18.3 months. The treatment consisted of an Inlay reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) followed by the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, at least 3 months after the first surgical procedure. Four patients required additional procedures: patellar tendon (02), medial collateral ligament (MCL) (02). Results: With an average follow-up of 24.8 months, 60% of the patients scored zero or + at the posterior drawer test, while 40% scored ++; 60% of patients were evaluated as good/excellent according to the Lysholm scale. Only one patient reached the pre-injury Tegner activity level. Injury duration had a negative influence on functional limitation, vitality, and mental health (SF-36). Conclusion: Although two-stage bicruciate knee ligament reconstruction improved knee stability and self-assessment, 96% of patients did not recover their pre-injury state.

It has been hypothesized that proximal STO modifies patellar height and could cause varus/valgus changes of the anatomical tibial axis: The purpose of the study was to verify this and to analyse these modifications. Method: Patients underwent proximal STO in our department between 2007 and 2018: overall 28 consecutive patients (19 males, 9 females; 28 knees). Twelve patients underwent DTO, and 16 patients underwent FTO. Two independent observers measured the pre-operative and post-operative radiological indexes: posterior tibial slope, Caton-Deschamps Index (CDI) and Modified Insall-Salvati Index (MISI) in the lateral views; medial Tibial Plateau-Tibial Shaft (mTPTS) and medial Femoral Shaft-Tibial Shaft (mFTA) anatomical angles were measured in the frontal plane. Results: No complications were reported at the average follow-up of 1.6 ± 1.1 years. The mean mTPTS significantly increased from 0.6° ± 2.4° pre-operatively to 2.9° ± 2.6° of varus post-operatively (DTO (pre-operative 0.3 ± 3.1°, post-operative 2.4 ± 2.1°, ns); FTO (pre-operative 0.9 ± 1.9°, post-operative 3.2 ± 3.0°, P < 0.05)). The mean mFTA significantly reduced from 186.2° ± 4.9° pre-operatively to 182.7° ± 3.9° post-operatively (DTO (pre-operative 183.4 ± 3.3°, post-operative 180.6 ± 3.5°, ns); FTO (pre-operative 188.5 ± 4.9°, post-operative 184.4 ± 3.4°, P < 0.05)). The overall analysis reported no differences statistically significant in patellar height indexes. Discussion: The main finding of this study is that STO slightly modifies tibial anatomical axes. This finding is more evident in FTOs. This surgical technique, due to its design, does not influence the patellar height. The tibial tuberosity osteotomy, performed in most of the cases to better expose tibial metaphysis and to avoid patellar tendon damages, provides another benefit that is the possibility to easily preserve the native patellar height. Conclusion: Sagittal tibial osteotomies slightly modify tibial anatomical axes in frontal plan without influencing the patellar height. This surgical procedure resulted to be effective and reliable in correcting the sagittal knee alignment but reporting, particularly of FTO, varus changes of anatomical tibial axis. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.","Deflexion tibial osteotomy; Flexion tibial osteotomy; Knee instability; Posterior tibial slope; Sagittal tibial osteotomy","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone graft; clinical article; controlled study; deflexion tibial osteotomy; female; femoral shaft; flexion tibial osteotomy; follow up; genu recurvatum; human; idiopathic disease; knee function; knee instability; knee ligament surgery; male; medial tibial plateau; patella; patellar ligament; posterior cruciate ligament; postpoliomyelitis syndrome; posttraumatic complication; priority journal; range of motion; retrospective study; return to sport; sagittal tibial osteotomy; surgical technique; tibia osteotomy; tibial metaphysis; tibial plateau; tibial shaft; tibial tuberosity; weight bearing; diagnostic imaging; knee; knee osteoarthritis; osteotomy; surgery; tibia; alpha ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase FTO; FTO protein, human; Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Osteotomy; Patella; Patellar Ligament; Retrospective Studies; Tibia","","alkB protein; alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 1; alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 4; alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 5; alpha ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase alkB homolog 3; alpha ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase FTO; Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO; FTO protein, human","","","","","Bonasia, Davide Edoardo, Opening Wedge High Tibial Osteotomy and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction or Revision, Arthroscopy Techniques, 6, 5, pp. e1735-e1741, (2017); Dejour, David Henri, Tibial slope correction combined with second revision ACL produces good knee stability and prevents graft rupture, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 23, 10, pp. 2846-2852, (2015); Sonnery-Cottet, Bertrand, Proximal tibial anterior closing wedge osteotomy in repeat revision of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 42, 8, pp. 1873-1880, (2014); Magnussen, Robert A., Osteotomy for slope correction following failed ACL reconstruction, Revision ACL Reconstruction: Indications and Technique, 9781461407669, pp. 221-226, (2014); Martineau, Paul André, Anterior opening wedge high tibial osteotomy: The effect of increasing posterior tibial slope on ligament strain, Canadian Journal of Surgery, 53, 4, pp. 261-267, (2010); Surg J N Y, (2018); Schatka, Imke, High tibial slope correlates with increased posterior tibial translation in healthy knees, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 26, 9, pp. 2697-2703, (2018); Webb, Justin M., Posterior tibial slope and further anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed patient, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, 12, pp. 2800-2804, (2013); Giffin, J.

Material and method: This prospective and descriptive study was conducted over 100 patients, 96 of whom were involved in regular sports activity. They were all taken care of by the rehabilitation unit of CHU Mustapha Pacha of Algiers during 6 years. They all received the same medical rehabilitation program based on the closed kinetic chain, that considered the ligamentization phenomenon (estimated duration in men: 3 years) and mechanical constraints imposed to the knee and the plasty. The evaluation took place at day 0, day 21, month 2, month 3 and month 6 post-surgery, focusing on 5 major elements: pain, intra-articular effusion, joint mobility, muscle strength and amyotrophy. Stability of the knee was evaluated at month 6 post-surgery using IKDC, ARPEGE and Lysholm scores. The rate of activity recovery was evaluated at month 6 post-surgery. Results: Minimal pain: 2.99/10 on EVA scale. Profuse intra-articular effusion at day 21 in 50% of patients; absent at month 6 in 78% patients. Mobility continuously improved. Muscular strength is identical to the contra-lateral side at month 6 post-surgery for 65% patients in regards to the quadriceps muscle and for 70% patients in regards of the hamstring muscle. A 1 cm amyotrophy compared to the contralateral side, with a 10% loss of the muscular mass. Minimal residual laxity without any signs of instability for 9% of patients. Satisfactory results post closed kinetic chain rehabilitation: IKDC score objective A and B (normal to almost normal): 80%; IKDC score subjective: 84.24 points out of 100; Lysholm score: 93.10 point over 100; ARPEGE score: extremely good 94%; return to physical activity for 52.1% subjects. Discussion: Despite the satisfactory clinical and functional results obtained, the level of physical activity recovery remains moderate due to external influences such social, professional and psychological components; anxiety plays a major role as well. The recovery is finally more linked to a minimal dysfunction of the hamstring muscles rather than the quadriceps. That is why the proprioceptive rehabilitation of the Hamstring is a fundamental step in the recovery process. Conclusion: The rehabilitation protocol in closed kinetic chain developed in the eighties shows its importance up to these days. It is now applied in the knee ligamentoplasty rehabilitation program. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Accelerated rehabilitation; ACL; ACL reconstruction; Closed kinetic chain; IKDC; Kenneth Jones; Knee; Physical activity recovery","Algeria; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anxiety; Article; closed kinetic chain exercise; descriptive research; evaluation study; hamstring muscle; human; joint effusion; joint mobility; Kenneth Jones technique; knee arthroscopy; ligament surgery; Lysholm score; major clinical study; muscle atrophy; muscle mass; muscle strength; pain; patellar ligament; physical activity; proprioception; prospective study; quadriceps femoris muscle; sport injury; tendon transplantation; treatment outcome; university hospital","","","","","","","Boileau, Pascal, A plea for accelerated rehabilitation program after ACL repair with bone-tendon-bone graft, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 85, 5, pp. 475-490, (1999); Beynnon, Bruce D., The strain behavior of the anterior cruciate ligament during squatting and active flexion-extension.

In addition, we aimed to analyze the correlation between patient characteristics and tibial tunnel enlargement. Methods: This study included 50 patients who underwent ART ACLR. Lateral radiographs at the time of surgery and at 2 years were compared to evaluate the tibial tunnel enlargement. Subsequently, correlations between the tunnel enlargement and (1) length of tendinous portion inside the tibial tunnel or (2) characteristics of the patients, including anterior knee laxity measured by KT-1000 arthrometer, age, sex, height, body weight, and Tegner activity level scale, were analyzed. Results: The tibial tunnel was enlarged by 2.6 ± 4.2% 2 years postoperatively. The length of the tendinous portion inside the tibial tunnel was 7.8 ± 4.9 mm. There was no significant correlation between tunnel enlargement and length of tendinous portion inside the tunnel. None of the patient characteristics were detected as a risk factor for tibial tunnel enlargement. Conclusions: (1) The postoperative tibial tunnel enlargement was minimum after ART ACLR with a BTB graft.

A weak positive correlation was observed between the length of the tendon within the tibial tunnel and tibial TW (r = 0.270, p = 0.026). Mean tibial tunnel aperture area increased by 19.3 ± 17.4% and 35.8 ± 25.4% in the groups S and L, respectively. TW in the group L was significantly greater than that in the group S (p = 0.004). No significant difference was observed between the two groups in any clinical outcomes. In conclusion, a longer tendinous portion within the tibial tunnel resulted in a greater tibial TW following anatomical ACL reconstructions using a BTB graft. © 2020 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.","anterior cruciate ligament; bone-patellar tendon-bone graft; tibial tunnel; tunnel widening","adolescent; adult; anatomical variation; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; correlation coefficient; female; human; knee instability; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; measurement; musculoskeletal system parameters; outcome assessment; pivot shift test; postoperative period; retrospective study; tendon; three-dimensional imaging; tibia; tibial tunnel tendon length variation; tibial tunnel widening; algorithm; anterior cruciate ligament injury; diagnostic imaging; joint characteristics and functions; knee; middle aged; patellar ligament; pathology; physical examination; transplantation; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafts; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Physical Examination; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Tibia; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","","","Aquilion 64, Toshiba Medical Systems; Aquilion ONE, Toshiba Medical Systems; EndoButton, Smith and Nephew Endoscopy; FiberWire, Arthrex; KneeLax3; StealthStation TRIA plus, Medtronic; ZIOSTATION, Ziosoft","Toshiba Medical Systems; Toshiba Medical Systems; Smith and Nephew Endoscopy; Arthrex; Medtronic; Ziosoft","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (17K10955, 17K10997)","","Daraboš, Nikica, Intraarticular application of autologous conditioned serum (ACS) reduces bone tunnel widening after ACL reconstructive surgery in a randomized controlled trial, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 19, SUPPL1, pp. S36-S46, (2011); Hoeher, Jürgen, Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Fact or fiction?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 4, pp. 231-240, (1998); Sabat, Dhananjaya, Tunnel widening after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective randomized computed tomography-based study comparing 2 different femoral fixation methods for hamstring graft, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 27, 6, pp. 776-783, (2011); Baumfeld, Joshua A., Tunnel widening following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring autograft: A comparison between double cross-pin and suspensory graft fixation, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 16, 12, pp. 1108-1113, (2008); L'Insalata, John C., Tunnel expansion following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A comparison of hamstring and patellar tendon autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 4, pp. 234-238, (1997); Järvelä, Timo, Tunnel Enlargement After Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective, Randomized Study, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 24, 12, pp. 1349-1357, (2008); Wilson, Timothy C., Tunnel Enlargement after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 32, 2, pp. 543-549, (2004); Nakagawa, Takumi, Intraoperative 3-Dimensional Imaging-Based Navigation-Assisted Anatomic Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 24, 10, pp. 1161-1167, (2008); Taketomi, Shuji, Anatomical placement of double femoral tunnels in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Anteromedial tunnel first or posterolateral tunnel first?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 19, 3, pp. 424-431, (2011); Taketomi, Shuji, Secure fixation of femoral bone plug with a suspensory button in anatomical anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Joints, 3, 3, pp. 102-108, (2015)","S.

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of knee osteoarthritis at least 20 years after ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis: Factors associated with progression to knee osteoarthritis include meniscal lesions, level of physical activity, injury-to-surgery time, body mass index, residual laxity, tunnel position and cartilage injury. Material and methods: One hundred and eighty two patients were included in a multicentre retrospective study conducted in the setting of a SoFCOT symposium. Females contributed two-thirds of the study population. ACL reconstruction was performed arthroscopically in 82% of cases, and a bone-patellar tendon-bone transplant was used in 92.8% of cases. Mean age at surgery was 26 ± 7 years. Clinical outcomes were assessed based on the objective and subjective IKDC scores and on the KOOS. Radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis was classified according to the IKDC. Factors evaluated for their ability to predict progression to osteoarthritis included age, sex, body mass index, level of physical activity, injury-to-surgery time, meniscectomy, cartilage injury, tunnel position and residual laxity. Results: At last follow-up, the objective IKDC score was A (normal) for 48%, B for 35%, and C or D for 17% of the knees. The mean subjective IKDC score was 82.7 ± 13.1. Moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis was present in 29% of cases. The following risk factors for osteoarthritis were identified: medial or lateral meniscectomy, residual laxity, age > 30 years at surgery, and engaging in a pivoting sport. Meniscectomy was a major contributor to the development of osteoarthritis (17% of knees without vs. 46% with meniscectomy). Finally, the ACL re-tear rate was 13%. Conclusion: ACL reconstruction provides satisfactory knee stability. The risk of subsequent osteoarthritis depends chiefly on the status of the menisci. Residual laxity is also associated with the development of osteoarthritis. Level of evidence: IV, retrospective cohort study. © 2019","Anterior cruciate ligament; Long-term outcomes; Meniscectomy; Osteoarthritis; Reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthrolysis; arthroscopy; Article; controlled study; disease severity; female; follow up; human; joint laxity; knee arthroplasty; knee osteoarthritis; major clinical study; male; meniscectomy; open surgery; operation duration; physical activity; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; symposium; anterior cruciate ligament injury; clinical trial; knee; multicenter study; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Joint; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Retrospective Studies","","","","","Japan Orthopaedics and Traumatology Foundation, JOTF","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the French Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology (SoFCOT) .; Funding text 2: This study was funded by the French Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology (SoFCOT).","Gföller, Peter, Non-operative treatment of ACL injury is associated with opposing subjective and objective outcomes over 20 years of follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 27, 8, pp. 2665-2671, (2019); Dejour, Henri, Arthrosis of the knee in chronic anterior laxity, Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research, 100, 1, pp. 49-58, (2014); Conferences Enseign, (2005); Mihelić, Radovan, Long-term results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A comparison with non-operative treatment with a follow-up of 17-20 years, International Orthopaedics, 35, 7, pp. 1093-1097, (2011); Yamaguchi, Satoshi, Long term results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with iliotibial tract: 6-, 13-, and 24-year longitudinal follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 14, 11, pp. 1094-1100, (2006); Pernin, Jérome, Long-term follow-up of 24.5 years after intra-articular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with lateral extra-articular augmentation, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 6, pp. 1094-1102, (2010); Björnsson, Haukur, A randomized controlled trial with mean 16-year follow-up comparing hamstring and patellar tendon autografts in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 44, 9, pp. 2304-2313, (2016); Thompson, Simon Michael, Twenty-Year Outcome of a Longitudinal Prospective Evaluation of Isolated Endoscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Patellar Tendon or Hamstring Autograft, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 44, 12, pp. 3083-3094, (2016); Thaunat, Mathieu, Hamstring tendons or bone-patellar tendon-bone graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?, Orthopaedics and Traumatology: Surgery and Research, 105, 1, pp. S89-S94, (2019); Shelbourne, K.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the factors related to the tibial tunnel enlargement rate after anatomic ACL reconstruction with a bone–patellar tendon–bone (BTB) graft using multivariate analysis. Methods: Eighteen patients with unilateral ACL rupture were included. The anatomic rectangular-tunnel (ART) ACL reconstruction with a BTB autograft was performed. 3D CT models of the tibia, the tibial tunnel, and the bone plug at 3 weeks and 1 year after surgery were reconstructed and superimposed using a surface registration technique. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the tibial tunnel perpendicular to the tunnel axis was evaluated at the aperture. The CSA was measured at 3 weeks and 1 year after surgery, and the tunnel enlargement rate at the aperture was calculated. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to detect the significantly related factors to the tibial tunnel enlargement rate at the aperture among potential factors consisting of preoperative demographic factors and predisposing factors with the tibial tunnel. Results: The tibial tunnel enlargement rate at the aperture was 21.9 ± 14.1% (mean ± standard deviation). Multiple linear regression analysis detected the tendon length inside the tunnel as a significantly independent factor related to the tibial tunnel enlargement rate at the aperture (standardized β = 0.726, P = 0.008). There was no significant relationship between the tibial tunnel enlargement rate at the aperture and postoperative side-to-side difference (SSD) of the anterior knee laxity or Tegner activity level scale under single linear regression analysis. Conclusion: The greater tendon length inside the tunnel was independently related to the higher tibial tunnel enlargement rate at the aperture 1-year after anatomic ACL reconstruction with a BTB graft under multiple linear regression analysis. © 2019 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical article; cross-sectional study; disease predisposition; female; human; knee radiography; male; meniscal repair; Tegner activity score; tibia; tibial plateau; x-ray computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; procedures; surgery; three-dimensional imaging; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Tibia; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","","","","","","","Fahey, Mark, Bone Tunnel Enlargement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 410-414, (1994); Peyrache, M.

Because the mechanical environments for the QT and PT are different, the development of the QT and PT insertions may differ. Purpose: To investigate differences in the development of fibrocartilage layers in the QT and PT insertion sites in rabbits through use of quantitative morphometric evaluations. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: This study included 54 male Japanese White rabbits. Animals were euthanized at ages 1 day and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 weeks (n = 6 for each age). Chondrocyte number, proliferation, apoptosis, sex-determining region Y box 9 (Sox9)–positive rates, safranin O–stained glycosaminoglycan (GAG) areas, tidemark length, insertion width, and patellar length were evaluated and compared with the same parameters at age 24 weeks and between QT and PT insertion sites. Results: Chondrocyte proliferation was low up to age 2 weeks for QT insertion and low up to 1 week for PT insertion. Chondrocyte apoptosis was high at 1 day and Sox9 expression was low up to 1 week for PT insertion. Sox9 expression was higher in QT than in PT insertion at age 12 weeks. The high chondrocyte count continued to age 1 day in PT insertion and up to 6 weeks in QT insertion. The chondrocyte number was higher in QT than in PT insertion at age 2 weeks. The period of thicker GAG lasted from 2 to 8 weeks in PT insertion and from 1 to 12 weeks in QT insertion. GAG thickness in QT insertion was higher than in PT insertion at age 4 and 12 weeks. Conclusion: Development of fibrocartilage layers in QT and PT insertion sites was completed at age 24 weeks in rabbits. However, the period of high chondrocyte count and period of thicker GAG were longer in QT than in PT insertion up to 12 weeks. Clinical Relevance: Development of fibrocartilage layers in QT and PT insertions differed in rabbits. Our results may contribute to the development of appropriate treatments based on age and the development of methods for regeneration of the insertion. © The Author(s) 2020.","development; fibrocartilage layers; glycosaminoglycan; patellar tendon insertion; quadriceps tendon insertion","cycline; transcription factor Sox9; transforming growth factor beta; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; apoptosis; Article; cell proliferation; chondrocyte; fibrocartilage; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; Japanese White (rabbit); Leporidae; Lysholm score; male; microscopy; morphometry; nonhuman; patellar ligament; quadriceps femoris muscle; quadriceps tendon; quantitative study; rat; regeneration; tenocyte; TUNEL assay","","","BX-51, Olympus","Olympus","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (18K10846)","","Benjamin, Michael B., Fibrocartilage in tendons and ligaments - An adaptation to compressive load, Journal of Anatomy, 193, 4, pp. 481-494, (1998); Benjamin, Michael B., Where tendons and ligaments meet bone: Attachment sites ('entheses') in relation to exercise and/or mechanical load, Journal of Anatomy, 208, 4, pp. 471-490, (2006); Clark, John M., The interface between bone and tendon at an insertion site: A study of the quadriceps tendon insertion, Journal of Anatomy, 192, 4, pp. 605-616, (1998); Fink, Christian, Minimally Invasive Quadriceps Tendon Single-Bundle, Arthroscopic, Anatomic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Rectangular Bone Tunnels, Arthroscopy Techniques, 7, 10, pp. e1045-e1056, (2018); Grana, William A., An Analysis of Autograft Fixation After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in a Rabbit Model, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 344-351, (1994); Hantes, M.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tibial tunnel enlargement including the morphological change after anatomic ACL reconstruction with a bone–patellar tendon–bone (BTB) graft using 3D CT models. Methods: Eighteen patients with unilateral ACL rupture were included. The anatomic rectangular-tunnel (ART) ACL reconstruction with a BTB autograft was performed. 3D CT models of the tibia, the tibial tunnel, and the bone plug at 3 weeks and 1 year after surgery were reconstructed and superimposed using a surface registration technique. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the tibial tunnel perpendicular to the tunnel axis was evaluated at the aperture and 5, 10, and 15-mm distal from the aperture. The CSA was measured at 3 weeks and 1 year after surgery and compared between the two time points. The locations of the center and the anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral edges of the tunnel footprint were also evaluated based on the coordinate system for the tibial plateau and compared between the two time points. Results: At the aperture, the CSA of the tibial tunnel at 1 year after surgery was significantly larger by 21.9% than that at 3 weeks (P < 0.001). In contrast, the CSA at 1 year was significantly smaller than that at 3 weeks at 10 and 15-mm distal from the aperture (P = 0.041 and < 0.001, respectively). The center of the tunnel footprint significantly shifted postero-laterally with significant posterior shift of the anterior/posterior edges and lateral shift of the lateral edge (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The tibial tunnel enlarged at the aperture by 22% 1-year after anatomic ACL reconstruction with a BTB graft, and the tunnel morphology changed in a postero-lateral direction at the aperture and into conical shape inside the tunnel. © 2019 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association","","adolescent; adult; anatomic landmark; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone disease; bone length; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical article; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; female; human; joint laxity; male; postoperative complication; Tegner activity score; tendon; tibial plateau; tibial tunnel enlargement; diagnostic imaging; surgery; three-dimensional imaging; tibia; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafts; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Tibia; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","","","Discovery CT 750HD, General Electric","General Electric","","","Fahey, Mark, Bone Tunnel Enlargement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 410-414, (1994); Peyrache, M.

Methods: Sixty-one patients with a primary unilateral ACL injury were included. Tunnels were created inside the ACL attachment areas after carefully removing the ACL remnant and clearly identifying the bony landmarks. Using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3-D CT) images, the proportion of the tunnel apertures to the anatomical attachment areas was evaluated at 3 weeks. The clinical outcomes were evaluated at 2 years postoperatively. Results: Geographically, the 3-D CT evaluation showed the entire femoral tunnel aperture; at least 75% of the entire tibial tunnel aperture area was consistently located inside the anatomical attachment areas surrounded by the bony landmarks. In the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective assessment, all patients were classified as ‘normal’ or ‘nearly normal’. The Lachman test and pivot-shift test were negative in 98.4% and 95.1% of patients, respectively. The mean side-to-side difference of the anterior laxity at the maximum manual force with a KT- 1000 Knee Arthrometer was 0.2 ± 0.9 mm, with 95.1% of patients ranging from − 1 to + 2 mm. Conclusion: By identifying arthroscopic landmarks, the entire femoral tunnel aperture and at least 75% of the entire tibial tunnel aperture area were consistently located inside the anatomical attachment areas. With properly created tunnels inside the anatomical attachment areas, the ART ACLR using a BTB graft could provide satisfactory outcomes both subjectively and objectively in more than 95% of patients.

The best choice of graft for reconstruction remains undecided. This prospective, randomized clinical trial aimed to compare clinical results of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts and four-strand semitendinosus-gracilis (QHT) grafts for ACL reconstruction over a 1-year follow-up interval in Indian population. Methods: 42 consecutive patients with ACL injury were recruited, by pick and draw method and allotted into two groups with 21 patients in each group. Group A patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using BPTB graft while QHT autograft was used for patients in Group B. All the patients underwent standard ipsilateral arthroscopic ACL reconstruction procedure using a single incision, antero-medial (AM) portal technique for BPTB or the QHT autograft by a same surgeon. Patients were followed up regularly for a minimum period of 1 year. Results: After one year, the Cincinnati score was 91 ± 4.117 in BPTB group and 89.29 ± 5.371 in QHT group (P = 0.282). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the mean scores with respect to pain, overall activity level and running in the Cincinnati score. None of the patients complained of the knee giving way. Similarly, at 1 year, the Lysholm score was 92.84 ± 2.630 and 90.55 ± 2.395 in the two groups respectively (P = 0.842). There were no episodes of locking or instability and there was no significant difference in the mean Lysholm scores regarding pain and squatting. Conclusion: There was no significant functional difference between the two grafts in terms of Lysholm and the Cincinnati score, anterior knee laxity and altered sensation over proximal leg. The patients with QHT groups performed better than BPTB functionally at 6 month so early return to sport is possible even with QHT autograft. © 2018","ACL injury; ACL reconstruction; Comparison; Control; Hamstring graft; Patellar tendon graft; Randomised","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; Article; body position; bone patellar tendon bone graft; Cincinnati score; clinical article; controlled study; follow up; gracilis flap; human; Indian; intermethod comparison; knee instability; knee meniscus; knee meniscus rupture; knee pain; Lysholm score; musculoskeletal disease assessment; pain assessment; patellar ligament; postoperative pain; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; return to sport; running; semitendinous muscle; squatting","","","","","","","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Open Orthop J, (2013); Ferretti, Andrea, Osteoarthritis of the knee after ACL reconstruction, International Orthopaedics, 15, 4, pp. 367-371, (1991); Jörgensen, Uffe, Long-term follow-up of meniscectomy in athletes.

However, they are not frequently used for bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) grafting, mainly because it is uncertain whether an ALCFD enables sufficient integration of the bone plug. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate bone plug-socket integration in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) with an ALCFD. Methods: Twenty consecutive patients with a mean age of 25±10 years underwent primary anatomic rectangular tunnel (ART) ACL-R with a BTB graft using BTB TightRope. The operated knees were evaluated by CT at 4 weeks and 8 weeks postoperatively. Union between the bone plug and the socket wall were assessed on 30 evaluation planes. No border between the plug and the socket wall, or trabecular continuity, were defined as complete union and a visible gap of >1 mm as incomplete union. When complete union was observed on >20, 11-20, 5-10 or <5 of the evaluation planes, bone integration was graded as excellent, good, fair or poor, respectively. In addition, the interface area between the plug and the socket wall was assessed by CT value index. Clinical evaluation was performed at 2 years postoperatively using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form. Results: The proportion of patients with excellent bone integration was 20% at 4 weeks and 85% at 8 weeks, showing a significant difference (p=0.00015). Moreover, the CT value index of the interface area at 4 weeks was 25.8%±11.8% and that at 8 weeks was 15.3%±9.0%, again showing a significant difference (p=0.005). These suggest that bone integration of the interface area progresses over time and adequate at 8 weeks. Clinically, all 16 patients examined directly were rated their knees as normal or nearly normal with a mean side-to-side difference in anterior laxity at manual maximum force by KT-2000 of 0.2±0.3 mm. Conclusion: Excellent bone plug-socket integration was observed at 8 weeks after ART ACL-R using an ALCFD with satisfactory clinical results. An ALCFD could be safely applied for ART ACL-R. © 2019 International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine.","acl / pcl; bone; Ct-scan; knee","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; female; human; male; multidetector computed tomography; patellar ligament; postoperative period; priority journal","","","Aquatius NET Viewer, TeraRecon; Aquilion 16, Toshiba Medical Systems; BTB TightRope, Arthrex; Director Drill Guide System, Smith and Nephew Endoscopy; Fiber Wires, Arthrex; KT-2000, Medmetric","TeraRecon; Toshiba Medical Systems; Arthrex; Smith and Nephew Endoscopy; Arthrex; Medmetric","","","Beynnon, Bruce D., Treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, Part 2, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 11, pp. 1751-1767, (2005); Brand, Jeff C., Graft fixation in cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 5, pp. 761-774, (2000); Kurosaka, Masahiro, A biomechanical comparison of different surgical techniques of graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 225-229, (1987); Choi, Nam-hong, Clinical and Radiological Outcomes after Hamstring Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructions: Comparison between Fixed-Loop and Adjustable-Loop Cortical Suspension Devices, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 45, 4, pp. 826-831, (2017); Mae, Tatsuo, Optimization of graft fixation at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Part I: Effect of initial tension, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 36, 6, pp. 1087-1093, (2008); Shino, Konsei, Graft fixation with predetermined tension using a new device, the Double Spike Plate, Arthroscopy, 18, 8, pp. 908-911, (2002); Cohen, Jacob, A power primer, Psychological Bulletin, 112, 1, pp. 155-159, (1992); Shino, Konsei, Anatomic ACL reconstruction: rectangular tunnel/bone–patellar tendon–bone or triple-bundle/semitendinosus tendon grafting, Journal of Orthopaedic Science, 20, 3, pp. 457-468, (2015); Shino, Konsei, Rectangular Tunnel Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft to Mimic Natural Fiber Arrangement, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 24, 10, pp. 1178-1183, (2008); Shino, Konsei, Anatomically oriented anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft via rectangular socket and tunnel: A snug-fit and impingement-free grafting technique, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 21, 11, pp. 1402-1402.e5, (2005)","R.

The purpose of the study was to compare clinical outcomes between groups of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft divided according to amount of ACL remnant and investigate effect of remnant preservation on outcomes of ACL reconstruction. A total of 185 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with BPTB autograft were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups according to proportion of length of remnant tissue of injured ACL covering part of reconstructed ACL to total length of reconstructed ACL: group A included 83 patients with no remnant, group B consisted of 38 patients with remnant of < 1/3, group C consisted of 35 patients with remnant of 1/3 to2/3, and group D consisted of 29 patients with remnant of > 2/3. Primary outcome was International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score. Secondary outcomes were stability, range of motion, patient-reported outcomes determined by Lysholm knee scoring scale and Tegner activity scale, IKDC objective grade, and single hop for distance. Return to activity and near-return to activity were investigated. A minimum follow-up duration was 24 months. There was no statistically significant difference between four groups regarding postoperative anterior translation (p = 0.731), Lysholm knee score (p = 0.599), IKDC objective grade (p > 0.999), hop test (p = 0.878), and near-return to activity (p = 0.193). However, patients of group D had significantly better outcomes in IKDC subjective score (group A = 85.0 ± 5.9, group B = 84.9 ± 8.1, group C = 87.4 ± 6.4, group D = 89.2 ± 8.1, p = 0.017), Tegner activity scale (group A = 5.0 ± 1.1, group B = 5.2 ± 1.0, group C = 5.7 ± 1.3, group D = 5.9 ± 1.0, p = 0.001), and return to activity (group A = 25.3%, group B = 31.6%, group C = 45.7%, group D = 55.2%, p = 0.014). ACL reconstruction using BPTB autograft with remnant preservation did not provide better anterior stability compared with conventional ACL reconstruction. However, preservation of remnant of > 2/3 led to more improved activity-related clinical outcomes than no remnant preservation. In cases with substantial remnant tissue of injured ACL remaining, reconstruction of ACL while preserving as much remnant tissue as possible is recommended.

Methods: This study included 24 patients with unilateral ACL rupture. Twelve patients underwent anatomic rectangular tunnel (ART) ACL reconstruction with BTB graft and the remaining 12 underwent anatomic triple-bundle (ATB) ACL reconstruction with HST graft. Three-dimensional computer models of femur and bone tunnels were reconstructed from computed tomography images obtained at 3 weeks and 1 year postoperatively. The femoral tunnel enlargement from 3 weeks to 1 year was evaluated by comparing the cross-sectional area (CSA), and compared between the two groups. Results: The CSA in the ART group at 1 year decreased at the aperture as well as inside the tunnel comparing that at 3 weeks. The CSAs of both tunnels in the ATB group at 1 year significantly increased at the aperture in comparison to those at 3 weeks, and gradually decreased toward the inside of the tunnel. The enlargement rate at the aperture in the ART group was −12.9%, which was significantly smaller than that of anteromedial graft (27.9%; P = 0.006) and posterolateral graft (31.3%; P = 0.003) in the ATB group. The tunnel enlargement rate at 5 mm from the aperture in the ART group was also significantly smaller than that in the ATB group. At 10 mm from the aperture, there was no significant difference between the tunnel enlargement rate in the ART group and that of anteromedial tunnel. Conclusions: The tunnel enlargement rate around the aperture was significantly smaller after the ART procedure than that after the ATB procedure. Thus, BTB graft might be preferable as a graft material to HST graft in the femoral tunnel enlargement. © 2018 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; Article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; computer model; controlled study; female; hamstring tendon graft; human; male; postoperative period; prospective study; adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthroplasty; femur; hamstring tendon; procedures; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroplasty; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Female; Femur; Hamstring Tendons; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Sadoghi, Patrick, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A clinical comparison of bone-patellar tendon-bone single bundle versus semitendinosus and gracilis double bundle technique, International Orthopaedics, 35, 1, pp. 127-133, (2011); Sasaki, Shizuka, Prospective Randomized Study of Objective and Subjective Clinical Results between Double-Bundle and Single-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 44, 4, pp. 855-864, (2016); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); Hoeher, Jürgen, Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Fact or fiction?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 4, pp. 231-240, (1998); Jagodzinski, Michael, Analysis of forces of ACL reconstructions at the tunnel entrance: Is tunnel enlargement a biomechanical problem?, Journal of Biomechanics, 38, 1, pp. 23-31, (2005); Xu, Yan, Relation of tunnel enlargement and tunnel placement after single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 27, 7, pp. 923-932, (2011); Choi, Nam-hong, Femoral tunnel widening after hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bioabsorbable transfix, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, 2, pp. 383-387, (2012); Hantes, M.

Recently semitendinosus and gracilis tendons graft have been used increasingly. We hypothetise that the Bone-Patella Tendon-Bone graft is a good and economical graft for the Indian population with no adverse effects of anterior knee pain or patellar tendon shortening. We believe that the early squatting and cross-legged sitting causes early and constant stretching of the tendon in our patients. This is responsible for the lesser incidences of adverse effects in the Indian population. Material and Method: In a retrospective study, the hospital database was scrutinized to shortlist patients who had undergone a bone-patella tendon-bone harvest for ACL or PCL reconstruction before 2013. Each patient was evaluated using the Lysholm score and the KOOS Score. VAS was also used, to evaluate for the amount of pain experienced by patients. The analysis of the quadriceps power along with the presence or absence of any extensor lag was made too. The modified Insall Salvati index was also calculated. Results: Forty-seven patients were shortlisted of which 25 patients were followed up with an average follow up of 94.5 months. Although some patients did complain of occasional pain with the average VAS score of 1.45; on analyzing the data it was evident that all our patients had excellent quadriceps power (5/5) with no extensor lag. The mean Lysholm score was 95.55, while the mean KOOS score was 94.17. The mean Insall index of 1.05 showed no significant patella baja in any of our patients. Conclusion: It is ascertained that no significant retro-patellar pain or shortening of the patellar tendon occurs following a bone patella tendon bone harvest. The bone patella bone tendon graft is a suitable graft for ligament reconstruction with good functional outcome, and no significant adverse effect of patella baja or anterior knee pain in the Indian patients.

Lindner College of Business, Cincinnati, OH, United States","Background: The effect of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on restoring normal knee kinematics in unstable knees with physiologic laxity of secondary ligamentous restraints remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the stabilizing function of an ACL reconstruction and the resulting ACL graft forces in knees with severely abnormal anterior subluxation due to associated laxity of secondary restraints. Methods: A 6-degree-of-freedom robotic simulator was used to test 21 cadaveric knees studied as a whole and in subgroups of lax secondary restraints (Lax-SR) and intact secondary restraints (Intact-SR), based on abnormal translations and tibial rotations. Native, ACL-sectioned, and ACL-reconstructed conditions were tested. An instrumented bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft measured ACL graft forces. The loading profile involved the Lachman test (25° of flexion and 100-N anterior load), anterior tibial loading (100-N anterior load across 10° to 90° of flexion), internal rotation (25° of flexion and 5-Nm torque), and 2 pivot-shift simulations (100-N anterior load, 7-Nm valgus, and either 5 Nm of internal rotation [Pivot Shift 1] or 1 Nm of internal rotation [Pivot Shift 2]). Equivalence between conditions was defined as being within 2 mm for compartment translation and within 2° for internal tibial rotation, with p < 0.05. Results: ACL sectioning increased center translation in the Lachman test by a mean of 10.9 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.3 to 12.5 mm; p = 0.99), which was equivalent to native values after ACL reconstruction in all knees (mean difference, 0.0 mm [95% CI, 20.4 to 0.4 mm]; p = 0.0013), and in subgroups of Lax-SR (mean difference, 0.2 mm [95% CI, 20.5 to 0.8 mm]; p = 0.03) and Intact-SR (mean difference, 20.2 mm [95% CI,-0.8 to 0.4 mm]; p = 0.002). ACL sectioning in the pivot-shift (5-Nm) test increased lateral compartment translation to non-native-equivalent levels, which were restored to native-equivalent values after ACL reconstruction in all knees (mean difference, 0.9 mm [95% CI, 0.4 to 1.4 mm]; p = 0.055), in the Intact-SR subgroup (mean difference, 1.1 mm [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.8 mm]; p = 0.03), and to nearly native-equivalence in the Lax-SR subgroup (mean difference, 0.6 mm [95% CI, 20.3 to 1.6 mm; p = 0.06). The highest ACL graft force reached a mean of 190.9 N in the pivot-shift (5-Nm) test. Conclusions: The ACL reconstruction restored native kinematics and native rotational stability in all knees, including knees having laxity of secondary ligamentous restraints and clinically equivalent Grade-3 pivot-shift subluxation, and did so at ACL graft forces that were not excessive. Clinical Relevance: An ACL reconstruction with a BPTB graft restored normal stability parameters regardless of the integrity of secondary ligamentous restraints. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

METHODS Single-bundle ACL reconstruction with BTB autograft was performed on 50 patients with a mean age of 28 years using the trans-tibial (TT) (n = 20) and trans-portal (TP) (n = 30) techniques. Femoral and tibial tunnel positions were identified from the high-resolution 3D-CT bone models two weeks after surgery. Anterolateral rotatory translation was examined using a Slocum anterolateral rotatory instability test in open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1.0-1.5 years after surgery, by measuring anterior tibial translation at the medial and lateral compartments on its sagittal images. Anterior-posterior stability was evaluated with a Kneelax3 arthrometer. RESULTS A total of 40 patients (80%) were finally followed up. Femoral tunnel positions were shallower (P < 0.01) and higher (P < 0.001), and tibial tunnel positions were more posterior (P <0.05) in the TT group compared with the TP group. Anterolateral rotatory translations in reconstructed knees were significantly correlated with the shallow femoral tunnel positions (R = 0.42, P < 0.01), and the rotatory translations were greater in the TT group (3.2 ± 1.6 mm) than in the TP group (2.0 ± 1.8 mm) (P < 0.05). Side-to-side differences of Kneelax3 arthrometer were 1.5 ± 1.3 mm in the TT, and 1.7 ± 1.6 mm in the TP group (N.S.). Lysholm scores, KOOS subscales and reinjury rate showed no difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION Anterolateral rotatory instability significantly correlated shallow femoral tunnel positions after ACL reconstruction using BTB autografts. Clinical outcomes, rotatory and anterior-posterior stability were overall satisfactory in both techniques, but the TT technique located femoral tunnels in shallower and higher positions, and tibial tunnels in more posterior positions than the TP technique, thus increased the anterolateral rotation. Anatomic ACL reconstruction with BTB autografts may restore knee function and stability. © The Author(s) 2017.","Anatomic; Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone-patellar tendon-bone; Magnetic resonance imaging; Patellar tendon; Rotatory instability; Singlebundle; Tunnel position","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","Supported by JSPS Fellowships for Research Abroad, No. H27787; and International Research Fund for Subsidy of Kyushu University School of Medicine Alumni.","Kondo, Eiji, Biomechanical comparison of anatomic double-bundle, anatomic single-bundle, and nonanatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 39, 2, pp. 279-288, (2011); Zantop, Thore, Anatomical and nonanatomical double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Importance of femoral tunnel location on knee kinematics, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 36, 4, pp. 678-685, (2008); Forsythe, Brian, The location of femoral and tibial tunnels in anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction analyzed by three-dimensional computed tomography models, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 92, 6, pp. 1418-1426, (2010); Rayan, Faizal, Review of evolution of tunnel position in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, World Journal of Orthopedics, 6, 2, pp. 252-262, (2015); Loh, John C., Knee stability and graft function following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Comparison between 11 o'clock and 10 o'clock femoral tunnel placement, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 19, 3, pp. 297-304, (2003); Suzuki, Tomoyuki, Biomechanical comparison between the rectangular-tunnel and the round-tunnel anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction procedures with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 30, 10, pp. 1294-1302, (2014); Abebe, Ermias Shawel, The effect of femoral tunnel placement on ACL graft orientation and length during in vivo knee flexion, Journal of Biomechanics, 44, 10, pp. 1914-1920, (2011); Bedi, Asheesh, Transtibial versus anteromedial portal reaming in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: An anatomic and biomechanical evaluation of surgical technique, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 27, 3, pp. 380-e41, (2011); Wang, Hongsheng, Transtibial versus anteromedial portal technique in single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Outcomes of knee joint kinematics during walking, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 41, 8, pp. 1847-1856, (2013); Shen, Wei, Application of the anatomic double-bundle reconstruction concept to revision and augmentation anterior cruciate ligament surgeries, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 90, SUPPL. 4, pp. 20-34, (2008)","Y.

Methods A total of 226 consecutive patients presenting with acute ACL tears were prospectively evaluated for generalized hypermobility by a modified Beighton criteria. Minimum 2-year follow-up was achieved for 183 knees (81%). Patients underwent ACLR with either bone–patellar–tendon (BPTB) autograft (n = 46), quadrupled hamstring (HT) autograft (n = 85), or allograft tissue (n = 52). KT-1000 measurements, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Cincinnati, and Lysholm scores were obtained. Results Forty-one of 183 consecutive patients were categorized as hypermobile. At mean 6 years' follow-up (range 2-12.5 years), IKDC (P =.003), Cincinnati (P =.001), and Lysholm scores (P <.001) were significantly better in the Non-Hypermobile group for patients with an intact graft. The failure rate was higher in the Hypermobile group (10 knees, 24.4% failure rate) compared with the Nonhypermobile group (11 knees, 7.7% failure rate) (P =.006). The overall ACL injury rate (ACL graft injury, excessive graft laxity, plus contralateral ACL tear) was higher in the Hypermobile group (34.1%) compared with the Nonhypermobile group (12.0%) (P =.002). Heel height >5 cm (P =.009) and fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) extension >90° (P =.006) were independently predictive of failure for the entire study population. Conclusions Graft failure rates were higher and inferior subjective outcomes were observed after ACLR in patients with generalized hypermobility. Heel height and fifth MCP hyperextension were most predictive of ACL injury/reinjury and poorer outcome scores. Nearly one-third of hypermobile patients sustained a contralateral ACL tear, ipsilateral graft failure, or had excessive graft laxity.

Overall, 19 patients agreed prospectively to undergo regular morphological and histological examinations of the B-TCP-grafted site. Postoperative radiographic, ultrasonographic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed to evaluate the grafted site at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Postoperative knee function and donor-site morbidity were assessed at 12 months using the kneeling test. A histological examination was also performed at this time Radiographic examination and MRI showed that the grafted B-TCP was completely absorbed and remodeled into normal bone structure in the tibia and patella at 6 months postoperatively. Histological and ultrasonographic examinations of all subjects showed that the grafted B-TCP was substituted by normal bone tissue, and the patellar tendon - bone junction had regenerated at 12 months postoperatively. Clinical functional knee tests showed good recovery of the donor site. All patients could perform kneeling and knee walking on hard ground. The results of this pilot study suggest that grafting B-TCP into the BPTB-harvesting site promotes the remodeling process of the bone and patellar tendon structures.

We hypothesized that a relationship exists between geometry of the knees extensor mechanism and the risk of sustaining a non-contact ACL injury. Geometry of the extensor mechanism was characterized using MRI scans of the knees of 88 subjects that suffered their first non-contact ACL injury and 88 matched control subjects with normal knees that were on the same team. The orientation of the patellar tendon axis was measured relative to the femoral flexion–extension axis to determine the extensor moment arm (EMA), and relative to tibial long axis to measure coronal patellar tendon angle (CPTA) and sagittal patellar tendon angle (SPTA). Associations between these parameters and ACL injury risk were tested with and without adjustment for flexion and internal rotation position of the tibia relative to the femur during MRI data acquisition. After adjustment for internal rotation position of the tibia relative to the femur there were no associations between EMA, CPTA, and SPTA and risk of suffering an ACL injury. However, increased internal rotation position of the tibia relative to the femur was significantly associated with increased risk of ACL injury in female athletes both in univariate analysis (Odds Ratio = 1.16 per degree of internal rotation of the tibia, p = 0.002), as well as after adjustment for EMA, CPTA, and SPTA.: © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Purpose: First, to determine the rotational stability and ACL graft forces provided by an anatomic bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction in the ACL-deficient knee alone and with an associated ALL/iliotibial band (ITB) injury. Second, to determine the added rotational stabilizing effect and reduction in ACL graft forces provided by an ALL reconstruction. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A 6 degrees of freedom robotic simulator was used to test 7 fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens during 5 testing conditions: intact, ACL-sectioned, ACL-reconstructed, ALL/ITB-sectioned, and ALL-reconstructed. Lateral and medial tibiofemoral compartment translations and internal tibial rotations were measured under Lachman test conditions, 5-N·m internal rotation, and 2 pivot-shift simulations. Statistical equivalence within 2 mm and 2° was defined as P <.05. Results: Single-graft ACL reconstruction restored central tibial translation under Lachman testing and internal rotation under 5-N·m internal rotation torque (P <.05). A modest increase in internal rotation under 5-N·m internal rotation torque occurred after ALL/ITB sectioning of 5.1° (95% CI, 3.6° to 6.7°) and 6.7° (95% CI, 4.3° to 9.1°) at 60° and 90° of flexion, respectively (P =.99). Lateral compartment translation increases in the pivot-shift tests were <2 mm. ALL reconstruction restored internal rotation within 0.5° (95% CI, -1.9° to 2.9°) and 0.7° (95% CI, -2.0° to 3.4°) of the ACL-reconstructed state at 60° and 90° of flexion, respectively (P <.05). The ALL procedure reduced ACL graft forces, at most, 75 N in the pivot-shift tests and 81 N in the internal rotation tests. Conclusion: Although the ALL reconstruction corrected the small abnormal changes in the internal rotation limit at high flexion angles, the procedure had no effect in limiting tibiofemoral compartment translations in the pivot-shift test and produced only modest decreases in ACL graft forces. Accordingly, the recommendation to perform an ALL reconstruction to correct pivot-shift abnormalities is questioned. Clinical Relevance: The small changes in rotational stability after ALL/ITB sectioning would not seem to warrant the routine addition of an ALL reconstruction in primary ACL injuries. Clinical exceptions may exist, as in grossly unstable grade 3 pivot-shift knees and revision knees. However, the concern exists of overconstraining normal tibial rotations. © 2017 The Author(s).","ACL reconstruction; ALL reconstruction; pivot-shift; tibiofemoral compartment translations","anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; biomechanics; cadaver; human; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; middle aged; procedures; robotics; rotation; tibia; torque; transplantation; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cadaver; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Robotics; Rotation; Tibia; Torque; Transplants","","","","","","","Bignozzi, Simone, Does a lateral plasty control coupled translation during antero-posterior stress in single-bundle ACL reconstruction?

Purpose: To assess the effect of NSAID administration on patients undergoing ACLR. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Included patients were aged >15 years and were registered in the Norwegian Knee Ligament Registry from 2008 until 2013 after the primary ACLR. Patients with insufficient data regarding administration of NSAIDs and those with associated knee ligament injuries requiring surgical treatment were excluded from this study. Graft survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and hazard ratios (HRs) for revision were evaluated using Cox regression analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for a Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)-quality of life (QOL) subscale score <44 at 2-year follow-up. Results: A total of 7822 patients were included in the analysis for graft survival and assessment for risk of revision. Of these, 4144 patients were administered NSAIDs postoperatively. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.8 years (range, 0-5.9 years). Administration of NSAIDs did not influence graft survival (P =.568). Adjusted Cox regression analyses demonstrated the same finding regarding risk of revision (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3). ACLR using a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft showed a reduced risk of revision (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8) among patients administered NSAIDs. In subgroup analyses of 3144 patients, administration of NSAIDs demonstrated a beneficial effect on the risk of a KOOS-QOL score <44 at 2-year follow-up (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9). Conclusion: Administration of NSAIDs to patients after ACLR does not have a negative effect on graft survival, risk of revision, or risk of a KOOS-QOL score <44 at 2-year follow-up. We emphasize using caution when administering NSAIDs by keeping the duration and dosage of NSAIDs as short and low as possible to ensure sufficient pain relief while limiting unwanted exposure to any known and unknown adverse effects of these drugs. © 2016 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction revision; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug","nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; cohort analysis; female; human; Kaplan Meier method; knee; Knee Injuries; male; Norway; Osteoarthritis, Knee; proportional hazards model; quality of life; register; risk; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Knee Joint; Male; Proportional Hazards Models; Quality of Life; Registries; Risk; Young Adult","","Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal","","","","","Almekinders, Louis C., An In Vitro Investigation Into the Effects of Repetitive Motion and Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Medication on Human Tendon Fibroblasts, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 119-123, (1995); Arthursson, Astvaldur J., Validation of data in the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register and the Norwegian Patient Register: 5,134 Primary total hip arthroplasties and revisions operated at a single hospital between 1987 and 2003, Acta Orthopaedica, 76, 6, pp. 823-828, (2005); Barrett, Austin M., Anterior cruciate ligament graft failure: A comparison of graft type based on age and tegner activity level, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 39, 10, pp. 2194-2198, (2011); Bhandari, Mohit, Predictors of reoperation following operative management of fractures of the tibial shaft, Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, 17, 5, pp. 353-361, (2003); Blomquist, Jesper, Do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs affect the outcome of arthroscopic Bankart repair?, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 24, 6, pp. e510-514, (2014); Breivik, Harald Petter, Postoperative pain management: Why is it difficult to show that it improves outcome?, European Journal of Anaesthesiology, 15, 6, pp. 748-751, (1998); Breivik, Harald Petter, The future role of the anaesthesiologist in pain management, Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica, 49, 7, pp. 922-926, (2005); Breivik, Harald Petter, Management of acute postoperative pain: Still a long way to go!, Pain, 137, 2, pp. 233-234, (2008); Burd, Timothy A., Heterotopic ossification prophylaxis with indomethacin increases the risk of long-bone nonunion, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 85, 5, pp. 700-705, (2003); Busti, Anthony J., Effects of perioperative antiinflammatory and immunomodulating therapy on surgical wound healing, Pharmacotherapy, 25, 11 I, pp. 1566-1591, (2005)","E.

A standardized surgical technique was used for each graft type. Intra-op arthroscopy findings and drilled tunnel diameters were noted. They were followed up for 3 and 6 months. Radiological assessment was done at 3 and 6 months with clinical score assessment at 6 months. Results: At 6 months, clinical scores were comparable in both groups. Tunnel widening in both femoral and tibial tunnel at 3 and 6 months were significantly higher in STG group (p values <0.05). The rate of widening was higher in 0–3 months and reduced in 3–6 months. There was statistically significant negative correlation between femoral tunnel widening by CT and IKDC score at 6 months (p value 0.049). We found a positive correlation between posterior positioning of femoral tunnel and Lysholm and IKDC scores. The correlation with Lysholm scores was statistically significant (p value 0.046). Conclusion: To conclude, tunnel widening is more with hamstrings graft. Femoral tunnel widening has significant negative correlation with that of IKDC scores at 6 months.

However, donor site patellar tendon strain ratio—reflecting structural features—has not been studied with US elastography. Here, we ascertain real-time elastography properties of patellar tendon donor site and clinical relevance of these properties in patients with auto-graft BTB ACL reconstruction in the postoperative period. Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using BTB autograft were evaluated. Demographic, operative and clinical data (severity of pain, Lysholm Knee score, sit to stand test, packages/year for smoking amount) were noted. Patellar tendons of the operated knees were evaluated by ultrasound (length and thickness) and sonoelastography (strain ratio). The healthy knees of the patients constituted the control group. Results: Eighteen patients (17 M, 1 F; mean age 30.9 ± 7 years) were evaluated. Mean postoperative follow-up period was 22.1 ± 2.6 (range 18–26) months. Patellar tendons were shorter and thicker on the operated side when compared with the contralateral side (both p = 0.001). Patellar tendon strain ratios of the operated side were lower than the contralateral side (harder tendon on operated side). While there was no correlation between strain ratios and clinical variables (age, BMI, postoperative time, severity of pain, Lysholm score, all p values > 0.05), significant negative correlations were detected between strain ratios of proximal, middle and distal thirds of operated side and amount of smoking (p = 0.008, r = −0.607, p = 0.009, r = −0.598, p = 0.023, r = −0.533, respectively). Conclusion: Patellar tendons on the operated sides seemed to thicken and shorten with decreased strain ratios at the donor side compared to the healthy side at an average of 2-year follow-up in patients with ACL reconstruction using BTB autograft, and amount of smoking had negative relationship with strain ratio of donor patellar tendon. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Elastography; Patellar tendon; Strain ratio; Ultrasound","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; body mass; bone graft; clinical article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; demography; disease association; elastography; female; follow up; human; Lysholm score; male; operation duration; pain severity; patellar ligament; postoperative period; priority journal; real time elastography; tendon graft; adverse effects; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; diagnostic imaging; smoking; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Patellar Ligament; Smoking; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","Brown, Jr Jeffrey, Revision anterior cruciate ligament surgery, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 18, 1, pp. 109-171, (1999); Kannus, Pekka A., Conservatively treated tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.

METHODS: Retrospective data were collected on: preoperative, postoperative and follow-up tibial plateau angles, plateau segment rotation, tibial tuberosity width and length of the cranial aspect of tibial tuberosity segment from the patellar tendon insertion and rotation of the tibial plateau below the level of the insertion of the patellar ligament. RESULTS: In 26 small dogs (29 stifles in total), mean preoperative, postoperative and follow-up tibial plateau angles were 38·2°, 4·8°, and 4·4°, respectively. Documented postoperative complications were limited to patellar tendinopathy in a single case (3·4%) and tibial tuberosity or fibula fracture were not observed. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Short-term radiographic and clinical outcome of tibial plateau levelling osteotomy stabilised with anatomically contoured six-hole locking compression plates for the treatment of small dogs with large tibial plateau angle suggests a very low risk of complications. Rotation beyond the ""safe point"" is necessary to perform full rotation in some cases, but does not appear to incur an increased risk of tibial tuberosity fracture. © 2016 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.","","abnormalities; adverse effects; animal; anterior cruciate ligament; body size; bone plate; diagnostic imaging; dog; female; male; osteotomy; postoperative complication; procedures; radiography; retrospective study; Rupture, Spontaneous; tibia; veterinary; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Body Size; Bone Plates; Dogs; Female; Male; Osteotomy; Postoperative Complications; Radiography; Retrospective Studies; Tibia","","","","","","","Addison, Elena S., Evaluation of Osteotomy Accuracy and Rotational and Angular Alignment for Cranial Closing Wedge Ostectomy Performed With and Without Alignment Aids, Veterinary Surgery, 44, 1, pp. 78-84, (2015); Apelt, Detlef, Effect of Cranial Tibial Closing Wedge Angle on Tibial Subluxation: An Ex Vivo Study, Veterinary Surgery, 39, 4, pp. 454-459, (2010); Bergh, Mary Sarah, Risk factors for tibial tuberosity fracture after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy in dogs, Veterinary Surgery, 37, 4, pp. 374-382, (2008); Blake, Cara A., Single cycle to failure in bending of three standard and five locking plates and plate constructs, Veterinary and Comparative Orthopaedics and Traumatology, 24, 6, pp. 408-417, (2011); Cabassu, Julien B., Single cycle to failure in torsion of three standard and five locking plate constructs, Veterinary and Comparative Orthopaedics and Traumatology, 24, 6, pp. 418-425, (2011); Caylor, Kevin B., Intra-and interobserver measurement variability of Tibial plateau slope from lateral radiographs in dogs, Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association, 37, 3, pp. 263-268, (2001); Conkling, Amanda L., Comparison of Tibial Plateau Angle Changes after Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy Fixation with Conventional or Locking Screw Technology, Veterinary Surgery, 39, 4, pp. 475-481, (2010); Duerr, Felix Michael, Comparison of surgical treatment options for cranial cruciate ligament disease in large-breed dogs with excessive tibial plateau angle, Veterinary Surgery, 37, 1, pp. 49-62, (2008); Fettig, Arthur A., Observer Variability of Tibial Plateau Slope Measurement in 40 Dogs with Cranial Cruciate Ligament-Deficient Stifle Joints, Veterinary Surgery, 32, 5, pp. 471-478, (2003); Fox, Derek B., Principles of uniapical and biapical radial deformity correction using dome osteotomies and the center of rotation of angulation methodology in dogs, Veterinary Surgery, 35, 1, pp. 67-77, (2006)","D.C.

Hypothesis: Patients with a high degree of hyperextension will have a higher rate of graft tear/failure and lower subjective scores after surgery compared with patients with less knee extension. Study Design: Cohort study, Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Of 2329 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft between 1998 and 2008, there were 625 patients who met the inclusion criteria of having primary ACL surgery, no bilateral ACL injuries, no existing osteoarthritis, and having either ≥6° of knee hyperextension before and after surgery (group A: n = 318; mean hyperextension, 8° ± 2° [range, 6°-15°]) or ≤3° of knee hyperextension before and after surgery (group B: n = 307; mean hyperextension, 0° ± 3° [range, 3° hyperextension to -4° short of 0° neutral]). KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum difference between knees, range of motion measurements, and subjective follow-up with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Cincinnati Knee Ratings Scale (CKRS) surveys were used to evaluate results. Subsequent graft tear related to specific injury within 5 years of surgery was recorded. Graft failure was defined as a KT-1000 manual maximum difference of >5 mm. Results: Follow-up was obtained from 278 (87%) in group A and 275 (90%) in group B at a mean of 4.1 ± 1.1 years after surgery. The KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum difference between knees was 2.0 ± 1.4 in group A and 2.1 ± 1.6 in group B (P =.701). Subsequent ACL graft tear/failure occurred in 22 patients (6.9%) in group A and 30 patients (9.8%) in group B (P =.246). Further subanalysis showed that the graft tear/failure rate was 6 of 81 (7.4%) for patients with ≥10° of hyperextension versus 16 of 237 (6.8%) for patients with 6° to 9° of hyperextension. There was no difference in IKDC or CKRS scores between groups after surgery (P =.933 and.155, respectively). Conclusion: Obtaining full hyperextension that is anatomically normal for most patients does not affect objective stability, ACL graft tear/failure rates, or subjective scores after ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft. © 2016 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Follow-up Studies; range of motion; rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthrometry; autograft; cohort analysis; female; follow up; graft survival; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; patellar ligament; physiology; transplantation; young adult; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthrometry, Articular; Autografts; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Graft Survival; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Patellar Ligament; Range of Motion, Articular; Young Adult","","","","","","","2000 International Knee Documentation Committee Knee Evaluation Form; Arendt, Elizabeth Anne, Knee Injury Patterns Among Men and Women in Collegiate Basketball and Soccer: NCAA Data and Review of Literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 694-701, (1995); Barber-Westin, Sue D., Rigorous statistical reliability, validity, and responsiveness testing of the cincinnati knee rating system in 350 subjects with uninjured, injured, or anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knees, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 4, pp. 402-416, (1999); de Carlo, Mark S., Normative data for range of motion and single-leg hop in high school athletes, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 6, 3, pp. 246-255, (1997); Hardin, James Allen, The effects of 'decelerated' rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on a hyperelastic female adolescent: A case study, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 26, 1, pp. 29-34, (1997); Irrgang, James J., Development and validation of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 5, pp. 600-613, (2001); Jagodzinski, Michael, Impingement pressure and tension forces of the anterior cruciate ligament, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 11, 2, pp. 85-90, (2003); Kim, Sungjae, Does severity or specific joint laxity influence clinical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 468, 4, pp. 1136-1141, (2010); Mayr, Hermann Otto, Rehabilitation results following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a hard brace compared to a fluid-filled soft brace, Knee, 17, 2, pp. 119-126, (2010); Mikkelsen, Christina, Can a post-operative brace in slight hyperextension prevent extension deficit after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?

Methods A study of the in vivo biologic behavior of an SR-PL(96)/D(4)LA/β-TCP biocomposite interference screw was initiated in 2011 using an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction model. Eight patients undergoing a bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction fixed at both the femur and tibia with an SR-PL(96)/D(4)LA/β-TCP screw at least 36 months earlier were evaluated by physical, radiographic, and computed tomography (CT) evaluations. Lysholm, Tegner, Cincinnati, and International Knee Documentation Committee scores were obtained. After incomplete degradation was observed in these 8 patients, a subsequent series of 17 patients were evaluated at a minimum of 48 months after surgery. By use of CT scans, Hounsfield unit (HU) data were obtained at the femoral and tibial screw and other bone sites. An ossification quality score (range, 1 to 4) was used to determine osteoconductivity at the screw sites. Results Eleven male and 6 female patients evaluated by CT scan and radiographs at a mean of 50 months (range, 48 to 61 months) after surgery showed bone plug healing to the tunnel wall and the SR-PL(96)/D(4)LA/β-TCP screws were replaced with material that was calcified and non-trabecular. Osteoconductivity was present in 24 of 34 tunnels (70.58%) and nearly complete or complete (type 3 or 4 ossification) in 11 of 34 (32.35%). Mean screw site densities (femoral, 242 HU; tibial, 240 HU) were consistent with cancellous bone density. One positive pivot-shift test was found. Lysholm, Cincinnati, Tegner, and International Knee Documentation Committee activity scores improved from 44.5, 40.7, 2.3, and 1.4, respectively, preoperatively to 92, 92.4, 5.7, and 3.3, respectively, at follow-up (P <.0001). The average postoperative Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score was 92. The mean KT arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) difference was 1.25 mm. Conclusions The SR-PL(96)/D(4)LA/β-TCP interference screw was replaced with calcified, non-trabecular material 4 years after implantation in a bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction model. Osteoconductivity was confirmed in 24 of 34 screw sites (71%), with nearly complete or complete filling in 11 of 34 (33%). The SR-PL(96)/D(4)LA/β-TCP biocomposite interference screw is osteoconductive.

Methods: thirty patients (24 men and 6 women) who underwent ACL reconstruction performed using an autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft were studied at a mean follow-up of 18 months. Clinical outcome was assessed on the basis of the Lysholm score, tegner activity level, international Knee Documentation Committee (iKDC) subjective form and the short Form-36. Clinical outcomes were correlated with both femoral and tibial tunnel placement measured on standard anteroposterior and lateral knee radiographs, in accordance with established guidelines. Results: tibial tunnel position on the lateral view correlated significantly with both the iKDC subjective form (r = -0.72; p<0.05) and the Lysholm score (r=-0.73; p<0.05). tibial tunnel position on the lateral view also correlated with stability measured using a Kt-1000 arthrometer at 30n of force (r=0.57; p<0.05). no correlation was found between α angle and anteroposterior (AP) laxity measured by Kt-1000 arthrometer. no significant correlation was found between femoral tunnel position (on either view) and Lysholm score, iKDC score and tegner activity level. similarly, no correlation was found between AP laxity measured by Kt-1000 arthrometer and femoral tunnel position. Conclusions: these results suggest that the more anterior the placement of the tibial tunnel, the better the clinical outcome will be. on the basis of literature data and our findings, we discuss the hypothesis that there exists a “correct area” for tunnel placement, making it possible to obtain the best results.

We previously reported on a cohort of anterior cruciate ligament deficient patients (n = 46) who had undergone surgery, but no difference was found in implant survivorship at a mean 5-year follow-up. The purpose of this study was to examine the kinematic behaviour of a subcohort of these patients. Methods The kinematic behaviour of anterior cruciate deficient knees (n = 16) after mobile unicompartmental knee replacement was compared to matched intact knees (n = 16). Sagittal plane knee fluoroscopy was taken while patients performed step-up and forward lunge exercises. The patellar tendon angle, knee flexion angle and implant position was calculated for each video frame. Findings The patellar tendon angle was 5° lower in the deficient group, indicating greater anterior tibial translation compared to the intact group between 30 and 40° of flexion. Large variability, particularly from 40-60° of flexion, was observed in the bearing position of the deficient group, which may represent different coping mechanisms. The deficient group took 38% longer to perform the exercises. Interpretation Kinematic differences were found between the deficient and intact knees after mobile unicompartmental knee replacement; but these kinematic changes do not seem to affect the medium-term clinical outcome. Whether these altered knee kinematics will have a clinical impact is as yet undetermined, but more long-term outcome data is required before mobile unicompartmental knee replacement can be recommended for an anterior cruciate ligament deficient patient. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Patients and methods: Demographic characteristics and operative data of 28 patients (27 males, 1 female; mean age 31.7±7.1 years; range 22 to 48 years) with unilateral ACL reconstruction were evaluated. Reconstruction was performed with patellar tendon graft in 22 patients (78.6%) and hamstring tendon graft in six patients (21.4%). Lysholm knee score was used for functional evaluation and chair stand test was used for lower extremity strength. Medial, intercondylar, and lateral distal femoral cartilage thicknesses of operated knees and healthy knees were measured with B-mode ultrasound, while strain ratios were measured with real time sonoelastography. Results: Postoperative mean follow-up duration was 20.4±9.8 months. Mean Lysholm knee and patient satisfaction scores were 88.0±8.5 and 8.2±1.8, respectively. Cartilage thicknesses were similar between operated and healthy knees (all p>0.05). Sonoelastographic strain ratio of medial distal femoral cartilage in operated knees was significantly higher (softer cartilage) (p=0.026). There was a negative correlation between strain ratio difference of medial cartilage of operated knees and lower extremity muscle strength (p=0.009, r= -0.487). Conclusion: While there was no difference for cartilage thickness between operated and healthy knees in B-mode ultrasound evaluation, detection of sonoelastographic strain ratio changes in medial distal femoral cartilage on the operated sides may indicate early structural changes following ACL reconstruction. Further studies are required to highlight the clinical effects of this relationship between the changes in cartilage structure and sonoelastography features.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Distal femoral cartilage; Elastography; Strain ratio; Ultrasound","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; cartilage; clinical article; female; femur; follow up; hamstring; human; Lysholm score; male; muscle strength; muscle training; patella ligament; patient satisfaction; surgery; tendon graft; thickness; ultrasound; adverse effects; anterior cruciate ligament; echography; elastography; femoral head; injuries; joint instability; knee; pathology; pathophysiology; Postoperative Complications; procedures; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Cartilage; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Female; Femur Head; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Fetto, Joseph F., The natural history and diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 147, pp. 29-38, (1980); Brandt, Kenneth D., Osteoarthritic changes in canine articular cartilage, subchondral bone, and synovium fifty‐four months after transection of the anterior cruciate ligament, Arthritis & Rheumatism, 34, 12, pp. 1560-1570, (1991); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Rotational changes at the knee after ACL injury cause cartilage thinning, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 442, pp. 39-44, (2006); Kannus, Pekka A., Conservatively treated tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.

The purpose of this study was to investigate neuromechanical changes in compensatory and anticipatory postural adjustments, which play a major role in minimizing unpredictable and predictable disturbances, respectively, as early as 2 months after ACLR. Methods: Nine young male individuals who underwent ACLR with patellar tendon and nine age-matched healthy controls were exposed to two blocks of ten either unexpected or expected loading perturbations of the knee joint, while semi-reclined on a raised plinth. Amplitude and latency of postural responses in the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were determined by surface electromyography. Results: Latency of compensatory responses was higher in patients with ACLR than in healthy participants for VL (82 ± 15 vs 68 ± 10 ms, P < 0.05) and RF (81 ± 21 vs 63 ± 10 ms, P < 0.05). Amplitude of compensatory responses was 54 % lower in patients with ACLR than in healthy participants for VL (P < 0.05). Onset of anticipatory responses occurred earlier in patients with ACLR than in healthy participants for VL (−83 ± 45 vs −26 ± 21 ms, P < 0.05), RF (−59 ± 48 vs −10 ± 13 ms, P < 0.05) and BF (−72 ± 42 vs −12 ± 14 ms, P < 0.01).

Methods One hundred and thirty-three knees with primary ACL reconstruction using the bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) graft were retrospectively identified. Twenty-two knees and 111 knees underwent isometric round tunnel (IRT) ACL reconstruction and anatomic rectangular tunnel (ART) ACL reconstruction, respectively. Results After femoral-side fixation of the graft in the surgery, the length change of the graft from 120° flexion to full extension was measured by using an isometric positioner at the tibial side. Both reconstructive techniques showed little length change from 120° to ∼20° of flexion, followed by elongation of the graft, until full extension. The amount of length change of the grafts was 1.0 ± 0.7 mm with the IRT technique, and 3.4 ± 0.9 mm with the ART technique. These findings were significantly different, based on the Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.001). Conclusion The native ACL has an intrinsic length change of 3-6 mm, and therefore the ART technique may more closely replicate the biomechanical function of the native ACL. © © 2015, Asia Pacific Knee, Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine Society.

Methods Twenty cadaveric semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were combined into QHT grafts. These were sized using a standard graft-sizing device and an area micrometer, yielding grafts ranging from 6 to 9.5 mm in diameter. The grafts were tested to failure. Five 10-mm BPTB grafts were also sized and tested. Results Clinical sizing did predict the strength of the graft but not profoundly. As a material alone, without consideration of fixation in bone tunnels, QHT grafts were stronger than BPTB grafts. Graft strength decreased with size, but a linear relation between strength and diameter (r2 = 0.715, P <.001) was found to be as good as the expected quadratic fit (r2 = 0.709). Compared with BPTB grafts, even the smallest QHT grafts (diameter <6.5 mm) were still significantly stronger than 10-mm BPTB grafts (P =.004). The elastic moduli of the QHT and BPTB grafts were 761 ± 187 MPa and 615 ± 403 MPa, respectively; elongations at failure were 12.0% ± 2.0% and 7.5% ± 1.6%, respectively; and failure stresses were 105 ± 18 MPa and 50 ± 14 MPa, respectively. Conclusions This work shows that a clinical size of QHT grafts of 6 mm in diameter is not a concern regarding the strength itself. For a possible lower-end prediction of acceptable size, assuming that a gracilis-semitendinosus graft would have only the stress of the weakest measured QHT graft of 88 MPa, a graft of 5.5 mm in diameter would suffice, having more strength in newtons than the average patellar tendon. Clinical Relevance Clinically sized QHT grafts have a higher failure strength than 10-mm patellar tendon grafts. Therefore the strength of the graft cannot account for the higher clinical failure rates of smaller hamstring grafts in active patients in clinical studies. © 2015 Arthroscopy Association of North America.","","adult; Article; clinical study; effect size; female; hamstring; human; male; measurement; middle aged; patella ligament; prediction; quadrupled hamstring tendon graft; semitendinous muscle; temperature measurement; tendon graft; Young modulus; aged; anatomy and histology; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; bone transplantation; cadaver; physiology; procedures; surgery; tendon; transplantation; weight bearing; Adult; Aged; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Cadaver; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Tendons; Weight-Bearing","","","","","Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation, OREF, (11-254); Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation, OREF","The authors report the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: P.J.S. and M.C.M. receive support from Allegheny Singer Research Institute and Arthrex (not used to test the performance of Arthrex equipment/supplies).

Hypothesis: There will be no difference in quadriceps muscle strength or International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores in patients with contralateral grafts compared with patients with ipsilateral grafts. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Between 2007 and 2009, a total of 279 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon graft from the contralateral knee met the inclusion criteria of unilateral knee involvement, no arthritic changes preoperatively, and minimum 2-year follow-up objective and subjective evaluations. A control group was obtained of 58 patients who had the same inclusion criteria and were of the same age but who underwent surgery with ipsilateral graft. Patients underwent a goaldirected and sequential postoperative rehabilitation program that first emphasized controlling a hemarthrosis and obtaining full knee range of motion immediately after surgery, followed by increasing leg strength and performing functional activities. The rehabilitation for the contralateral donor site emphasized high-repetition/low-resistance exercises beginning the day after surgery. The IKDC subjective data were compared between surgery groups. Quadriceps muscle strength was evaluated in both knees compared with the preoperative values obtained in the noninvolved knee and between knees at 2 years postoperatively. Results: Quadriceps muscle strength compared with the preoperative normal value (mean 6 SD) was 105% ± 29% in the ipsilateral ACL-reconstructed knee versus 114% ± 28.4% in the contralateral donor knee (P<.01) and 116% ± 25% in the contralateral ACL-reconstructed knee (P = .0339). Mean side-to-side strength (ACL-reconstructed knee/opposite knee) was 98.4% 6 13.6% in the contralateral group versus 92.9% ± 13.0% in the ipsilateral group (P<.01). The mean total IKDC score was 92.4 ± 9.6 for the contralateral donor knee. The mean IKDC total score for the ACL-reconstructed knee was 88.8 ± 12.3 in the contralateral group and 88.9 ± 11.2 in the ipsilateral group (P = .626). Conclusion: After ACL reconstruction with contralateral patellar tendon graft, patients can achieve strength symmetry between legs after surgery without experiencing adverse subjective symptoms after graft harvest. Furthermore, strength return can be superior with a contralateral graft than with an ipsilateral graft. © 2014 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament; contralateral; International Knee Document Committee; patellar tendon donor site; quadriceps strength; reconstruction; rehabilitation; subjective results","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autograft; autotransplantation; female; follow up; human; joint characteristics and functions; kinesiotherapy; knee; male; muscle strength; organ donor; patella ligament; physiology; procedures; quadriceps femoris muscle; rehabilitation; resistance training; retrospective study; transplantation; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Autografts; Exercise Therapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle Strength; Patellar Ligament; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Resistance Training; Retrospective Studies; Transplant Donor Site; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","2000 International Knee Documentation Committee Knee Evaluation Form, (2014); N Am J Sports Phys Ther, (2009); Brück, Ekhard, Morbidity after autogenous bone-patellar-bone graft harvest from the opposite knee, Unfallchirurg, 101, 10, pp. 775-778, (1998); Fujita, Norifumi, Comparison of the clinical outcome of double-bundle, anteromedial single-bundle, and posterolateral single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon graft with minimum 2-year follow-up, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 27, 7, pp. 906-913, (2011); Irrgang, James J., Development and validation of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 5, pp. 600-613, (2001); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Comparison of traditional and subcutaneous patellar tendon harvest: A prospective study of donor site-related problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using different graft harvesting techniques, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 3, pp. 328-335, (2000); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Complications following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A 2-5-year follow-up of 604 patients with special emphasis on anterior knee pain, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 1, pp. 2-8, (1999); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Donor-site morbidity and anterior knee problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autografts, Arthroscopy, 17, 9, pp. 971-980, (2001); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Factors affecting donor-site morbidity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 4, pp. 222-228, (1997); Lautamies, Riitta, Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength and knee function 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Comparison between bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring tendon autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 16, 11, pp. 1009-1016, (2008)","","","SAGE Publications Inc. claims@sagepub.com","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","25520302","English","Am.

Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone (BPTB) became the gold standard surgery where conservative management failed. Adding interferential screw provides rigid fixation which is important for early accelerated rehabilitation program in athletes but we have carried out this prospective interventional study in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and our private settings from January 2007 to December 2011 to assess whether interferential screws provide any clinical and functional advantage in general population. Sixty six male patients of 21-40 years age, with ACL deficient knees were reconstructed with BPTB graft where 40 cases were augmented by interferential screws and 26 cases without and followed up for minimum 2 years. The clinical and functional outcome (by Lysholm Knee Scoring), post-operative knee stability (by clinical tests) and complications were assessed and recorded. There was significant (p<0.05, paired 't' test) improvement of knee function (limp, walking, stair climbing, squatting, thigh atrophy) in both groups but no significant difference between them (p>0.05, chi squared test) regarding clinical, functional outcome and knee stability. The complications were insignificant (p>0.05, chi squared test) in both groups but there were few cases of screw related complications with augmentation and pronounced anterior knee laxity without it. So, ACL reconstruction by BPTB grafts with or without augmentation results consistent and comparable outcome in general population.","","adult; adverse effects; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; bone patellar tendon bone graft; bone screw; comparative study; human; knee; male; pathophysiology; procedures; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Bone Screws; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafts; Humans; Knee Joint; Male","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10224742","","","25725669","English","Mymensingh Med J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930978779"

Repair of the ACL often requires the use of autografts or allografts, and the RN first assistant (RNFA) often is the team member responsible for preparing the graft. Common grafts used in ACL repair include bone-patellar tendon-bone, hamstring, Achilles tendon, quadriceps tendon, and tibialis anterior tendon. The RNFA must be competent in preparing all of these grafts and in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using each graft, such as the reasons for graft choice, and must ensure that all graft-related supplies and equipment are available and ready for use. The ability to prepare all graft types expands treatment options, reduces surgical time, and enhances the role of the RNFA. © 2014 AORN, Inc.","ACL; ACL reconstruction; Allograft; Anterior cruciate ligament; Autograft; RN first assistant; RNFA","anterior cruciate ligament; human; injuries; orthopedic surgery; perioperative nursing; surgery; transplantation; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Humans; Orthopedic Procedures; Perioperative Nursing","","","","","","","Aaos Now, (2007); Bourke, Henry E., Survival of the anterior cruciate ligament graft and the contralateral ACL at a minimum of 15 years, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, 9, pp. 1985-1992, (2012); AORN Position Statement on RN First Assistants, (2014); Assisting in Surgery Patient Centered Care, (2009); Alexander S Care of the Patient in Surgery, (2011); Unwin, Andrew, (iii) What's new in anterior cruciate ligament surgery?, Orthopaedics and Trauma, 24, 2, pp. 100-106, (2010); undefined, (2014); Acl Surgery how to Get It Right the First Time and What to do if Itfails, (2010); Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment, (2006); Dempsey, Alasdair R., Changing sidestep cutting technique reduces knee valgus loading, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 37, 11, pp. 2194-2200, (2009)","","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00012092","","","25443120","English","AORN J.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908150663"

Materials and methods: A total of 150 patients with ACL disruption were included in the study. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon allograft was conducted on all knees using the same protocol. One hundred patients were prospectively randomised to either a group to receive double-spinning platelet-enriched gel (PRP) with leukocytes (n=50) or to a non-gel group (n=50). Finally, we included 50 patients treated with a platelet-rich preparation from a single-spinning procedure (PRGF Endoret® Technology) without leukocytes. Inflammatory parameters, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and knee perimeters (PER), were measured 24 hours and 10 days after surgery. Postoperative pain score (visual analogue score [VAS]) was recorded the day after surgery. Follow-up visits occurred postoperatively at 3, 6, and 12 months. The International Knee Documentation Committee scale (IKDC) was included to compare functional state, and MRI was conducted 6 months after surgery. Results: The PRGF group showed a statistically significant improvement in swelling and inflammatory parameters compared with the other two groups at 24 hours after surgery (p<0.05). The results did not show any significant differences between groups for MRI and clinical scores. Conclusions: PRGF used in ACL allograft reconstruction was associated with reduced swelling; however, the intensity and uniformity of the graft on MRI were similar in the three groups, and there was no clinical or pain improvement compared with the control group.

If equal in quality to conventional methods, the ITB graft could be a useful alternative as a primary graft, in revision surgery or multi-ligament reconstruction. The purpose is to assess whether the ITB autograft is a long-term reliable alternative to the bone-patella-tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft, using a prospective randomized controlled trial design.METHODS: From 1995 to 1996, sixty patients scheduled for primary ACL reconstruction were included in a prospective randomized controlled trial. Three senior knee surgeons, experienced in both types of ACL surgery, performed all the operations. A standardized and supervised rehabilitation programme was used for both groups for 6 months. Thirty patients received the ITB reconstruction, and 30 received the BPTB reconstruction. Forty-nine participated at follow-up in 2010 (82%). Primary outcome was the failure rate after ACL reconstruction. Secondary outcomes were knee injury osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) [pain, symptoms, Sport/Rec, quality of life (QOL), daily living function], Tegner activity scale, anterior knee pain-score, Lysholm score, Rolimeter laxity, extension deficit, single hop and crossover hop for distance.RESULTS: At 15-year follow-up, no significant difference existed between the groups. Graft failure occurred in 4 ITB subjects (16%) and 3 BPTB subjects (13%). KOOS (Sport/Rec) for the ITB group was 75 and 73 for the BPTB group. The KOOS (QOL) was 72 and 68 for the ITB group and BPTB group, respectively.CONCLUSION: Similar graft failure rates and KOOS were found when comparing ITB- and BPTB-operated individuals, at 15-year follow-up. The ITB graft had equal long-term clinical results compared to the BPTB graft and is recommended as a reliable alternative autograft for ACL reconstruction.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic studies, Level I.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; autotransplantation; bone transplantation; comparative study; controlled study; female; human; injuries; knee; Knee Injuries; male; middle aged; procedures; prospective study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Transplantation, Autologous; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","09422056","","","23974633","English","Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028137749"

Follow-ups were made during 4 years after surgical treatment with the KT1000 arthrometer for objective evaluation of sagittal stability. The Tegner scoring system for assessment of physical activity level and the Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for assessment of knee-specific health were evaluated after 4 and 12 years.RESULTS: KT1000 tests showed a significant decrease in mean manual maximum side-to-side difference after 4 years in both patients with and those without augmentation, without any statistical difference between the groups (n.s.).

Specifically, we compared the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores between groups and compared to established normative data. Furthermore we evaluated quadriceps muscle strength between surgery groups. Methods: Between 2007 and 2009, 279 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with an autogenous patellar tendon graft from the contralateral knee met the inclusion criteria of unilateral knee involvement, no evidence of arthritic changes preoperatively, and minimum 2 year follow-up objective and subjective evaluations. A control group was obtained of 58 patients who had the same inclusion criteria, were of the same age, but underwent surgery with ipsilateral graft. Patients underwent a goal-directed and sequential postoperative rehabilitation program that emphasized controlling a hemarthrosis, obtaining full knee range of motion as soon as possible after surgery, increasing leg strength, and functional activities to return patients back to sports. The rehabilitation for the contralateral donor site emphasized high repetition/low resistance exercises beginning the day after surgery to reconstitute the patellar tendon size and strength. IKDC subjective data was compared between surgery groups and established normative data. Quadriceps muscle strength was evaluated in both knees compared to the pre-operative values obtained in the non-involved knee; strength between knees at 2 years postoperatively was also evaluated. Results: When comparing quadriceps muscle strength to its pre-operative baseline value, the ipsilateral control group that had statistically significantly less strength in the ACL-reconstructed knee at 105% ± 29% compared with the contralateral group that had 114% ± 28.4% strength in the donor knee (P <.01) and 116% ± 25% strength in the ACL-reconstructed knee (P =.0339). When side-to-side strength was evaluated at 2 years post-operatively, the contralateral group had 98.4% ± 13.6% quadriceps muscle strength compared with 92.9% ± 13.0% in the ipsilateral control group (P <.01). The mean total IKDC scores obtained at the 2-year follow-up was 92.4 ± 9.6 for contralateral donor-knee, 88.8 ± 12.3 in the contralateral ACL-reconstructed knee, and 88.9 ± 11.2 for the control group ACL-reconstructed knee (p=0.960). There was also no statistical significant differences between groups for any of the IKDC sub-scores or total score (All P-values >.136; Table 1). The mean IKDC scores compared with established normative data of noninjured people of the same age and sex showed no large effect size differences between groups. Conclusion: With proper rehabilitation after surgery, use of a contralateral bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft with ACL reconstruction does not cause unresolved donor-site strength loss or subjective symptoms. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; autograft; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comparative study; controlled study; convalescence; donor site; exercise; follow up; human; human tissue; knee function; major clinical study; muscle strength; organ donor; patella ligament; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; range of motion","","","","","","","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd info@sagepub.co.uk","","","","","","23259671","","","","English","Orthop.

Patients were divided into three groups according to smoking history: Group 1, nonsmokers; Group 2, current smokers; and Group 3, former smokers. Preoperative values and twenty-four-month postoperative findings were compared among the groups. The stability of the ACL was evaluated with use of the Lachman test and the pivot-shift test, and anterior translation was tested with a KT2000 arthrometer. Functional outcomes were assessed on the basis of the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and objective grade.RESULTS: The three groups differed significantly in terms of postoperative knee translation, Lysholm score, and IKDC subjective score. The mean side-to-side difference in anterior translation (and standard deviation) was 2.08 ± 1.08 mm in Group 1 (nonsmokers), 2.65 ± 1.31 mm in Group 2 (smokers), and 2.15 ± 1.05 mm in Group 3 (former smokers) (p = 0.003). The mean Lysholm score was 90.5 ± 6.5 in Group 1, 86.0 ± 7.1 in Group 2, and 89.8 ± 6.3 in Group 3 (p < 0.001). The mean IKDC subjective score was 89.3 ± 5.1 in Group 1, 84.9 ± 7.5 in Group 2, and 88.5 ± 4.2 in Group 3 (p < 0.001). However, the difference in the IKDC subjective score among the three groups did not demonstrate a minimal clinically important difference. A dose-dependent association was noted between pack-years of exposure and postoperative anterior translation (estimate, 0.039; p = 0.015) and IKDC objective grade (odds ratio, 1.083; p = 0.002). A comparison of the three subgroups of smokers showed a significant difference in anterior translation (a mean side-to-side difference in anterior translation of 2.31 ± 1.17 mm for the light smokers, 2.60 ± 1.14 mm for the moderate smokers, and 3.29 ± 1.55 mm for the heavy smokers; p = 0.038). The three subgroups also differed significantly in terms of the proportion of cases by IKDC objective grade; among the light smokers, thirteen (42%) were grade A, fifteen (48%) were grade B, two (7%) were grade C, and one (3%) was grade D; among the moderate smokers, seven (35%) were grade A, eight (40%) were grade B, four (20%) were grade C, and one (5%) was grade D; and among the heavy smokers, one (6%) was grade A, eight (44%) were grade B, eight (44%) were grade C, and one (6%) was grade D (p = 0.013).CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking appeared to have a negative effect on subjective and objective outcomes of ACL reconstruction, and heavy smokers showed greater knee instability. Patients who had stopped smoking at least one month prior to ACL reconstruction had no significant difference in outcomes compared with patients who had never smoked.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level III.

The proposed model included the tibia-femoral and patella-femoral joints, articular cartilage and menisci. Key surgical parameters were incorporated including bone-patellar-tendon-bone graft excision and pre-tensioning, tunnel morphology, bone plugs, and bone plug fixation. Several simulation steps were parameterized to reflect the clinically reported surgical procedure. Our focus was to explore the intra-operative effects of variations in tunnel directions on the selected metrics of joint mechanics during Lachman and Anterior Drawer tests. A mathematical construct capable of transforming the limited and heterogeneous experimental and surgical data to evidence-based validation was adopted to ensure the viability of the finite element models. We found that the proposed models, subject to a variation in tunnel directions, resulted in simulation outputs that favor the reported experimental data of Lachman and Anterior Drawer tests under uncertainty. Simulation results for a population of three-dimensional tunnel orientations provided insights into the graft-tunnel contact mechanics and the spatial stress distribution in the graft, insights that have been anecdotally observed in prior experimental studies. The intraarticular graft tension was found to be higher than the estimated in tunnel graft force, and larger differences were found for the least inclined tunnels exhibiting higher contact pressures, transverse bending and twisting of the graft and Von-Mises stress at the graft-femoral tunnel interface. Conversely, tunnels with high inclination angles exhibited higher intraarticular graft tension and Von-Mises stress at the graft-tibial bone plug interface. © 2014.","Articular cartilage osteoarthritis; Experimental errors; Finite element model; Surgical variability; Tunnel direction; Validation under epistemic uncertainty","Bone; Cartilage; Deformation; Finite element method; Metadata; Stress concentration; Surgery; Uncertainty analysis; Articular cartilages; Computational framework; Epistemic uncertainties; Experimental errors; Mathematical constructs; Reconstructive surgery; Surgical procedures; Surgical variability; Computer simulation; article; articular cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery; biomechanics; bone graft; bone plug; clinical article; contact pressure; evidence based practice; finite element analysis; fracture fixation; human; human cell; human tissue; intraarticular graft tension; intraoperative period; joint; joint mechanics; knee arthroplasty; knee cruciate ligament; knee meniscus; laboratory test; Lachman and Anterior Drawer test; mathematical model; mechanics; patella femoral joint; pretensioning; priority journal; simulation; stress; surgical technique; tibia femoral joint; transverse bending; twisting; validation process; von Mises stress; Articular cartilage osteoarthritis; Finite element model; Tunnel direction; Validation under epistemic uncertainty; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Femur; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Joints; Menisci, Tibial; Models, Biological; Patella; Tibia; Uncertainty","","","","","","","Amis, Andrew Arthur, Anterior cruciate ligament graft positioning, tensioning and twisting, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, SUPPL. 1, pp. S2-S12, (1998); Abebe, Ermias Shawel, The effects of femoral graft placement on in vivo knee kinematics after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Biomechanics, 44, 5, pp. 924-929, (2011); Andersen, Henrik Nørholm, Reconstruction of chronic insufficient anterior cruciate ligament in the knee using a synthetic Dacron prosthesis: A prospective study of 57 cases, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 20-23, (1992); An, Kainan, Measurement of friction between pulley and flexor tendon, Biomedical Sciences Instrumentation, 29, pp. 1-7, (1993); Agarwal, Harish K., Uncertainty quantification using evidence theory in multidisciplinary design optimization, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 85, 1-3, pp. 281-294, (2004); Adouni, Malek, Computational biodynamics of human knee joint in gait: From muscle forces to cartilage stresses, Journal of Biomechanics, 45, 12, pp. 2149-2156, (2012); Bae, Harok, An approximation approach for uncertainty quantification using evidence theory, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 86, 3, pp. 215-225, (2004); Bloch, Isabelle, Some aspects of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory for classification of multi-modality medical images taking partial volume effect into account, Pattern Recognition Letters, 17, 8, pp. 905-919, (1996); Brand, Jeff C., Graft fixation in cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 5, pp. 761-774, (2000); Burks, Robert T., The effect of continuous passive motion on anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction stability, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 4, pp. 323-327, (1984)","S.

The previous surgical technique did not require the surgeon to pay particular attention to the length of the bone block, and therefore, there is scant evidence in the literature describing ideal lengths. With the gaining popularity of accessory medial portal drilling of the femoral tunnel, concerns with tunnel length and graft shuttling have surfaced. Newer techniques have advised shortening of the femoral bone block to accommodate the shorter tunnel and for ease of bone block manipulation into the aperture of the tunnel. Purpose: To compare the effects of bone block length on the pull-out strength of patellar tendon grafts using metal interference screws in a porcine ACL reconstruction model. The hypothesis was that the pull-out strength of each length of bone block under cyclic and ultimate load to failure testing would surpass the physiologic loads experienced by a normal ACL. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: This study used 27 unmatched porcine femurs and BPTB constructs. Specimens were randomly assigned to a 10-, 15-, or 20-mm bone block reconstruction and a cycle load of 100, 500, or 1000 cycles. This resulted in 9 specimen groups with 3 specimens in each group. A central composite design (CCD) for the test matrix was selected, as this was optimum for requiring relatively few experiments while still exploring the complete range of interest for 2 independent variables. Each reconstruction used a 7 × 20–mm titanium interference screw. All reconstructions were performed on the femoral side using 10-mm-wide patellar tendon grafts, and tensile tests were performed. The loading protocol started with a 20-N preload, then cyclic testing to the appropriate number of cycles in the elastic region between 50 and 150 N at a strain rate of 200 mm/min, and then ended with ultimate load-tofailure testing. Ultimate load to failure, peak stress, elongation, and stiffness were all recorded. The patellar tendon graft mode of failure was measured by visual inspection. Results: During load-to-failure testing, 5 of 9 graft constructs in the 10-mmgroup failed at the bone block, while 2 of 9 failed in the 15- mm group at this interface. In the 20-mm group, all 9 specimens failed at the tendon, and none failed at the bone block. There was a statistically significant difference in modes of failure between the bone block length groups in the reconstructed ACL grafts. Analysis indicates that a smaller bone block length graft ismore likely to fail due to a bone block failure than a tendon failure. The average ± standard deviation failure load for all specimenswas 573 ± 171 N.Themean failure loads for the 10-, 15-, and 20-mmgroupswere 614 ± 110, 658 ± 92, and 540 ± 203 N, respectively. There was no statistical significance between the groups in any of these measurements. Conclusion: Bone blocks of 20 to 25mmin length are normally used in surgical practice. Thus, the purpose of this studywas to explore the effects of asmaller boneblock length in the fixation strength of a graft. This study couldnot yielda significant difference in failure load for differently sized bone blocks. There was a significant tendency of shorter bone block lengths to fail due to bone block failure. Clinical Relevance: Bone block failure was defined as slippage of the bone block or interference screw. These results show that using a smaller bone block may increase the likelihood of a graft failure in an ACL reconstruction. © The Author(s) 2014.","ACL reconstruction; BTB autograft; Interference screw fixation","animal model; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; biomechanics; bone block length; bone length; bone patellar tendon bone graft; bone stress; central composite design; correlation coefficient; interference screw; leg lengthening; loading test; muscle strength; musculoskeletal stiffness; nonhuman; priority journal; statistical concepts; swine; tendon graft; tensile strength","","","","","","","Bonney, Heather E., Regional variation in the mechanical properties of cortical bone from the porcine femur, Medical Engineering and Physics, 33, 4, pp. 513-520, (2011); Brown, Gregory Alexander, Fixation strength of interference screw fixation in bovine, young human, and elderly human cadaver knees: Influence of insertion torque, tunnel-bone block gap, and interference, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 238-244, (1996); Dunkin, Brad S., Soft tissue tendon graft fixation in serially dilated or extraction-drilled tibial tunnels: A porcine model study using high-resolution quantitative computerized tomography, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 35, 3, pp. 448-457, (2007); Caborn, David N.M., Biomechanical comparison between BioScrew and titanium alloy interference screws for bone-patellar tendon-bone graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 13, 2, pp. 229-232, (1997); Clancy, William G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using one-third of the patellar ligament, augmented by extra-articular tendon transfers, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 64, 3, pp. 352-359, (1982); How to Apply Response Surface Methodology, (1990); Jones, K.

To evaluate tendon-to-bone healing after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in the fibrous interzone (FIZ) of the femoral and tibial tunnels using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods. Five men and 5 women (mean age, 29 years) underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction by a single surgeon, using the semitendinosus and gracilis tendon. The tendon-to-bone healing in the FIZ was evaluated using sagittal and coronal MRI at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 weeks, with the knee flexed at 60º and the tendon graft straight in both images. The signal intensity of the FIZ was visually assessed by comparing it with anatomic landmarks in the same patient’s knee, and classified into 4 grades. It was grade 3 when similar to that of the patellar tendon, grade 2 when similar to that of skeletal muscle, grade 1 when greater than that of muscle but less than that of joint fluid, and grade 0 when similar to that of joint fluid. At 24 weeks, subjective and objective functional outcomes were evaluated using the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee score. Results. At 24 weeks, no patient had knee laxity. All patients had an International Knee Documentation Committee score of A, and their mean Lysholm score was 98.5. In the femoral tunnel, the FIZ did not change during the first 9 weeks (in particular the anterior part), but healing occurred rapidly thereafter. In the tibial tunnel, the FIZ healed over time in all locations, and healing was complete in the lateral and posterior parts at 12 weeks, and in all locations at 24 weeks. The mean signal intensity grade was significantly higher in the tibial than femoral FIZ at 3 to 12 weeks (p<0.01). Conclusion. After ACL reconstruction, the tendon-to-bone healing in the FIZ of the tibial tunnel was faster than that of the femoral tunnel. © 2014, Hong Kong University Press.

Close HTO using rigid plate fixation and ACL reconstruction with bone patellar tendon bone graft was performed in Group A (7 patients). An open HTO using Puddu plate and ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft was performed in Group B (9 patients). The mean age in Group A was 41 years old with an average varus of 8 degrees. Mean age in Group B was 42 years old and with 4 degrees of varus. Lysholm Score, HSS and Radiographs were performed. Results: Group A obtained a mean Lysholm score of 94, mean HSS of 91. Group B showed a mean Lysholm score of 83, mean HSS of 87. The mean follow-up was 5 years in both groups. In all cases osteotomies consolidated. Discussion: Technically we found that open HTO with hamstrings had several advantages such as lower risk of peroneal nerve injury, use of one incision, no problems as regards graft length, possibility of fixing the graft in the proximal tibia, maintenance of tibial slope and preservation of bone stock. The Open HTO need of osseous graft, may produce patella baja and the risk of nonunion is higher. This technique is indicated for relaxed medial collateral ligament. As regards the Close HTO there may be possibilities of a peroneal nerve injury, it may decrease the tibial slope, patellar ascent, loss of bone, the need to disrupt either the fibula or proximal tibio-fibular joint and may generate instability in the posterolateral corner and the screws could compromise the tunnels path. The advantages are provision of bone to bone contact with excellent union rates and the potential for full early weight-bearing. Conclusion: In spite of these issues, both procedures relieved pain and restored knee stability and the choice will depend on each particular case. © The Author(s) 2014.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone graft; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical article; controlled study; follow up; high tibial valgus osteotomy; hip osteoarthritis; human; knee instability; Lysholm score; medial collateral ligament; osteolysis; osteotomy; plate fixation; priority journal; radiography; retrospective study; tendon graft","","","","","","","","","","SAGE Publications Ltd info@sagepub.co.uk","","","","","","23259671","","","","English","Orthop.

Although bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft has an extensive track record, showing excellent clinical results, donor-site morbidity and graft-tunnel mismatch can still be problematic for a subset of patients. In the setting of a tendon graft that is too long, adequate interference screw fixation cannot be obtained, typically resulting in a tibial-sided bone plug that achieves less than 15 to 20mm of bone in the distal tibial tunnel. We present an easy and effective technique for avoiding the graft-tunnel mismatch problems that commonly occur in patients who have an excessively long patellar tendons. This technique involves a simple preoperative planning algorithm that ultimately results in a single tibial-sided plug harvest. Bony interference fixation is then obtained on the femoral side and soft-tissue fixation on the tibial side. This technique allows for satisfactory graft fixation while avoiding the donor-site morbidity associated with patellar bone plug harvest. © 2014 Arthroscopy Association of North America.","","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone; graft failure; graft tunnel length mismatch; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; operation duration; orthopedic fixation device; outcome assessment; patient safety; patient satisfaction; preoperative period; priority journal; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment planning","","","","","","","Kim, Hasung, Current trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery and Related Research, 25, 4, pp. 165-173, (2013); West, Robin Vereeke, Graft selection in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction., The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 13, 3, pp. 197-207, (2005); Denti, Matteo, Graft-tunnel mismatch in endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Intraoperative and cadaver measurement of the intra-articular graft length and the length of the patellar tendon, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 3, pp. 165-168, (1998); Shaffer, Benjamin S., Graft-tunnel mismatch in endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A new technique of intraarticular measurement and modified graft harvesting, Arthroscopy, 9, 6, pp. 633-646, (1993); Fowler, B.

This prospective, randomized clinical trial aimed to compare two methods of fixation for BPTB grafts: press-fit fixation vs. interference screw, over a 12-month follow-up interval. Methods: 158 patients with an average age of 29.8 years, between 2011 and 2012, were treated for torn ACL. 82 patients underwent reconstruction with BPTB autograft with a press fit fixation technique, and in 76 cases an interference screw was used. At the time of final follow-up, 71 patients in press-fit group and 65 patients in interference screw group were evaluated in terms of return to pre-injury activity level, pain, knee stability, range of motion, IKDC score and complications. Results: At 12-month follow-up, 59 (83 %) and 55 (85 %) in press-fit and screw group, respectively had good-to-excellent IKDC score (p > 0.05). The mean laxity assessed using a KT-1000 arthrometer improved to 2.7 and 2.5 mm in press-fit and screw group, respectively. Regarding Lachman and pivot shift test, there was a statistically significant improvement in the integrity of the ACL in both the groups, but no significant differences was noted between groups. There were no significant differences in terms of femur circumference difference, effusion, knee range of motion, pain and complications. Conclusions: The press-fit technique is an efficient procedure. Its outcome was comparable with the interference screw group. Furthermore it has unlimited bone-to-bone healing, no need for removal of hardware, ease for revision and cost effectiveness. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bone-patellar tendon-bone graft; Interference screw; Outcome; Press fit fixation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthrometer; article; athletic performance; bone patellar tendon bone graft; bone staple; climbing; controlled study; female; fracture fixation; human; interference screw; intermethod comparison; joint laxity; knee function; knee instability; major clinical study; male; orthopedic guide pin; patella fracture; patellofemoral pain syndrome; physical capacity; press fit fixation; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; running; treatment outcome; weight bearing; wound infection; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone Screws; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafts; Female; Femur; Humans; Joint Instability; Male; Pain Measurement; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","KT-1000","","","","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Risberg, May Arna G., Design and implementation of a neuromuscular training program following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 31, 11, pp. 620-631, (2001); Crucial Ligaments Diagnosis and Treatment of Ligamentous Injuries about the Knee, (1988); Ferretti, Andrea, Osteoarthritis of the knee after ACL reconstruction, International Orthopaedics, 15, 4, pp. 367-371, (1991); Jörgensen, Uffe, Long-term follow-up of meniscectomy in athletes.

This disabling pain is persistent with conventional rehabilitation protocols. The aim of this work is to validate a new rehabilitation protocol that may improve the patients and allow return to daily activities including sports. Materials and methods: Forty-three patients identified with functional AKP after ACL reconstruction was enrolled in the rehabilitation protocol between 2009 and 2011. The series included twenty-six patients with hamstring grafting and seventeen patients with patellar tendon transplant. This study compares the functional outcomes and pain scores before and after the isokinetic protocol until the last follow-up at an average of 25.7 months after surgery. The evaluation was performed according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and included a pain assessment using the visual analog scale. Statistical analysis used Student's t-test for unpaired data and the Pearson correlation test for the variables. The IKDC scores were compared by the Wilcoxon test. Results: Functional outcomes and pain are significantly improved (p < 0.0001). The average IKDC score improved with 28 points and the pain improved with 3.2 points on the visual analog scale (VAS). The results are correlated with the follow-up time (p = 0.008) but not correlated with the delay between the surgery and the beginning of the isokinetic protocol. Discussion: Isokinetic rehabilitation provides a significant improvement in the knee function as measured by the IKDC score and by the VAS, regardless of the painful period preceding the program. The function improvement continues after the end of the protocol, but the pain may not completely disappear. The isokinetic rehabilitation program may resume functional AKP related to muscular deficit and may be used as the starter of other physical therapy protocols.

Methods Of the 105 consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, the 52 patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstruction and in whom tunnel measurement could be obtained by computed tomography were included in this study. In 26 patients, double-bundle reconstruction (DBR) of the ACL using hamstring tendons was performed. These patients were compared with 26 patients in whom rectangular tunnel ACL reconstruction using BPTB grafts (BPTBR) was performed. Femoral tunnel aperture positioning and TW were investigated postoperatively using 3-dimensional computed tomographic images, which were performed a week and a year after surgery in all patients. Results In DBR, the average diameter of the anteromedial (AM) femoral tunnel increased by 34.0% in the horizontal direction and 28.2% in the vertical direction, whereas that of the posterolateral (PL) femoral tunnel increased by 58.2% and 73.4%, respectively, at 1 year after surgery compared with 1 week after surgery. The percentage TW value of the PL tunnel was significantly greater than that of the AM tunnel. In BPTBR, the average diameter increased by 22.0% and 17.1%, respectively. The percentage TW value of the PL tunnel in DBR was significantly greater than that of the femoral tunnel in BPTBR. Each tunnel aperture migrated distally (""shallow"") in the horizontal direction and high in the vertical direction. AM and PL tunnel apertures in DBR migrated in the vertical direction significantly more than they did in BPTBR. No significant differences between the 2 groups were found in clinical outcomes. Conclusions The femoral PL tunnel aperture in DBR showed significantly more widening than did the AM tunnel aperture in DBR and the femoral tunnel aperture in BPTBR. Also, greater migration of the femoral tunnel aperture in the vertical direction because of TW was observed in DBR than in BPTBR.

Methods A prospective analytical study was conducted on patients undergoing ACL reconstruction by means of the isometric and anatomical techniques, using grafts from the knee flexor tendons or patellar tendon. Twenty-eight patients were recruited during the immediate postoperative period, at the knee surgery outpatient clinic of FCMMG-HUSJ. Radiographs of the operated knee were produced in anteroposterior (AP) view with the patient standing on both feet and in lateral view with 30° of flexion. The lines were traced out and the distances and angles were measured on the lateral radiograph to evaluate the sagittal plane. The distance from the center of the screw to the posterior cortical bone of the lateral condyle was measured and divided by the Blumensaat line. In relation to the height of the screw, the distance from the center of the screw to the joint surface of the lateral condyle of the knee was measured. On the AP radiograph, evaluating the coronal plane, the angle between the anatomical axis of the femur and a line traced at the center of the screw was measured. Results With regard to the P measurement (posteriorization of the interference screw), the tests showed that the p-value (0.4213) was greater than the significance level used (0.05), the null hypothesis was not rejected and it could be stated that there was no statistically significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. With regard to the H measurement (height of the screw in relation to the lower cortical bone of the knee), the p-value observed (0.0006) was less than the significance level used (0.05), the null hypothesis was rejected and it could be stated that there was a statistically significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. It can be concluded that the latter difference occurred because the isometric technique generated greater values for the H measurement than did the anatomical technique. With regard to the MED variable (position of the screw on the AP radiograph), the observed p-value (0.000) was less than the significance level (5%), the null hypothesis was rejected and it could be stated with 95% confidence that there was a significant difference between the anatomical and isometric techniques. Conclusions There were statistically significant differences in the radiological evaluations of the femoral tunnel, both in the sagittal and in the coronal plane, between the ACL reconstruction techniques. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Ortopedia e Traumatologia.

As hamstring tendon autografts are becoming more commonly used, a study examining the effect of contralateral graft harvest of semitendinosus gracilis (STG) tendons on patient quality of life was conducted. Purpose: To evaluate if ACLR using a hamstring tendon autograft results in better patient quality of life if the graft is harvested from the leg contralateral to the ACL rupture compared with the ipsilateral leg. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 100 participants between 16 and 50 years of age with a complete ACL tear were randomly assigned to undergo ACLR using either the ipsilateral or contralateral leg as the STG graft donor. Primary outcome measures were the ACL Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QOL), concentric knee flexion and extension strength at 60 and 240 deg/s, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, early postoperative pain and diary of analgesic use, and rate of reruptures. Outcome measures were evaluated before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Results: The ACL-QOL score improved over time for both groups (P<.001), and there were no significant differences between groups at any time point (P = .528). Significant differences in knee flexion and extension strength were found at 3 months after surgery. There were no differences between groups in IKDC knee assessment scores or rerupture rates. Conclusion: There does not appear to be any measurable benefit or drawback in quality of life to the use of an STG graft from the unaffected limb. In light of this finding, further research to examine other possible effects on agility and balance as well as time and ability to return to sport should be conducted. Longer term follow-up beyond 2 years would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the risk of reruptures or contralateral reruptures using this novel approach. © 2013 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament; contralateral; hamstring graft; reconstruction","adult; analgesia; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; autotransplantation; Canada; comparative study; contralateral; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; hamstring graft; human; knee; male; methodology; multicenter study; physiology; postoperative pain; prospective study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; reconstruction; recurrent disease; skeletal muscle; statistics; transplantation; young adult; Adult; Analgesia; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Pain, Postoperative; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Recurrence; Transplantation, Autologous; Young Adult","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Bone-patellar tendon-bone compared with double semitendinosus and gracilis tendon grafts - A prospective, randomized clinical trial, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 86, 10, pp. 2143-2155, (2004); Bourke, Henry E., Survival of the anterior cruciate ligament graft and the contralateral ACL at a minimum of 15 years, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, 9, pp. 1985-1992, (2012); Chechik, Ofir, An international survey on anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction practices, International Orthopaedics, 37, 2, pp. 201-206, (2013); Duquin, Thomas R., Current trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction., The journal of knee surgery, 22, 1, pp. 7-12, (2009); Feller, Julian A., A randomized comparison of patellar tendon and hamstring tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 31, 4, pp. 564-573, (2003); Grant, John A., Comparison of home versus physical therapy-supervised rehabilitation programs after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomized clinical trial, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 9, pp. 1288-1297, (2005); Hartigan, Erin H., Preoperative predictors for noncopers to pass return to sports criteria after ACL reconstruction, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, 28, 4, pp. 366-373, (2012); Hiemstra, Laurie Anne, Hamstring and quadriceps strength balance in normal and hamstring anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed subjects, Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 14, 5, pp. 274-280, (2004); Hiemstra, Laurie Anne, Knee strength deficits after hamstring tendo and patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 32, 8, pp. 1472-1479, (2000); Jari, Sanjiv, Staged bilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of contralateral patellar tendon autograft.

The bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft has been accepted as the gold standard for ACL reconstruction. However, donor site morbidities cannot be avoided after this treatment. The artificial ligament of ligament advanced reinforcement system (LARS) has been recommended for ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to compare the midterm outcome of ACL reconstruction using BPTB autografts or LARS ligaments. Between July 2004 and March 2006, the ACL reconstruction using BPTB autografts in 30 patients and LARS ligaments in 32 patients was performed. All patients were followed up for at least 4 years and evaluated using the Lysholm knee score, Tegner score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and KT-1000 arthrometer test. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the data of Lysholm scores, Tegner scores, IKDC scores, and KT-1000 arthrometer test at the latest follow-up. Our study demonstrates that the similarly good clinical results are obtained after ACL reconstruction using BPTB autografts or LARS ligaments at midterm follow-up. In addition to BPTB autografts, the LARS ligament may be a satisfactory treatment option for ACL rupture. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Artificial ligament; Autograft; Ligament advanced reinforcement system","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthrometer; article; block screw; bone drill; bone patellar tendon bone graft; cartilage injury; controlled study; debridement; drill guide; female; gold standard; human; intermethod comparison; international knee documentation committee score; joint laxity; Kirschner wire; knee instability; knee ligament surgery; knee meniscus rupture; KT 1000 arthrometer test; leg exercise; ligament advanced reinforcement system; ligament prosthesis; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; meniscal repair; osteophyte; outcome assessment; priority journal; resistance training; retrospective study; scoring system; Tegner activity score; titanium interference screw; wire loop; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Autografts; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Female; Humans; Male; Prostheses and Implants; Retrospective Studies; Rupture; Treatment Outcome","","","LARS, Surgical implants and devices","Surgical implants and devices","(Y20120027); (2011ZYC-A024)","Acknowledgments This work was supported by the clinical foundation of medical association of Zhejiang province (2011ZYC-A024) and Science and Technology Project of Wenzhou City (Y20120027).","Busam, Matthew L., Complications of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone constructs: Care and prevention, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 36, 2, pp. 379-394, (2008); Klein, Wilhelm, Synovitis and artificial ligaments, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 1, pp. 116-124, (1992); Paulos, Lonnie E., The GORE-TEX anterior cruciate ligament prosthesis: A long-term followup, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 3, pp. 246-252, (1992); Lavoie, Pauline, Patient satisfaction needs as related to knee stability and objective findings after ACL reconstruction using the LARS artificial ligament, Knee, 7, 3, pp. 157-163, (2000); Gao, Kai, Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With LARS Artificial Ligament: A Multicenter Study With 3- to 5-Year Follow-up, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 26, 4, pp. 515-523, (2010); Dericks, Gerard, Ligament advanced reinforcementsystem anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Operative Techniques in Sports Medicine, 3, 3, pp. 187-205, (1995); Tegner, Yelverton, Rating systems in the evaluation of knee ligament injuries, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 198, pp. 43-49, (1985); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993); Noyes, Frank R., Biomechanical analysis of human ligament grafts used in knee-ligament repairs and reconstructions, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 66, 3, pp. 344-352, (1984); Park, Min-jong, A comparative study of the healing of tendon autograft and tendon-bone autograft using patellar tendon in rabbits, International Orthopaedics, 25, 1, pp. 35-39, (2001)","T.

Indication: Acute and chronic functional instability with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament giving way phenomena, acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament with concomitant meniscus repair. Contraindications: Local infection in the knee joint, local soft tissue damage, lack of cooperation of the patient. Surgical technique: The operation begins with the examination under anesthesia. It follows an arthroscopic examination of the knee and the arthroscopic treatment of accompanying intra-articular lesions (meniscus and cartilage damage). The semitendinosus tendon is harvested via a 3 cm skin incision medial to the tibial tuberosity. A four stranded tendon graft is prepared with a minimum length of 6.5 cm. Alternetive grafts for this technique are the patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, and allografts. The femoral tunnel for the ACL graft is drilled via a deep anteromedial portal under arthroscopic control. For precise placement of the guide wire a specific offset aimer is used. For drilling the knee must be flexed more than 110. Landmarks are the intercondylar line and the cartilage-bone interface. The position of the guide wire is always controlled by the medial portal (medial portal view). The guide wire is overdrilled with a cannulated drill (4.5 mm when a flip tack is used). The drill diameter for the 30 mm long blind tunnel is choosen according to the graft diameter. A gentle tunnel preparation may be achieved with the use of dilators. At the tibia, the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus is used as a landmark in the absence of ACL stump. The guide wire is first overdrilled with a 6 mm drill. Slight adjustments to the tibial tunnel location can be archieved when the guide wire is overdrilled eccentrically with a larger drill. At the femur an extrakortikal fixation technique with a flip button is preferred. At the tibia, a hybrid fixation with absorbable interference screw and button is used. Rehabilitaion: The rehabilitation program is divided into three phases. During the inflammatory phase (1st-2nd week) control of pain and swelling is recommended. The patient is lmobilized with 20 kg partial weigth bearing. During the proliferative phase (3nd-6th week), load and mobility are slowly increased. Goal of this phase is it full extension. Exercises should be performed in a closed chain. During the remodeling phase strength and coordination exercises can be started. Athletes should not return to competitive sports before the 6th to 8th month. Results: In a prospective study, we have examined 21 patients treated with an anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in single-bundle technique, after two years. As graft the semitendinosus was used. The postoperative MRI diagnosis showed that all tunnels were positioned anatomically. KT 1000 measurement showed that the difference of anterior translation decreased from an average of 6.4-1.7 mm. A sliding pivot shift phenomenon was detected in only one patient. The postoperative Lysholmscore was 94.2 points. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arthroscopic surgery; Hybrid fixation; Tendon transfer; Tibia; Treatment outcome","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; clinical article; coordination; drill; exercise; guide wire; human; interference screw; joint pressure; knee arthroscopy; knee meniscus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; quadriceps tendon; rehabilitation; semitendinous muscle; single bundle technique; skin incision; surgical technique; tendon graft; tendon transfer; tibia; tibia tuberosity; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroplasty; Humans; Knee Injuries; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Alentorn-Geli, Eduard, Anteromedial portal versus transtibial drilling techniques in ACL reconstruction: A blinded cross-sectional study at two- to five-year follow-up, International Orthopaedics, 34, 5, pp. 747-754, (2010); Bedi, Asheesh, The ""Footprint"" Anterior Cruciate Ligament Technique: An Anatomic Approach to Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 25, 10, pp. 1128-1138, (2009); Bedi, Asheesh, Transtibial versus anteromedial portal reaming in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: An anatomic and biomechanical evaluation of surgical technique, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 27, 3, pp. 380-e41, (2011); Behrendt, Sven, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Drilling a femoral posterolateral tunnel cannot be accomplished using an over-the-top step-off drill guide, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 18, 9, pp. 1252-1256, (2010); Chhabra, Anikar, Tunnel Expansion After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Autogenous Hamstrings: A Comparison of the Medial Portal and Transtibial Techniques, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 10, pp. 1107-1112, (2006); Dargel, Jens, Femoral bone tunnel placement using the transtibial tunnel or the anteromedial portal in ACL reconstruction: A radiographic evaluation, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 17, 3, pp. 220-227, (2009); Harner, Christopher Dechant, Double bundle or double trouble?, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 20, 10, pp. 1013-1014, (2004); Herbort, Mirco, ACL mismatch reconstructions: Influence of different tunnel placement strategies in single-bundle ACL reconstructions on the knee kinematics, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 18, 11, pp. 1551-1558, (2010); Ho, Jason Yan Dah, Equal Kinematics Between Central Anatomic Single-Bundle and Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstructions, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 25, 5, pp. 464-472, (2009); Kopf, Sebastian H., Transtibial ACL reconstruction technique fails to position drill tunnels anatomically in vivo 3D CT study, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 20, 11, pp. 2200-2207, (2012)","W.

Material and methods: A nonrandomized study, which included consecutive patients (n= 31) who underwent ACL reconstruction and were evaluated 2-5 years after ligament reconstruction. The surgical techniques used were the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BTB), quadriceps tendon (QT) and semitendinosus gracilis tendons (ST-G). The clinical evaluation included the Tegner activity Index (TI), Lysholm Index (LI), Index Knee Outcome Survey (KOS) in their sub-divisions "" Total"", "" Activities of Daily Living"" and "" Functionality"" (KOS-T, KOS-ADL, KOS-IF) and Noyes Test (NT). The Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 for Windows was used for the statistical study. Results: Before injury, the TI was 6.74 and after injury 4.35; the LI average was 89.55; the KOS-T was 70.48, KOS-ADL 30.48 and KOS-FI 39.95; and the NT gave a symmetry score of 96.6%. No significant correlations were found between the values of the TI before and after injury, or between the values of the LI and KOS-ADL, and the LI and NT. Conclusion: ACL injury is associated with a high number of meniscal and chondral injuries, with direct impact on the prognosis of these patients' sport activity and a reduction in activity levels. This reduction is not accompanied by a significant functional loss and normal daily activities are unaffected. The motivation of the patient and medical advice are considered key factors in promoting recovery to the pre-lesional level. © 2013.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Function; Physical activity; Surgical techniques","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; daily life activity; human; physical activity; quadriceps tendon; semitendinous muscle","","","","","","","Programa De Reabilitacao Funcional Na Lesao do Ligamento Cruzado Anterior, (1992); Rev Port Med Desport, (1990); Dye, Scott F., Anatomy and biomechanics of the anterior cruciate ligament., Clinics in sports medicine, 7, 4, pp. 715-725, (1988); J Traumatol Sport, (1989); Beynnon, Bruce D., Treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, Part 2, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 11, pp. 1751-1767, (2005); Clin Orthop Relat Res, (1999); Holm, Inger L., No Difference in Knee Function or Prevalence of Osteoarthritis after Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with 4-Strand Hamstring Autograft Versus Patellar Tendon-Bone Autograft, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 3, pp. 448-454, (2010); Neuman, Paul, Patellofemoral osteoarthritis 15 years after anterior cruciate ligament injury - a prospective cohort study, Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, 17, 3, pp. 284-290, (2009); Gillquist, Jan, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and the long term incidence of gonarthrosis, Sports Medicine, 27, 3, pp. 143-156, (1999); Louboutin, Hugues, Osteoarthritis in patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture: A review of risk factors, Knee, 16, 4, pp. 239-244, (2009)","J.

We made 2215 reconstructions of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee using bone-patellar tendon-bone technique, and 10 patients had fracture of the patella (0.45%), and fore patients had rupture of the patellar tendon (0.18%). The fracture of the patella in two patients was treated nonoperatively and 8 patients was treated with operative reduction and osteosynthesis. Reconstruction of the patellar ligament in four patients with a rupture of patellar tendon (0.18%) was performed by a technique previously published with BTB allograft taken from the local bone bank. The mean Lysholm score was 90 (85-100), and all of them have continued to engage in sporting activities. In all patients the Lachman test was with the firm stop compared to the other leg. X-ray changes in the patella were found in 2 patients, who had multifragmentary fractures of the patella. Disruption of the knee extensor apparatus, after harvesting the central third of the patellar tendon for a bone-tendon-bone autograft, can be prevented by avoiding to take too much bone graft, by using the most precise tools for cutting, while rehabilitation must be carefully planned. The optimal treatment disruption of the knee extensor apparatus after the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is a operative reconstruction, which allows continuation of the rehabilitation program.","","adolescent; adult; adverse effects; anterior cruciate ligament; bone transplantation; female; Fractures, Bone; human; injuries; Lysholm score; male; patella; patella ligament; rupture; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Grafting; Female; Humans; Lysholm Knee Score; Male; Patella; Patellar Ligament; Rupture; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0354950X","","","24298733","English","Acta Chir Iugosl","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945257463"

From August 2011 to November 2011, 25 patients with ACL injuries were treated with arthroscopic reconstruction of ACL using hamstring tendon. There were 19 males and 6 females, with a mean age of (26.26 +/- 9.53) years (ranged, 16 to 50 years). Fifteen patients had injuries in left knees, and 10 patients had injuries in right knees. The duration of the disease ranged from 1 to 60 d, with a mean of 9.6 d. All patients with acute injuries had swelling and pain on the knee, and anterior drawer test showed positive results in 14 cases, Lachman test showed positive results in 17 cases. Among patients with old injuries, 5 patients had knee joint pain, 5 patients had unstability of knee joint, 5 patients had positive results of anterior drawer test, and 5 patients had positive results of Lachman test. The diagnosis of ACL injury was determined by the anterior drawer test and Lachman test. There were 20 patients with acute injuries and 5 patients with old injuries. MRI was performed in all patients to confirm the diagnosis of ACL injuries and provide additional information on meniscal and other ligament injuries. Preservation of the remnants was through patellar tendon portal using meniscus suture guide. The femoral tunnel was placed at lateral femoral condyle at 2:00 or 10:00 position through the anteromedial (AM) portal with the knee flexed to 120 degree using an offset guide (DePuy Mitek). The tibia tunnel was placed at the center of the ACL remnant through the AM portal using a tibia guide set 45 degree. The AM and PL bundles were rotated by rotating the positioning tool to achieve the desired positions of the bundles and were fixed by femoral Intrafix and tibia Bio-Intrafix fixation. The anterior drawer test, Lachman test and Lysholm scores were observed to determinate the function of the knee and the activity of the patients. All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 12 to 18 months. The Lysholm scores improved from preoperative 34.08 +/- 7.60 (25 to 49 scores) to 94.52 +/- 2.86 (89 to 98 scores) at the follow-up time (t = 21.29, P < 0.01). No postoperative complications such as synovitis, ligament rupture and movement restriction occurred. Intrafix fixation and remnants preservation in single-tunnel double-bundle reconstruction of ACL with anatomical placement of hamstring tendons is simple, effective, useful, reproducible, and gives a satisfactory short-term results.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; female; human; internal fixator; knee; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; plastic surgery; tendon; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Internal Fixators; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons; Young Adult","","","","","","","","C.M.

BACKGROUND: Despite the extensive body of literature involving persons following ACLR, no study has comprehensively evaluated measures of strength, lower extremity kinematics, and functional performance of functional hop tests in this population. METHODS: The subjects were 22 men (mean ± SD age, 28.8 ± 11.2 years) who had ACLR using a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft 6 to 9 (7.01 ± 0.93) months previously and 22 healthy male controls (age, 24.8 ± 9.1 years). Participants completed a self-report questionnaire and underwent isokinetic strength testing and functional and kinematic assessment of the single-, triple-, and crossover-hop tests. Two-way analyses of variance were used to test for differences between the ACLR group and the control group, and between the 2 lower extremities of the ACLR group. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the ACLR group had greater isokinetic knee extension torque deficits at all speeds (P≤.001) and greater performance asymmetry for all 3 hop tests (P<.001). Compared to the noninvolved lower extremity, the involved lower extremity of the ACLR group exhibited less ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion in the phases of propulsion (P≤.014) and landing (P≤.032). When compared to the control group, the involved lower extremity exhibited less ankle dorsiflexion in the propulsion phase (P<.001) but higher hip flexion in the landing phase (P = .014). CONCLUSION: Six to 9 months following ACLR, patients continue to demonstrate functional hop and isokinetic knee extension deficits, as well as kinematic differences, during the propulsion and landing phases of the hop tests.

Computer-assisted navigation systems (CANS) have been developed to improve the accuracy of tunnel positioning. Hypothesis: The use of a CANS for ACL reconstruction decreases the rate of failure, defined as IKDC grade C or D, compared to conventional ACL reconstruction. Materials and methods: This prospective multicentre observational non-randomised open study compared two groups of patients requiring arthroscopic ACL reconstruction: one group was managed with a CANS and the other (control group) without a CANS. The primary evaluation criterion was based on the subjective and objective IKDC scores. Inclusion criteria were age older than 18. years and first ACL reconstruction procedure using autologous semitendinosus and gracilis tendons or an autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. Of the 272 included patients, 214 were analysed; 100 were in the control group and 114 in the CANS group. Results: No significant between-group differences were found for the fraction of patients having an IKDC grade A or B (P= 0.953), the subjective IKDC score (P= 0.77), differential knee laxity at 150. N (1.38 ± 1.79 mm in the control group and 1.77 ± 2.06mmin the CANS group, P= 0.384), graft-type, or graft positioning. Discussion: Our results establish the large-scale feasibility of computer-assisted navigation for ACL reconstruction. However, the main outcomes at 1 year showed no significant differences between patients managed with and without computer-assisted navigation. Level of evidence: III: prospective case control study. © 2012.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Computer-assisted surgery","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; application site infection; application site necrosis; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; case control study; cohort analysis; complex regional pain syndrome type I; computer assisted navigation system; computer assisted surgery; controlled study; cyclops syndrome; female; fever; gracilis flap; human; inflammation; intermethod comparison; joint laxity; knee disease; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; observational study; open study; osteoma; priority journal; prospective study; semitendinous muscle; vein thrombosis; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Knee Injuries; Logistic Models; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Pain Measurement; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Reference Values; Risk Assessment; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","Ministère des Affaires Sociales et de la Santé; Direction de l’hospitalisation et de l’offre de Soins, DHOS","Funding text 1: We used a prospective, observational, multicentre, comparative, non-randomised, open study design.

Few reports are available in the literature. Purpose: To report the common tear patterns and results of treatment with tendon repair and cable augmentation. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: All tendon ruptures were repaired to bone with suture anchors and augmented with a Dall-Miles cable, followed by an aggressive rehabilitation protocol. The tear location was recorded. Range of motion, strength, and subjective survey testing were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Thirteen patellar tendon ruptures were found from our database of 5364 ACL reconstructions, for an incidence of 0.24%. Seven ruptures occurred from the patellar origin medially and the tibial attachment laterally in a Z-shaped pattern. Four were completely distal, and 2 were completely proximal ruptures. All patients exhibited early flexion loss, but 11 of 13 patients maintained full, terminal hyperextension throughout treatment. The mean postoperative side-to-side flexion deficit was 33° at 1 month, 6° at 3 months, and 3° at latest follow-up at a mean of 4.8 years after tendon repair (range, 1-16 years). By International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) criteria, 10 patients had normal flexion, and 3 were nearly normal at latest follow-up. Twelve patients had normal extension, and 1 had nearly normal extension at latest follow-up. Mean isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength was 68.7% of the other side at 3 months after repair and 100.0% at latest follow-up, occurring at a mean of 47.5 months (range, 12-120 months). At a mean of 2 years (range, 1-4 years) after repair, the mean modified Noyes subjective score was 89.8 6 9.2. Conclusion: Patellar tendon ruptures are rare after ACL graft harvest. These ruptures usually occur in either a proximal-medial and distal-lateral pattern or an entirely distal pattern, in contrast to the proximal-only tear pattern commonly observed in unharvested patellar tendons. Good objective and subjective results were achieved with repair of postoperative patellar tendon ruptures using suture anchors and Dall-Miles cable augmentation, followed by aggressive, immediate range of motion exercises. © 2012 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; patellar tendon; postoperative complications; repair; rupture; tear pattern","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; orthopedic surgery; patella ligament; pathophysiology; plastic surgery; rupture; suture anchor; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Procedures; Patellar Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rupture; Suture Anchors; Young Adult","","","","","","","Benner, Rodney W., Infections and patellar tendon ruptures after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A comparison of ipsilateral and contralateral patellar tendon autografts, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 39, 3, pp. 519-525, (2011); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

Methods: This study included fifteen patients (range: 20 to 35 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction 18 to 24 months previously and a control group of 15 healthy volunteers with similar characteristics. Cases were evaluated with physical examinations, functional tests, subjective scales (Lysholm, Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score (HSSS), and Tegner activity scale) and isokinetic test. Differences between the reconstruction group and control group were analyzed. Results: Significant differences were found in the activity level of the reconstruction group (p<0.05) and in the clinical findings of the subjects with involved and uninvolved legs (p<0.05). When the reconstructed and control groups were compared according to the limb symmetry index, there were significant differences in single-leg hop test, timed hop test, shuttle run and stair hop test (p<0.05). The study also revealed a significant correlation between the vertical hop and quadriceps strength in the isokinetic test (r=0.56). When the operated knees were compared to the healthy side, mean limb symmetry index was over 92% (with two cases at 88%). When the dominant leg was compared to the non-dominant leg in the control group, the mean limb symmetry index was over 95%. Conclusion: Functional outcomes similar to those of healthy legs can be achieved following ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafting and rehabilitation. The similar functional test results of the operated and healthy subjects prove the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program. © 2012 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Functional rehabilitation; Functional tests; Isokinetic test","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comparative study; convalescence; human; injury; knee; male; pathophysiology; sport injury; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Athletic Injuries; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Recovery of Function; Young Adult","","","","","","","Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Patellar Tendon Graft Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery, (2002); Honl, Matthias, Bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: An in vitro comparison of mechanical behavior under failure tensile loading and cyclic submaximal tensile loading, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 4, pp. 549-557, (2002); Högerle, Stephan, ACL reconstruction by patellar tendon.

Multiple techniques for ACL reconstruction are available. To avoid disadvantages related to fixation devices, a hardware-free, press-fit ACL reconstruction technique was developed. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcome and osteoarthritis progression in long term after ACL reconstruction with central third patellar-tendon autograft fixed to femur by press-fit technique. Methods. Fifty two patients met inclusion/excusion criteria for this study. The patients were assessed preoperatively and at 15years after surgery with International Knee Documentation Committee Knee Ligament Evaluation Form, Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity scale and radiographs. Results: Good overall clinical outcomes and self-reported assessments were documented, and remained good at 15years. The mean Lysholm and Tegner scores improved from 59.7±18.5 and 4.2±1.0 preoperatively to 86.4±5.6 (p=0.004) and 6.9±1.4 (p=0.005) respectively at follow-up. The IKDC subjective score improved from 60.1±9.2 to 80.2±8.1 (p=0.003). According to IKDC objective score, 75% of patients had normal or nearly normal knee joints at follow-up. Grade 0 or 1 results were seen in 85% of patients on laxity testing. Degenerative changes were found in 67% of patients. There was no correlation between arthritic changes and stability of knee and subjective evaluation (p>0.05). Conclusions: ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft fixed to femur with press-fit technique allows to achieve good self-reported assessments and clinical ligament evaluation up to 15years. Advantages of the bone-patellar-tendon-bone (BPTB) press-fit fixation include unlimited bone-to-bone healing, cost effectiveness, avoidance of disadvantages associated with hardware, and ease for revision surgery. BPTB femoral press-fit fixation technique can be safely applied in clinical practice and enables patients to return to preinjury activities including high-risk sports. © 2012 Widuchowski et al.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; femoral press fit fixation; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; osteoarthritis; outcome assessment; prosthesis fixation; scoring system; self report; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Biomechanics; Bone Transplantation; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellar Ligament; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Tibia; Time Factors; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Lohmander, L.

J., Department of Radiology, Emilie de Vialar Private Hospital, Lyon, France; Dejour, David Henri, Lyon Ortho Clinic, Lyon, France","Harvesting the patellar ligament for anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions can be a source of anterior knee pain and hypoesthesia of the lateral side of the knee. We analyzed the feasibility of a minimally-invasive technique via a single patellar approach and postulate that it reduces anterior pain and limits the hypoesthesia area. Patients and methods: A prospective, comparative, non-randomized, single-center study was conducted on two groups: one undergoing surgery with the classical anteromedial approach, the other with the minimally-invasive approach. Each group included 20 patients. Both series were reviewed between the 6th and 8th month after surgery. The revision was clinical, radiological, and ultrasonographic. Results: The grafts harvested via the classical approach in all 20 cases presented good characteristics, versus eight out of 18 for the grafts harvested via the minimally-invasive approach. A prominent anterior tibial tuberosity improved the quality of the tibial bone block. A hypoesthesia zone was found in 16 cases out of 18 in the classical approach group, it measured a mean 10.3±5.6cm 2. A surface area of 3cm 2 was noted in one case from the minimally-invasive group. No significant difference was found for the subjective and objective IKDC and Lille patellofemoral scores between the two groups. Anterior pain was present in four patients in the classical group and six in the minimally-invasive group. Discussion: The minimally-invasive technique reduces the risk of cutaneous hypoesthesia. It does not prevent anterior pain related to harvesting the patellar tendon and a good-quality transplant can be obtained if the anterior tibial tuberosity is prominent.

In cases of ACL reconstruction, bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) graft or hamstring graft are frequency used. However, potential complications associated with tunnel enlargement due to soft tissue graft such as hamstring were reported. On the other hand, an altered rotational axis resulting in significantly greater translation of the lateral compartment in the single bundle compared with double bundle ACL reconstruction was reported.Method and procedure: A reconstruction procedure was modified for the ACL using a double bundle that is the combination of BTB and gracilis tendon composite autograft. Two tibial and two femoral bone tunnels are used to reconstruct two bundles of ACL; an anteromedial bundle (AMB) and a posterolateral bundle (PLB). The femoral bone tunnels are created just posterior to the resident's ridge. The tibial bone tunnels are created at the center of AM and PL tibial attachment, respectively. BTB is fixed in the AM tunnels produced on the anatomical points of tibia and femur. The gracilis graft is fixed in an anatomical PL tunnel produced. The mean width of BTB is 7 mm, since10 mm graft is sometimes not suitable for patients, especially small Asian people and females. For these patients, 10 mm graft is bigger than one third of patella tendon width.Conclusion: The devised surgical procedure based on a combination of BTB and gracilis autograft is suitable reconstruction method for patients who have small or medium width of patellar tendon such as Asian people and females. This technique is also applicable to revision surgery. © 2012 Tajima et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone patellar tendon bone graft; Double bundle reconstruction; Gracilis tendon graft; Resident's ridge","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anteromedial bundle; arthroscopic surgery; article; Asian; bone; bone graft; bone patellar tendon bone autograft; bone screw; bone tunnel; double bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; fixation device; gracilis tendon composite autograft; guide wire; human; posterolateral bundle; risk reduction; surgical technique","","","EndoButton, Smith and Nephew; FiberWire, Arthrex; Softsilk, Smith and Nephew","Smith and Nephew; Arthrex; Smith and Nephew","","","Dunn, Warren Reid, The effect of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on the risk of knee reinjury, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 32, 8, pp. 1906-1914, (2004); Granan, Lars Petter, Timing of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery and risk of cartilage lesions and meniscal tears: A cohort study based on the norwegian national knee ligament registry, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 37, 5, pp. 955-961, (2009); Yoo, Jae-chul, Increasing incidence of medial meniscal tears in nonoperatively treated anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency patients documented by serial magnetic resonance imaging studies, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 37, 8, pp. 1478-1483, (2009); Yasuda, Kazunori 1., Anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 26, 9 SUPPL. 1, pp. S21-e171, (2010); Kondo, Eiji, Prospective clinical comparisons of anatomic double-bundle versus single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction procedures in 328 consecutive patients, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 36, 9, pp. 1675-1687, (2008); Miller, Suzanne L., Graft selection in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 33, 4, pp. 675-683, (2002); Pujol, Nicolas, Anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction using a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft: A technical note, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 18, 1, pp. 43-46, (2010); Shino, Konsei, Rectangular Tunnel Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft to Mimic Natural Fiber Arrangement, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 24, 10, pp. 1178-1183, (2008); Yasuda, Kazunori 1., Clinical evaluation of anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction procedure using hamstring tendon grafts: Comparisons among 3 different procedures, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 3, pp. 240-251, (2006); Jansson, Kim A., Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the hamstring autograft and endobutton fixation technique: A clinical, radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging study with 2 years follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 5, pp. 290-295, (1999)","T.

Methods: Fifty-seven osteoarthritic knees (mean age 70 years) with a history of ACL injury underwent posterior-stabilised TKA. Intra-operative findings and results were compared with a matched control group. Results: Difficult tibial exposure and bone loss were noted in the ACL-deficient group leading to one partial patellar tendon avulsion and one femoral condylar fracture. After three years, no infections or revisions occurred. No differences were noted in ROM, IKS knee score (95∈± ∈6 versus 93∈±∈8, p∈=∈0.1), IKS function score (83∈±∈19 versus 84∈±∈16, p∈=∈0.7), or radiolucent line presence. Conclusions: Total knee arthroplasty in ACL deficient knees is effective. Difficulty obtaining tibial exposure and posteromedial tibial bone defects should be anticipated. Outcomes are comparable to standard primary TKA. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","","aged; anterior cruciate ligament injury; article; avulsion injury; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; controlled study; female; femur fracture; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; knee function; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; male; osteolysis; outcome assessment; patella fracture; patient assessment; patient safety; priority journal; range of motion; scoring system; total knee replacement; Aged; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Tibia","","","","","","","Allain, Jérôme, Macroscopic and histological assessments of the cruciate ligaments in arthrosis of the knee, Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica, 72, 3, pp. 266-269, (2001); Cushner, Fred D., A quantitative histologic comparison: ACL degeneration in the osteoarthritic knee, Journal of Arthroplasty, 18, 6, pp. 687-692, (2003); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Dejour, Henri, Anterior cruciate reconstruction combined with valgus tibial osteotomy, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 299, pp. 220-228, (1994); Dejour, Henri, Arthrosis of the knee in chronic anterior laxity, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 73, 3, pp. 157-170, (1987); Dervin, Geoffrey F., Combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: Surgical technique, Orthopedics, 30, 5 SUPPL., pp. 39-41, (2007); Ewald, Frederick C., The Knee Society total knee arthroplasty roentgenographic evaluation and scoring system, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 248, pp. 9-12, (1989); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993); Hernigou, Philippe, Posterior Slope of the Tibial Implant and the Outcome of Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 86, 3, pp. 506-511, (2004); Holden, David L., Proximal tibial osteotomy in patients who are fifty years old or less.

The purpose of this study was to investigate early isokinetic muscle strength and knee function on bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) ACL reconstruction with double femoral pin fixation or interference screw technique. Methods: A prospective study was conducted from 2008 to 2009, with 48 athletes who received femoral BPTB fixation with interference screw (n = 26) or double pin (n = 22). Clinical (IKDC objective score and hop test) and isokinetic muscle strength (peak torque (PT), PT/body weight and flexion/extension rate (F/E) in 60 and 240°/s) were analyzed at 6 months of follow-up. Results: Analysis at baseline showed no differences between groups before surgery related to age, gender, associated injury, Tegner or Lysholm score; thus showing that groups were similar. During follow-up, however, there were significant differences between the two groups in some of the isokinetic muscle strength: PT/BW 60°/s (Double Pin = 200% ± 13% vs. Interference Screw = 253% ± 16% *, *P = 0. 01); F/E 60°/s (Double Pin = 89% ± 29% * vs. Interference Screw = 74% ± 12%, *P = 0. 04). No statistical differences between groups were observed on IKDC objective score, hop test and complications. Conclusion: The significant muscle strength outcome of the interference screw group found in this study gives initial evidence that this fixation technique is useful for athletes that may need accelerated rehabilitation. Early return to sports ability signaled by isokinetic muscle strength is of clinical relevance as it is one of the main goals for athletes' rehabilitation.

Between July 2007 and July 2011, 50 cases (50 knees) of ACL injury were treated with LARS in 24 cases (LARS group) and with BPTB in 26 cases (BPTB group), respectively. There was no significant difference in age, gender, time from injury to surgery, and injury reason between BPTB group and LARS group (P > 0.05). The postoperative rehabilitation protocol was performed in 2 groups. All incisions healed at the first stage. All patients were followed up 2-3 years. The results of Lachman test, anterior drawer test, and pivot shift test were negative. Screw loosening in femur and tibia occurred in 1 case of each group respectively, anterior knee pain in 2 cases of BPTB group and in 1 case of LARS group. The Lysholm and Tegner scores were significantly higher in LARS group than in BPTB group at 2 and 6 months after operation (P < 0.05); but no significant difference was found between 2 groups at 12 and 24 months (P > 0.05). The IKDC scores showed no significant difference between 2 groups at different time points after operation (P > 0.05). During follow up, KT-1000 arthrometer and knee stability showed significant differences in antedisplacements of the tibia between 2 groups at all time points after operation (P < 0.05). LARS has less trauma and earlier functional recovery than BPTB autograft for ACL reconstruction, but the long-term effectiveness is similar.","","polyethylene terephthalate; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comparative study; convalescence; equipment; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; pathophysiology; prostheses and orthoses; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Terephthalates; Prostheses and Implants; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","polyethylene terephthalate, 25038-59-9, 60527-88-0, 9003-68-3; Polyethylene Terephthalates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10021892","","","23057343","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877298149"

Much morbidity could occur after this graft was harvested, such as the patellar tendon length change and anterior knee pain. Insall-Salvati ratio is one of the tools to determine the patella tendon length. To study the patella tendon length change after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft by using Insall-Salvati ratio. Descriptive study was conducted. Patients who were diagnosed ACL injury and underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft were included. All patients had standardized preoperative and postoperative lateral knee radiographs. The patellar tendon length, patellar height, Insall-Salvati ratio and Tegner Lysholm knee score were measured by the same person for all subjects at preoperative and 6 months postoperative period. In a series of 22 patients, the length of the patellar tendon lengthened by an average of 0.95 mm (6 mm shortening to 5 mm lengthening) or 1.82% and not statistically significant (p = 0.101). The Insall-Salvati ratio increased by 2.75% (16.32% shortening to 18.6% lengthening) which was also not statistically significant (p = 0.218). The Tegner Lysholm knee score was improved to 20.36 (5 to 45), which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The amount of the Insall-Salvati ratio change was not related to Lysholm score (p = 0.571). The present study indicated that there was no significant change of patellar tendon length after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft. No correlations with postoperative Insall-Salvati ratio and Tegner Lysholm knee score, however, the clinical results was improved in all of the patients.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; article; histology; human; injury; knee injury; male; methodology; patella ligament; rupture; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Patellar Ligament; Rupture; Young Adult","","","","","","","","N.

We made 1714 reconstructions of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee using bone-patellar tendon-bone technique, and 7 patients had fracture of the patella (0.42%). The fracture was immediately recognized in the patients with vertical non-displaced patellar fracture and the broken screw osteosynthesis was carried out without changes in the rehabilitation period. One patient was treated non-operatively and patellar fracture in four patients was treated with operative reduction and osteosynthesis. The patients were invited for the check-up 5 years (2-8 years) after surgery on average. The mean Lysholm score was 92 (85-100). All of them continued to engage in sporting activities at the same or greater level after 9 months on average (6-12 months). In all patients the Lachman test was with the firm stop compared to the other leg. X-ray changes in the patella were found in 2 patients who had multifragmentary fractures. The fracture of patella can be prevented by avoiding to take too much bone graft, by using the most precise tools for cutting, while rehabilitation must be carefully planned. The optimal treatment of the fracture of the patella after the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is a firm osteosynthesis, which allows healing of the bone and continuation of the rehabilitation program.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; fracture; human; injury; male; methodology; patella; peroperative complication; postoperative complication; radiography; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Male; Patella; Postoperative Complications; Young Adult","","","","","","","","M.

Methods: Sixty-two male adult patients undergoing primary ACLR were prospectively parallel randomized to bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BPTB), single-bundle (HT-SB) or double-bundle (HT-DB) hamstring graft. BMD (primary outcome) at the proximal tibia, distal femur, femoral neck and trochanteric region was measured blindly at day 1, 3. months, 5. months and 1. year after surgery. KT-1000, Lysholm, IKDC, one-leg hop test and Lachman test were performed blindly at baseline and 1. year post-reconstruction. Results: There was a significant bone loss at the injured knee and hip at 3 and 5. months which was reversible at the knee, but not at the hip, at 1. year post-operation. There was a significant improvement of early clinical and functional outcomes at 1. year. No significant differences in bone loss was detected among different surgical techniques, except BMD loss at the femoral neck, though a trend of greater BMD loss in the HT-SB group at 5. months after reconstruction was observed. There was a significant positive correlation between BMD at the distal femur and the single-leg hop distance at 1. year. Conclusion: In conclusion, the three surgical techniques were similar in transient bone loss at the knee region, irreversible bone loss at the hip, early clinical and functional outcomes up to 1. year post-reconstruction. BMD at the distal femur was positively associated with the single-leg hop distance at 1. year post-reconstruction. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bone mineral density; Bone-patellar tendon-bone graft; Double-bundle hamstring graft; Single-bundle hamstring graft","","","","","","","This study was supported by the equipment/resources donated by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charity Trust .

Tibial and femoral tunnel placement depends on the experience of the operating surgeon in order to achieve an isometric graft position. We performed a case series to study how often tunnel placement was adequate, as perceived by the surgeon, and if intra-operative image guidance could improve tunnel position. Over 3. years, a single surgeon and his team operated on 55 patients using single bundle patellar tendon bone or hamstring graft. The surgeon placed the guidewires where he felt they would achieve an isometric graft position. A transtibial jig was used for femoral tunnel positioning. At each step, the guidewires were checked using an image intensifier and repositioned as necessary. The number of times that the guidewire position could be improved using the image intensifier was documented. Follow up was between 1 to 3. years. The tibial guidewire was repositioned in 13 out of 55 cases and the femoral guidewire in 16 out of 55 cases. Forty-five out of 55 patients returned to their pre injury state. There were no cases of graft failure in the follow up period. The study concludes that tunnel placement is not always successful despite the surgeon's perception of adequate placement. The use of an intra-operative image intensifier can help the surgeon to achieve accurate and reproducible tunnel placement in ACL reconstruction surgery. We recommend this technique to all surgeons carrying out such procedures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Cruciate; Guided; Image; Ligament; Reconstruction","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; bone radiography; guide wire; hamstring; human; image enhancement; image intensifier; intraoperative period; major clinical study; priority journal; surgeon; surgical technique; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction; Bone Transplantation; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Intraoperative Period; Orthopedics; Postoperative Complications; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Tendons","","","","","","","Majewski, Martin, Epidemiology of athletic knee injuries: A 10-year study, Knee, 13, 3, pp. 184-188, (2006); Giuliani, Jeffrey R., Anterior cruciate ligament anatomy: a review of the anteromedial and posterolateral bundles., The journal of knee surgery, 22, 2, pp. 148-154, (2009); Howell, Stephen M., A rationale for predicting anterior cruciate graft impingement by the intercondylar roof: A magnetic resonance imaging study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 3, pp. 276-282, (1991); Moisala, Anna Stina, The effect of graft placement on the clinical outcome of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective study, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 15, 7, pp. 879-887, (2007); Sommer, Christian J., Improperly placed anterior cruciate ligament grafts: Correlation between radiological parameters and clinical results, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 8, 4, pp. 207-213, (2000); Miyatsu, Makoto, The influence of tibial tunnel site on the knee laxity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using artificial ligament, Knee, 4, 3, pp. 129-133, (1997); Khalfayan, Elias Edward, The relationship between tunnel placement and clinical results after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 3, pp. 335-341, (1996); Sudhahar, T.

We hypothesized that the volume and T2 relaxation parameters of the ACL graft measured with MRI will predict the graft structural properties and anteroposterior (AP) laxity of the reconstructed knee. Nine goats underwent ACL reconstruction using a patellar tendon autograft augmented with a collagen or collagen-platelet composite. After 6 weeks of healing, the animals were euthanized, and the reconstructed knees were retrieved and imaged on a 3T scanner. AP laxity was measured prior to dissecting out the femur-graft-tibia constructs which were then tested to tensile failure to determine the structural properties. Regression analysis indicated a statistically significant relationship between the graft volume and the failure load (r2=0.502; p=0.049). When graft volume was normalized to the T2 relaxation time, the relationship was even greater (r2=0.687; p=0.011). There was a significant correlation between the graft volume and the linear stiffness (r2=0.847; p<0.001), which remained significant with T2 normalization (r2=0.764; p=0.002). For AP laxity at 30° flexion, there was not a significant correlation with graft volume, but there was a significant correlation with volume normalized by the T2 relaxation time (r2=0.512; p=0.046).

Parallel placement of screw is difficult in transtibially drilled femoral tunnel but always desired as it affects pullout strength of the graft. Commonly, interference screw into the femoral tunnel is inserted through the anteromedial (AM) or accessory AM portal. These portals are not-in-line with the transtibially drilled femoral tunnel. Furthermore, these portals increase the divergence of the interference screw in the femoral tunnel. We hypothesized that interference screw placement through patellar tendon (PT) portal (through donor defect) in transtibially drilled femoral tunnel can be less divergent. We report the prospective randomized study to investigate the difference of divergence of interference screw placed through PT portal and AM portal and its clinical relevance. Materials and Methods : Forty-one patients underwent femoral tunnel B-PT-B graft fixation through AM portal (group 1) and other 41 (group 2) through PT portal. Femoral tunnel-interference screw divergence was measured on postoperative digital lateral X-rays. Ha′s method was used to grade divergence. The clinical outcome was assessed by postoperative intervention knee documentation committee grading (IKDC) and Lysholm score at 2 years followup. Results: Mean tunnel-screw divergence in sagittal plane through AM portal was 13.38 o (95% CI: 12.34-14.41) and through PT portal was 7.20 o (95% CI: 6.25-8.16) (P<0.0001). In AM portal group, 82.9% patients had divergence in either grade 3 or 4 category, whereas in PT portal group, 82.9% patients were in grade 1 or 2 category (P<0.0001). Mean Lysholm score were 92.8 and 94.5 at two-year follow-up in both groups which were statistically not significant. The International knee documentation committee grades of patients in both groups were similar and had no statistical significance. Conclusion: Femoral interference screw placement through the PT portal leads to significantly less screw divergence as compared with screw placement through the AM portal. However, this difference in divergence is not reflected in clinical outcome.","Anterior cruciate ligament; femoral tunnel; interference screw; screw divergence","","","","","","","","DeLay, Brian S., Current practices and opinions in ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation: results of a survey of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine., The American journal of knee surgery, 14, 2, pp. 85-91, (2001); Mirza, Faisal M., Management of injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament: Results of a survey of orthopaedic surgeons in Canada, Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 10, 2, pp. 85-88, (2000); Francis, A., Anterior cruciate ligament rupture: Reconstruction surgery and rehabilitation.A nation-wide survey of current practice, Knee, 8, 1, pp. 13-18, (2001); Rodeo, Scott Alan, Tendon-healing in a bone tunnel.

The possible advantages with bioabsorbable screws are better postoperative MRI evaluations and easier revision surgery. Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome after ACL-reconstructions with BPTB-grafts fixed with metal interference screws or bioabsorbable screws 7 years postoperatively. The resorption of the bioabsorbable screws was also analyzed. Methods: Between 2000 and 2001, 41 patients with ACL deficient knees were randomized for the use of BPTB-graft fixed with either metal interference screws or bioabsorbable poly-l-lactic acid screws. This is a 7-year follow-up with clinical examinations of both groups and, MRI of the patients with bioabsorbable screws. Results: The clinical and functional results were satisfactory in both groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in any parameter measured, except for better Pivot shift results in the bioscrew group (P = 0.04). The MRI evaluation showed degradation of the bioscrews. A residual screw tract which appeared threaded was seen in the tibia in 11 of the 16 patients. There was no sign of bony ingrowth in the previous screw site in the tibia in any of the patients. Conclusion: The potential advantages of using PLLA-screws compared to metal screws are not sufficient to warrant the routine use of PLLA-screws in ACL-reconstructions.

Stability was assessed using the Lachman test and the pivot shift test. The range of motion, donor-site symptoms, Lysholm knee score, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were also recorded. In terms of stability, only 4 patients had a grade-2 laxity postoperatively, compared to all having a grade-2 or -3 laxity preoperatively. Regarding the range of motion, extension loss was <3o in 76 patients and 3o to 5o in 3, whereas flexion loss was <5o in 73 patients, 5o to 15o in 5, and 16o to 25o in one. No patient had patellar tendon rupture/shortening, patellar fracture, or patellar maltracking. The mean Lysholm knee score improved from 48 to 92 (p<0.0001); scores were excellent (>90) in 46 patients and good (83-90) in 32 patients. The overall IKDC score was grade A (normal) in 9 patients, grade B (near normal) in 66, and grade C (abnormal) in 4. Three of the latter patients had osteoarthritic changes and pain on minimal physical activity. Only one patient had a sensation of partial giving way during moderate physical activity. 20% of the patients had anterior knee pain. Outcome of ACL reconstruction using the medial third of the patellar tendon was comparable to that using the central third of the patellar tendon. In addition, there were no instances of patellar tendon rupture/shortening, patellar fracture, or patellar maltracking.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; pathophysiology; plastic surgery; tensile strength; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tensile Strength; Treatment Outcome; MLCS; MLOWN","","","","","","","","K.

Methods: The 3-dimensional computed tomography scans of 53 patients' knees (27 BPTB-SB and 26 STG-DB) were prepared and measured by 2 examiners according to their tibial and femoral tunnel positions. We evaluated these radiologic constructions and measurements by use of the Cohen κ interobserver and intraobserver coefficient for 2 observers. Patients undergoing both techniques were divided into anatomic and nonanatomic reconstructions according to the findings of Zantop and Petersen. We correlated anatomically and nonanatomically reconstructed patients with clinical outcome by the Tegner score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), and pivot-shift test in both techniques. Results: The radiologic constructions and measurements of 53 computed tomography scans were achieved with a good agreement of interobserver and intraobserver coefficients for 2 observers. We found significantly superior clinical outcome in anatomic ACL reconstructions in both techniques in terms of higher clinical scores (Tegner and International Knee Documentation Committee), higher anterior posterior stability, and less pivot shift. We observed the best outcome in anatomic STG-DB reconstructions. Conclusions: This investigation showed that better clinical results are associated with anatomic ACL reconstructions.

We analysed 41 PTB-SB and 51 STG-DB patients using the Tegner, IKDC and WOMAC scores preoperatively and at a minimum follow-up of two years. At follow-up, there was no significant difference in the clinical scores. The KT 1000 side-to-side measurement showed no significant difference between groups. The STG-DB group was significantly superior in terms of the pivot-shift sign and anterior knee pain. We conclude that the outcome of STG-DB reconstruction in the mid-term was not advantageous in terms of clinical scores and anterior-posterior laxity evaluated by the KT 1000.

Nevertheless, some patients still present residual pain and instability. Recent studies have showed that the double-bundle technique restores better natural ACL-fitting kinematics. Long-term clinical studies comparing the two surgical techniques are not frequent and there is no instrument to evaluate function and kinematics during the knee rotation in vivo. In this randomised prospective study performed on sportive people, we compare the BPTB single-bundle ACL reconstruction technique, which is the most common surgical technique performed on these patients' category, with the ACL double-bundle reconstruction technique (DB), in order to evaluate possible differences between the groups. Comparing the two groups, no statistically significant difference regarding the post-operative Lysholm score (p = 0.368) the Tegner activity scale (p = 0.519) and the arthrometric evaluation with KT-1000 (p = 0.74) have been observed. On the contrary, the IKDC evaluation showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.004) better results of the DB group. Moreover, as assessed by the Tegner activity scale, only patients of the DB group were able to return to sports at a pre-injury level. Our data suggest that the double bundle ST/G ACL reconstruction technique results into slightly better outcome than the traditional technique of single-bundle BPTB. The verification and quantification of the advantages of this technique is anticipated with future studies focusing to the accurate measurement of knee rotation during different activities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The patients were randomised (26 PT, 24 LK). Subjective knee function was classified (Lysholm, Tegner activity, IKDC scores), laxity was measured (Lachman test, Stryker laxometer), and functional ability was assessed (one-hop test).There were no significant differences between Lysholm or IKDC scores at any stage by 5. years. Significant differences were found between the groups at 2. years for Tegner activity scores, laxity and one-hop testing. By 5. years there were no significant differences. Clinical equivalence was demonstrated between the two groups for the Lysholm score and one-hop test but not for the Tegner activity score at 5. years.The use of the LK ligament has been largely abandoned due to reports of its insufficiency. Our results demonstrate that it is not as inferior as one might expect. We conclude that the results of LK ligament ACL reconstruction are as acceptable as those using PT.

[Subjects] Twenty-seven patients participated in the study: 17 had undergone reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone and 10 with a semitendinosus graft technique. The same rehabilitation protocol was used for all of the patients. Besides the patients, 18 healthy volunteers participated as a control group. [Methods] Both groups were tested for one-leg standing (eyes open and closed), static (eyes open and closed) and dynamic postural control on The Kinesthetic Ability Trainer-KAT 2000 (OWM Medical, Carlsbad, California, USA) at the 3, 6 and 12 month post-operation. Functional outcomes of the rehabilitation were evaluated by Lysholm scoring. [Results] There were no significant differences for the eyes open static stabilometry test between operated and non-operated limbs of the patients. On the other hand, there were statistically significant differences for the closed eyes static balance test between the operated and non-operated limbs at 3 and 6 months after surgery. There were significant differences for the eyes open static balance test between the 3rd and 6th, and 6th and 12th months and for the eyes closed test of non-operated limbs between the same months as well. No statistically significant differences were noted in the dynamic balance tests between the patients and the control group. Lysholm scores of the patients obtained at 6 and 12th months after surgery were significantly better than those at 3 months after surgery. Different operation techniques revealed no significant differences in any test performed at any time. [Conclusions] Performing a postoperative sportive rehabilitation including specific proprioceptive training sessions has positive effects both on clinical status and postural control of the patients.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Postural control; Rehabilitation","","","","","","","","Ageberg, Eva, Consequences of a ligament injury on neuromuscular function and relevance to rehabilitation - Using the anterior cruciate ligament-injured knee as model, Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 12, 3, pp. 205-212, (2002); Bonfim, Thátia Regina, Proprioceptive and behavior impairments in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 84, 8, pp. 1217-1223, (2003); Harrison, Elizabeth Louise, Evaluation of single-leg standing following anterior cruciate ligament surgery and rehabilitation, Physical Therapy, 74, 3, pp. 245-252, (1994); Barrack, Robert L., Proprioception in the anterior cruciate deficient knee, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 1-6, (1989); Pap, Géza, Detailed analysis of proprioception in normal and ACL-deficient knees, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 81, 5, pp. 764-768, (1999); Valeriani, Massimiliano, Clinical and neurophysiological abnormalities before and after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee, Acta Neurologica Scandinavica, 99, 5, pp. 303-307, (1999); Mattacola, Carl G., Strength, functional outcome, and postural stability after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Athletic Training, 37, 3, pp. 262-268, (2002); Lephart, Scott M., The role of proprioception in the management and rehabilitation of athletic injuries, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 1, pp. 130-137, (1997); Adachi, Nobuo, Mechanoreceptors in the anterior cruciate ligament contribute to the joint position sense, Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica, 73, 3, pp. 330-334, (2002); Birmingham, Trevor B., Effect of a neoprene sleeve on knee joint kinesthesis: Influence of different testing procedures, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 32, 2, pp. 304-308, (2000)","","","","","","","","","09155287","","","","English","J.

Relative infrequency of occurrence, heterogeneous presentation, inconsistent treatment protocols, ambiguity in the timing of surgery, post-surgical rehabilitation protocol, and paucity of literature on the subject make the situation perplexing. This study aims at the evaluation of a multi-staged protocol and determination of various factors having influence on outcome. This study included 39 patients with injury to two or more ligaments of the knee, without associated complications. Staged protocol of ligament surgery included repair or reconstruction of collaterals and corners in the initial stage, followed by reconstruction of posterior cruciate ligament (using Hamstring graft) and anterior cruciate ligament (using Bone Patellar Tendon Bone graft). Rehabilitation included two weeks of immobilization following repair/reconstruction of collaterals/corners followed by protected range of motion exercises. In final IKDC qualification, 10 knees (25.64%) were normal (A), 26 knees (66.6%) were near normal (B), 2 knees (5.1%) were abnormal (C), and 1 knee (2.56%) was severely abnormal (D). Our staged management protocol had good subjective, and objective outcomes, and nearly all patients, but two, returned to their routine activities. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Arthroscopic reconstruction; Combined ACL; Dislocated knee; Knee joint; Multi-ligament injury; PCL injury","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical article; daily life activity; female; hamstring; human; immobilization; kinesiotherapy; knee arthroplasty; knee dislocation; ligament injury; male; medical assessment; muscle graft; posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; range of motion; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Borden, Peter S., Initial assessment of the acute and chronic multiple ligament-injured knee, Sports Medicine and Arthroscopy Review, 9, 3, pp. 178-184, (2001); Magit, David P., Arthrofibrosis of the knee, Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 15, 11, pp. 682-694, (2007); Fanelli, Gregory C., The multiple-ligament injured knee: Evaluation, treatment, and results, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 21, 4, pp. 471-486, (2005); Green, N.

Most of the described techniques use pressfit fixation on either the femoral or tibial side. Therefore an arthroscopic technique was developed which achieves bone-patellar tendon-bone graft fixation by press-fit on both sides without the need for supplemental fixation material. Methods: The first consecutive 40 patients were examined clinically with a KT-1000 arthrometer and radiologically after a mean of 28.7 months (range 20-40 months) postoperatively. Results: The mean difference in side-to-side laxity was 1.3 mm (SD 2.2 mm) and the results according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were as follows: 7 A, 28 B, 5 C, 0 D. Conclusions: The presented press-fit technique avoids all complications related to the use of interference screws. It achieves primary stable fixation of the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft thereby allowing early functional rehabilitation. However, fixation strength depends on bone quality and the arthroscopic procedure is demanding. The results showed reliable stabilization of the operated knees. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Bone-patellar tendonbone graft; Knee; Press-fit technique","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; bone screw; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; movement therapy; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative care; postoperative complication; retrospective study; suture anchor; tendon transfer; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Screws; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Suture Anchors; Tendon Transfer; Young Adult","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Andersen, Henrik Nørholm, Review on tension in the natural and reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 2, 4, pp. 192-202, (1994); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Biology of ACL reconstructions: what happens to the graft?, Instructional course lectures, 45, pp. 229-233, (1996); Barber, Frank Alan, Preliminary results of an absorbable interference screw, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 5, pp. 537-548, (1995); Bernard, Manfred, Reconstruction of the proximal insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Besides the biomechanical questions bone defects are a severe problem in cases of revision. We developed a biological method with diamond cutting instruments for graft fixation with bone dowels near the native insertion. The graft is tensioned and fixed in 120° knee flexion and is self-adapting in extension. The technique has been used in a large number of cases during a prospective study with a follow-up of 10 years for patella tendon and 4 years for hamstring tendon grafts. In this investigation 124 patients with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts showed an International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score A/B in 87% after a mean follow-up of 9.6 years, a Lachman test (maximum side-to-side difference) of 138±0.93 mm and a negative pivot shift test in 91 % of the cases. Of the 147 patients with hamstring tendon grafts 89% had an IKDC score A/B after a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, a Lachman test of 1.14±0.76 mm and no pivot shift in 90% of the cases. The Tegner activity score decreased by-1.8 in both groups. Conclusion: This method allows a reliable biological press-fit fixation for every kind of graft near the original point of insertion, preventing bone defects, allowing early intensive rehabilitation and low costs. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Bottom to top; Diamond instruments; Knee; Press-fit; Self-adapting","diamond; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; equipment design; female; follow up; human; injury; instrumentation; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee injury; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative complication; prospective study; prostheses and orthoses; surgical instrument; suture anchor; tendon transfer; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Diamond; Equipment Design; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Prostheses and Implants; Range of Motion, Articular; Surgical Instruments; Suture Anchors; Tendon Transfer; Young Adult","","diamond, 7782-40-3; Diamond, 7782-40-3","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Al-Husseiny, Moustafa, Press-fit fixation in reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament, using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 2, pp. 104-109, (2004); Boszotta, Harald, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft in press-fit technique: Surgical technique and follow-up, Arthroscopy, 13, 3, pp. 332-339, (1997); Deehan, David John, Endoscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with an ipsilateral patellar tendon autograft, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 82, 7, pp. 984-991, (2000); Arthroskopie, (1999); Osteosynth Internat, (2000); Arthroskopi Sche Gelenkchirurgie Gestern Heute Morgen Standortbestimmung, (2002); Dgooc, (2004); Felmet, Gernot, Implant-free press-fit fixation for bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction: 10-Year results, Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, 130, 8, pp. 985-992, (2010); Arthroskopie, (1997)","G.

In1987 an implant-free press-fit fixation technique of a BTB graft from the medial side of the patellar tendon (via mini-arthrotomy) was introduced and first published during the 4th ESKA Conference 1990 in Stockholm. Special emphasis is given to the anatomical orientation of the BTB graft. During the inside-out femoral press-fit fixation the bone-ligament margin of the graft is placed directly into the femoral insertion line of the natural ACL adapting its double-bundle structure. The graft is fixed by press-fit within the tibial metaphysis and its ligamentous part is secured in the metaphysis by harvested cancellous bone blocks driven into the joint line from the outside. The postoperative regime includes weight-bearing as tolerated and free motion. Out of 159 patients 95 could be seen for follow-up after an average of 10.7 years. The final IKDC knee score revealed 22.1% in group A (very good) and 62.1% in group B (good). The Tegner activity level was 6.8 preinjury and 6.0 postoperatively. The average KT 1,000 side-to-side difference was 1.8 mm. Subjectively no patient complained of instability and 99% of the patients could kneel on hard ground with minimal or no complaints. ACL revision surgery due to graft failure was not necessary in any of the patients. Advantages of the described procedure are a narrow anatomical orientation including the double bundle structure of the ACL, rapid graft incorporation by bone-to-bone healing, lack of bone resorption at the graft-host interface, decreased donor site morbidity, cost-effectiveness and ease of possible revision surgery. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Double bundle; Hardware-free; Long-term results; Patellar tendon; Press-fit fixation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; patella ligament; pressure; prostheses and orthoses; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Patellar Ligament; Pressure; Prostheses and Implants; Tendons; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Ahldén, Mattias, Knee laxity measurements after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, using either bone-patellar-tendon-bone or hamstring tendon autografts, with special emphasis on comparison over time, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 17, 9, pp. 1117-1124, (2009); Kniegelenk Und Kreuzbander, (1990); Deutscher Kongress Fur Orthopadie Und Unfallchirurgie, (2009); Bernard, Manfred, Intraoperative and postoperative insertion control of ACL grafts.

Methods: A prospective study was conducted on 41 patients who underwent arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction using a BPTB graft and who were followed up for a minimum period of two years. The radiographic position of the tibial tunnel was compared with the clinical outcome using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and modified Lysholm knee scores at two years after surgery. Results: Six out of eight patients with a fair outcome based on the modified Lysholm score and five out of eight patients with an abnormal outcome based on the IKDC score had their tibial tunnel within the 10 percent to 25 percent antero-posterior width of the tibial plateau. The tibial tunnel of patients with a fair Lysholm outcome (mean 22.2 percent) was significantly anterior compared to that of those with an excellent (mean 38.1 percent) and good (mean 34.1 percent) outcome (p is less than 0.01). The analysis using the IKDC score showed a similar trend. Conclusion: Placing the tibial tunnel in the anterior 25 percent of the tibial plateau is associated with a poor knee outcome. More predictable results can be achieved through 35 percent to 46 percent anteroposterior placement of the tibial tunnel.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone-patellar tendon-bone graft; Treatment outcome","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior posterior axis; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical article; follow up; human; knee; knee function; knee radiography; outcome assessment; prediction; prospective study; tibia; tibial tunnel; Analysis of Variance; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Humans; Knee Injuries; Multivariate Analysis; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tibia; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Jones, K.

There are few data recording manifestations and MRI signal intensity changes of healthy surviving ACL grafts at different stages. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) findings of healthy ACL grafts confirmed by second arthroscopic examination. METHODS: A total of 25 patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and had a good or excellent postoperative result, including 14 cases of autogenous bone-patellar tendon-bone rafts and 11 cases of autogenous double-loop hamstring grafts. A total of 26 second arthroscopy and 28 MRI were analyzed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Among the 26 cases of second arthroscopic examinations, there were 22 cases (84.6%) of good synovialization, and the tension of the ACL grafts was normal in 23 cases (88.5%). The major postoperative MR findings of the healthy ACL autografts were low graft with longitudinal streak-increased signal intensity bands, well-preserved continuation, and taut orientation. The signal intensity of ACL grafts showed the same tendency of decrease with time after operation, but it was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The mean value of sagittal diameter of the ACL graft decreased initially, and increased gradually; the sagittal diameter of the ACL graft tended to be thicker with time after reconstruction, but this result was not significant statistically (P > 0.05).","","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; arthroscopy; article; autograft; bone graft; clinical article; hamstring; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; postoperative period","","","","","","","Moeser, Phillip M., MR imaging of anterior cruciate ligament repair, Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 13, 1, pp. 105-110, (1989); Rak, Kevin M., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Evaluation with MR imaging, Radiology, 178, 2, pp. 553-556, (1991); Howell, Stephen M., Unimpinged and impinged anterior cruciate ligament grafts: MR signal intensity measurements, Radiology, 179, 3, pp. 639-643, (1991); Maywood, Robert M., Evaluation of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using magnetic resonance imaging, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 4, pp. 523-527, (1993); Sanchis-Alfonso, Vicente, The value of MRI in the evaluation of the ACL deficient knee and in the post-operative evaluation after ACL reconstruction, European Journal of Radiology, 16, 2, pp. 126-130, (1993); Amiel, David A., The natural history of the anterior cruciate ligament autograft of patellar tendon origin, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 6, pp. 449-462, (1986); Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); Hong, Suk-joo, Postoperative MR findings of the healthy ACL grafts: Correlation with second look arthroscopy, Clinical Imaging, 29, 1, pp. 55-59, (2005); Vogl, Thomas Josef, Reconstructed anterior cruciate ligaments using patellar tendon ligament grafts: Diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced MRI in a 2-year follow-up regimen, European Radiology, 11, 8, pp. 1450-1456, (2001); Recht, Michael P., Second time around: Evaluating the postoperative anterior cruciate ligament, Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America, 8, 2, pp. 285-297, (2000)","Y.-F.

Few studies have assessed the factors involved in the development of osteoarthritis. Hypothesis: The following 10 factors will be found to be predictive of osteoarthritis: meniscectomy, chondral damage, patellar tendon grafting, age at surgery, time delay between injury and surgery, type and intensity of postsurgery sport, quadriceps strength, hamstring strength, quadriceps-to-hamstring strength ratio, and residual joint laxity. Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Fifty-six subjects with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were followed for 6 years after surgery. Assessment included KT-1000 arthrometer testing, isokinetic strength testing, a return-to-sport questionnaire, and a radiograph assessment. A discriminant analysis was performed to assess which of the 10 factors could discriminate between those patients who developed tibiofemoral and patellofemoral osteoarthritis and those who did not. Results: Five factors were found to be predictive of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. Meniscectomy (r =.72) and chondral damage (r =.41) were the strongest discriminators, followed by patellar tendon grafting (r =.37) (‡2 [7, n = 56] = 25.48; P =.001). Weak quadriceps (r =.39) and low quadriceps-to-hamstring strength ratios (r =.6) were very close discriminators (‡2 [8, n = 42] = 15.02; P =.059). For patellofemoral osteoarthritis, meniscectomy (r =.45), chondral damage (r =.75), and age at surgery (r =.65) were predictors or close predictors (‡2 [7, n = 54] = 13.30; P =.065). Conclusion: As not all 10 factors studied were predictive of osteoarthritis, the hypothesis was only partially proven. Preventing further meniscal and chondral damage in patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency is critical. Grafting using the hamstring tendons and restoration of quadriceps-to-hamstring strength balance are associated with less osteoarthritis. © 2010 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; meniscectomy; osteoarthritis; physiotherapy","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; Australia; bone patellar tendon bone graft; cohort analysis; convalescence; female; human; injury; knee injury; knee osteoarthritis; male; patient satisfaction; plastic surgery; risk factor; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patient Satisfaction; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison between medial meniscus repair, partial meniscectomy, and normal meniscus in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 307, pp. 165-173, (1994); Davies, Andrew Paul, Plain radiography in the degenerate knee.

Purpose: The objective of this trial was to investigate the effects of hamstring isokinetic training used in the early phase of the rehabilitation program on the stability, strength, symptoms, and functional outcomes of patients throughout 12 months after anterior cruciate ligament surgery. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Forty-eight men underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an ipsilateral bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. The patients were randomly assigned to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 3 weeks (group I) or to perform daily isokinetic hamstring exercises at postoperative 9 weeks (group II). The patients were evaluated monthly for the first 4 months and at the 12th month for postoperative hamstring and quadriceps strength, as well as for knee function via the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale and International Knee Documentation Committee form. Results: Hamstring isometric strength at 30° of knee flexion (at the first and second months) and concentric isokinetic strength (at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months) at the angular velocity of 60 deg/s were significantly (P <.05-.01) greater in group I compared with group II. Average scores of the Cincinnati Knee Rating Scale for symptoms were significantly (P <.05-.001) higher in group I compared with group II at all evaluation periods. Walking and stair-climbing scores at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months and squatting score at all evaluation periods were also better (P <.05-.01) in group I compared with group II. In addition, group I exhibited better (P <.01-.001) Lachman test results compared with group II for all postoperative evaluation periods. The International Knee Documentation Committee final rating scores were significantly (P <.01) greater at 2, 3, and 4 months in group I compared with group II. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that hamstring as well as quadriceps strength can be increased via early hamstring strengthening after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with no negative impact on knee function. © 2010 The Author(s).","anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; functional outcome; hamstring; isokinetic training; rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; human; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; kinesiotherapy; knee; knee injury; male; methodology; physiology; plastic surgery; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee; Knee Injuries; Male; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Barber-Westin, Sue D., Rigorous statistical reliability, validity, and responsiveness testing of the cincinnati knee rating system in 350 subjects with uninjured, injured, or anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knees, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 4, pp. 402-416, (1999); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior cruciate ligament injury rehabilitation in athletes: Biomechanical considerations, Sports Medicine, 22, 1, pp. 54-64, (1996); Beynnon, Bruce D., Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A prospective, randomized, double-blind comparison of programs administered over 2 different time intervals, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 3, pp. 347-359, (2005); Magnus Bjordal, Jan Magnus, Epidemiology of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in soccer, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 3, pp. 341-345, (1997); Cooper, Randall L., A randomised controlled trial of proprioceptive and balance training after surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Research in Sports Medicine, 13, 3, pp. 217-230, (2005); Corry, Ian S., Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Hypotheses: Painful anterior knee tendons are common among elite badminton players. The anterior knee tendons exhibit colour Doppler activity. This activity increases after a match. Painful tendons have more Doppler activity than tendons without pain. Study design: Cohort study. Methods: 72 elite badminton players were interviewed about training, pain and injuries. The participants were scanned with high-end ultrasound equipment. Colour Doppler was used to examine the tendons of 64 players before a match and 46 players after a match. Intratendinous colour Doppler flow was measured as colour fraction (CF). The tendon complex was divided into three loci: the quadriceps tendon, the proximal patellar tendon and the insertion on the tibial tuberosity. Results: Interview: Of the 72 players, 62 players had problems with 86 tendons in the lower extremity. Of these 86 tendons, 48 were the anterior knee tendons. Ultrasound: At baseline, the majority of players (87%) had colour Doppler flow in at least one scanning position. After a match, the percentage of the knee complexes involved did not change. CF increased significantly in the dominant leg at the tibial tuberosity; single players had a significantly higher CF after a match at the tibial tuberosity and in the patellar tendon both before and after a match. Painful tendons had the highest colour Doppler activity. Conclusions: Most elite badminton players had pain in the anterior knee tendons and intratendinous Doppler activity both before and after match. High levels of Doppler activity were associated with self-reported ongoing pain.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; cohort analysis; Doppler flowmetry; echography; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; pain; patella ligament; sport; vascularization; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Pain; Patellar Ligament; Racquet Sports; Ultrasonography, Doppler; Young Adult","","","","","","","Jörgensen, Uffe, Injuries in Badminton, Sports Medicine, 10, 1, pp. 59-64, (1990); Renström, Per Anders F.H., Knee pain in tennis players, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 14, 1, pp. 163-175, (1995); Chard, Michael Denis, Racquet sports--patterns of injury presenting to a sports injury clinic., British journal of sports medicine, 21, 4, pp. 150-153, (1987); Høy, Kristian W., Badminton injuries - a prospective epidemiological and socioeconomic study, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 4, pp. 276-279, (1994); Jörgensen, Uffe, Epidemiology of badminton injuries, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 8, 6, pp. 379-382, (1987); Króner, Karsten, Badminton injuries, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 3, pp. 169-172, (1990); Blazina, Martin E., Jumper's knee., The Orthopedic clinics of North America, 4, 3, pp. 665-678, (1973); Roels, J., Patellar tendinitis (jumper's knee), American Journal of Sports Medicine, 6, 6, pp. 362-368, (1978); Mariani, Pierpaolo, Jumper's knee, Italian Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, 4, 1, pp. 85-93, (1978); Fornage, Bruno D., The hypoechoic normal tendon.

Materials and methods: Between 1998 and 1999, 189 patients were operated with ACL reconstruction with BTB patellar tendon graft. In a prospective study, 148 (78%) (91M, 57F) patients could be seen for a mean follow-up of 10.3 years. All had foreign material-free press-fit and a bottom-to-top (BTT) fixation in 120° knee flexion. All patients were evaluated with detailed history, clinical examinations, radiographic examination with weight bearing which could be compared to the time of surgery in 64 (43%) patients. Laxity testing was performed in Lachman position with the Rolimeter and pivot shift. All patients were graded according to the IKDC and Tegner activity score. Results: 87% of the patients achieved an IKDC score of A/B. The subjective IKDC score was A/B in 94.6% of the subjects. The average side-to-side difference was 1.42 ± 0.88 mm for the Lachman test, 97% of the patients were rated between 0 and 2 mm. The pivot-shift test was negative in 90% and was observed with a glide in 7% of the patients. Radiological joint space narrowing was found in the medial compartment in 8 (12.4%) cases, and laterally in 9 (14.1%) cases. All these patients had partial or total meniscus resections. The patello-femoral joint space was reduced in 21 (23%) cases. The Tegner activity score changed from 6.9 pre-injury to 5.0 at the 10-year follow-up. Conclusion: The implant-free fixation of the graft with bone dowels and BTT implantation has good and excellent results after 10 years in more than 80% of the patients. Loss of the meniscus is a main factor contributing to osteoarthritis. Advantages of patellar tendon bone press-fit fixation include anatomical positioning and fast bone-to-bone healing, ease for revision surgery and cost effectiveness. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","ACL; Bone dowels; BTB patellar tendon bone; Knee; Press fit","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; follow up; human; injury; instrumentation; knee injury; knee osteoarthritis; male; methodology; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; plastic surgery; prospective study; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Al-Husseiny, Moustafa, Press-fit fixation in reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament, using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 2, pp. 104-109, (2004); Bonatus, Timothy J., Patellar fracture and avulsion of the patellar ligament complicating arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Orthopaedic Review, 20, 9, pp. 770-774, (1991); Boszotta, Harald, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft in press-fit technique: Surgical technique and follow-up, Arthroscopy, 13, 3, pp. 332-339, (1997); Boszotta, Harald, Arthroscopic reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament using BTB patellar ligament in the press-fit technique., Surgical technology international, 11, pp. 249-253, (2003); Bouchard, Claude, Fracture of the patella during rehabilitation of the knee extensor muscles following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A brief report, Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 3, 2, pp. 118-122, (1993); Châtain, Frédéric, A comparative study of medial versus lateral arthroscopic partial meniscectomy on stable knees: 10-Year minimum follow-up, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 19, 8, pp. 842-849, (2003); Christen, B., Fractures associated with patellar ligament grafts in cruciate ligament surgery, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 74, 4, pp. 617-619, (1992); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Deehan, David John, Endoscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with an ipsilateral patellar tendon autograft, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 82, 7, pp. 984-991, (2000)","G.

However, no consensus exists regarding whether adverse effects on ACL reconstruction are attributable to joint-specific laxity or are related to the severity of generalized joint laxity. We therefore asked whether knee stability and functional outcomes would be related to joint-specific laxity and would differ according to the severity of generalized joint laxity. The Beighton and Horan criteria were used to assess joint laxity in 272 subjects. All elements are added to give an overall joint laxity score ranging from 0 to 5. Knee translation did not increase in proportion to the severity of the generalized joint laxity. Patients with scores less than 4 showed similar knee stability. When all variables, including the severity of generalized joint laxity, were considered, only hyperextension of the knee independently predicted knee stability and function. In patients with knee hyperextension, a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft provided superior stability and function compared with a hamstring tendon autograft. Our data suggest knee hyperextension predicts postoperative stability and function regardless whether patients have severe generalized joint laxity. Level of Evidence: Level III, prognostic study.

The femoral posterolateral (PL) tunnel is created with an outside-in technique, with a 30° divergence between both tunnels. A single tibial tunnel is drilled, the graft is then passed through the tibial tunnel, and the bundles are separately tensioned and fixed with three bioabsorbable interference screws. The femoral AM bone block is fixed by the anteromedial portal, the tibial bone block is then fixed in an oblique manner in order to mimic the ACL orientation with the knee at 30° of flexion.

Methods: We evaluated 198 primary ACL reconstructions in 191 patients at a mean of 55.6 months postoperatively. Assessment included side-to-side comparison of range of motion, arthrometer values, presence of effusion, anterior knee pain, and numbness. Comparisons were made between QT and BQT patients and between men and women. The results were compared with data from 30 patients in a previous study who had undergone ACL reconstruction by the same surgeon (W.R.S.) with BPTB. Results: Range of motion averaged -3.2° ± 2.2° of extension to 134.3° ± 10.2° of flexion for the operative extremity compared with -3.6° ± 2.07° to 134.2° ± 10.6° for the contralateral extremity at final follow-up. KT-1000 manual maximum measurements (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) of the operative extremity averaged 0.94 mm more than those of the normal contralateral knee. When compared with BPTB autograft, the quadriceps tendon autograft showed significantly better results, with less anterior knee pain (4.56% v 26.7%), less anterior numbness (1.5% v 53.3%), a higher percentage of arthrometer measurements showing a side-to-side difference of 0 to 3 mm (88% v 68%), and better extension (mean loss, 0.55° v 2.77°). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to loss of flexion, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, presence of effusion, or number of failures. Conclusions: Central quadriceps tendon autograft, QT or BQT, produces equivalent results when compared directly with BPTB autograft in arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction. There was no difference in results between men and women with a quadriceps tendon autograft, either with or without the use of a bone plug. ACL reconstruction using quadriceps tendon autograft is an effective surgical option that reduces donor-site morbidity.

Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing computer navigation with manual operation was performed between December 2003 and April 2004. We assigned 20 patients to the computer navigation group and 20 patients to the manual navigation group. Surgery was performed by use of a patellar tendon autograft with press-fit fixation. A lateral radiograph of the knee at maximum extension was used to determine the exact position of the tibial tunnel at 4 days postoperatively. Outcomes were evaluated with International Knee Documentation Committee 2000, Tegner, and Lysholm scoring. There was an additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of tunnel placement and graft quality at the most recent follow-up, approximately 24 months after surgery. Results: The postoperative radiographs and 2-year postoperative MRI scans showed no differences between groups for tibial or femoral tunnel placement. In both groups the mean tibial tunnel placement was 46% of the maximal diameter of the tibia. There were no significant differences between groups for objective and subjective outcomes scoring. Although some qualitative differences existed between groups with respect to MRI graft appearance at 2 years, this had no correlation with overall results. Conclusions: No significant differences were found between computer-assisted and manually navigated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with regard to tunnel placement and clinical results at a mean of 2 years postoperatively.

The purpose of this study was to identify in vivo whether a more horizontal placement of the femoral tunnel (in the ten o'clock position rather than in the eleven o'clock position) can restore rotational kinematics, during highly demanding dynamic activities, in a knee in which a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had been used to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods: We evaluated ten patients in whom a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had been used to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament with the femoral tunnel in the eleven o'clock position, ten patients who had had the same procedure with the femoral tunnel in the ten o'clock position, and ten healthy controls. Kinematic data were collected while the subjects (1) descended from a stairway, made foot contact, and then pivoted 90° on the landing lower limb and (2) jumped from a platform, landed with both feet on the ground, and pivoted 90° on the right or left lower limb. The dependent variable that we examined was tibial rotation during pivoting. Results: The results demonstrated that reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with the femoral tunnel in either the ten or the eleven o'clock position successfully restored anterior tibial translation. However, both techniques resulted in tibial rotation values, during the dynamic activities evaluated, that were significantly larger than those in the intact contralateral lower limbs and those in the healthy controls. Tibial rotation did not differ significantly between the two reconstruction groups or between the healthy controls and the intact contralateral lower limbs. However, we noticed that positioning the tunnel at ten o'clock resulted in slightly decreased rotation values that may have clinical relevance but not statistical significance. Conclusions: Regardless of which of the two tested positions was utilized to fix the graft to the femur, reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament did not restore normal tibial rotation during dynamic activities.

On an average 11.5 years after ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft 56 patients were asked to answer four different questionnaires about their knee function and knee-related quality of life. Another aim was to study whether there were any correlations between clinical tests, commonly used for evaluating patients with ACL injuries, which were performed 2 years after ACL reconstruction, and patient-reported outcome in terms of knee function and knee-related quality of life on an average 9.5 years later. All patients who had unilateral BPTB ACL reconstructions were examined at 2 years and on an average 11.5 years after surgery. At 2 years one-leg hop test for distance, isokinetic muscle torque measurement, sagittal knee laxity, Lysholm knee scoring scale and Tegner activity scale were used for clinical evaluation. At the follow-up on an average 9.5 years later the patients were evaluated with knee injury osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), short form health survey (SF 36), Lysholm knee scoring scale and Tegner activity scale. The SF-36 showed that the patients had a similar health condition as an age- and gender-matched normal population in Sweden on an average 11.5 years after ACL reconstruction. There was no correlation between the results of one-leg hop test for distance, isokinetic muscle torque measurement, sagittal knee laxity evaluated 2 years after surgery and the result of KOOS (function in sport and recreation, knee-related quality of life) and SF-36 evaluated on an average 11.5 years after surgery. We also compared patients that 2 years after surgery demonstrated a side-to-side difference in anterior-posterior knee laxity of more than 3 mm with those with 3 mm or less and found no significant group differences in terms of knee function as determined with KOOS. We found no correlation between the results of KOOS and SF-36 at the long-term follow-up and the time between injury and surgery, age at surgery or gender, respectively. We conclude that there is no correlation between patient-reported knee function in sport and recreation and knee-related quality of life on an average 11.5 years after BPTP ACL reconstruction and the evaluation methods used 2 years after surgery. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; KOOS; Long-term follow-up; Outcome; SF-36","adult; age; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; convalescence; female; human; information processing; knee; longitudinal study; male; methodology; physiology; quality of life; sex difference; time; treatment outcome; Adult; Age Factors; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Quality of Life; Recovery of Function; Research Design; Sex Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Andersson, Christer A., Instrumented testing for evaluation of sagittal knee laxity, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 256, pp. 178-184, (1990); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

METHODS: A total of 513 patients with ACL injury treated with arthroscopic allogenic ACL reconstruction were selected from February 1999 to January 2008. They consisted of 324 males and 189 females, with an average age of 29 years. There were 272 cases of allogenic bone-patellar tendon-bone, 208 cases of allogenic anterior tibialis tendon, 13 cases of allogenic rectus femoris tendon, 8 cases of allogenic flexor tendon, and 12 cases of allogenic achilles tendon-bone. The function of knee joint was assessed by Lysholm knee score and IKDC score before and after transplantation. The stability and the range of motion of knee joint were assessed by Lachman test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000 testing. RESULTS: A 12-76 months follow-up was obtained. The Lyshrolm score before transplantation was significantly higher than that after transplantation (P < 0.01). The excellent and good rate of IKDC score was 92% after transplantation. Among the patients, 458 (89.2%) patients were Lachman test negative, and 462 (90%) patients were pivot shift test negative. The anterior shift of tibia after transplantation were significantly shorter than that before transplantation (P < 0.01). Some of the patients suffered from fever, and they were complete recovery after common symptomatic treatment. The rejections appeared in some patients, and they were cured after hormones treatment. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein increased in 58 cases for 2-3 days after transplantation, and dropped to normal for 14-30 days. The total activated lymphocytes and the mid-activated lymphocytes were not significantly increased in all patients. The flexor tendon allografts were stretched under arthroscopy in 2 patients. 1 patient was treated with electrothermal shrinkage, and the other patient was treated with ACL revision surgery and ACL LARS-artificial ligament reconstruction. The second operation in other patients showed that the ligaments firmly healed with good tension. Their surfaces covered with synovial membranes, and small vessels grew in them. The active bleeding of the synovial membrane could be seen after little debridement CONCLUSION: A middle- and long-term follow-up shows that the arthroscopic allogenic transplantation for ACL reconstruction has the satisfied clinical efficacy with safety.","","C reactive protein; achilles tendon; adult; allogenic ligament transplantation; allotransplantation; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior tibialis tendon; arthroscopic surgery; article; bleeding; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical assessment; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; fever; flexor tendon; follow up; functional assessment; graft rejection; hormonal therapy; human; knee function; lachman test; ligament; lymphocyte; Lysholm knee score; major clinical study; male; pivot shift test; range of motion; rectus femoris tendon; reoperation; safety; synovium; tension; tibia; treatment failure; treatment outcome","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); O'Neill, Daniel B., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A prospective randomized analysis of three techniques, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 78, 6, pp. 803-813, (1996); Prokopis, Peter M., Allograft use in ACL reconstruction, Knee, 6, 2, pp. 75-85, (1999); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Donor-site morbidity and anterior knee problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autografts, Arthroscopy, 17, 9, pp. 971-980, (2001); Thillemann, Janni Kjærgaard, Sensibility loss after ACL reconstruction with hamstring graft, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 507-511, (2008); McCarroll, John R., Fracture of the patella during a golf swing following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A case report, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 11, 1, pp. 26-27, (1983); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

Because of high incidence of ACL tearing especially in young athletes its reconstruction is very important. The aim of this study was to evaluate short-term results of anterior cruciate ligament ruptures using four strand hamstring auto graft and Bone patellar tendon autograph. Methods: The study group included 96 patients (3 female and 93 male) with ACL teared who had been referred to our center in 5 years period (2002-2007). The subject which were Accessed in this study included meniscal injury concomitant chondral injury, determine the most common cause of ACL tearing, comparision of IKDC and lysholm score in all patients before and after surgery, and limitation of rang of motion of knee post operation. Results: Involvement was in the right knee in 38 patients and in the left knee in 58 patients. Mean age of patients was 27.6 years (19-48). Mean surgical delay was 18 month (1-77). The most common cause of tear was playing soccer. Meniscal injury was in 78 patients. (Medial meniscus in 63 patients, lateral meniscus in 29 patients) Concommitent chondral injury was in 54 patients (56.25%). 68% of patients returned to preoperative functions sport activity. There was no limitation in extension and there was 6 patients limitation in flexion about 20°. In last visit of patients IKDS in class A and B was 96. Conclusion: It is seem that arthroscopic reconstruction of ACL is a safe and good method in treatment of Knee stability. Use of IKDC and lysholm score for comparision of patients before and after surgery is helpful. The operation should be done early after injury. Reconstruction of ACL in older patients in the abscense of DJD is effective.","Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Meniscal injury; Reconstruction; Rupture; Sport injury","adult; age; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comorbidity; controlled study; convalescence; female; hamstring; human; joint mobility; joint stability; knee meniscus rupture; major clinical study; male; muscle graft; patient referral; patient safety; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; range of motion; scoring system; sport; therapy delay; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Kapoor, B., Current practice in the management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the United Kingdom, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 5, pp. 542-544, (2004); Corry, Ian S., Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

The authors hypothesized that the increment of hamstring tendons strength with 6-strand graft could improve the knee stability compared to the result from using the gold standard patellar tendon. Material and Method: Thirty-four patients were prospectively randomized into two groups for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Seventeen patients underwent reconstruction with 6-strand hamstring tendons and the remaining seventeen were treated with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. Patients were followed-up under the similar rehabilitation protocol for at least 12 months. At the time of final follow-up, all the patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of patient's satisfaction, activity level, and knee stability. Results: Fifteen patients in bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (two lost to follow-up) and thirteen patients used 6-strand hamstring tendons(four were converted to 4-strand hamstring tendons) were evaluated at a mean of 19 months (range 12-31 months). The mean of KT-2000 side-to-side laxity measurement in 6-strand hamstring group (0.96 mm) is less than BPTB group (1.22 mm) significantly (p < 0.05). Eleven of 13 patients (84.62%) that received the 6-strand hamstring tendons could return to sport activities compared to 10 of 15 patients (66.67%) that received BPTB graft. Hamstring group have a lower prevalence of donor-site morbidity resulting in less difficult in kneeling. Conclusion: The authors concluded that using 6-strand hamstring tendons could improve knee stability in the early clinical outcomes. With no difference in subjective assessment, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction used hamstring tendons have less donor-site morbidity, which is more compatible to Asian life-style.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone-patellar tendon-bone graft; Patellar ligament; Reconstructive surgical procedures; Tendon transfer; Transplantation autologous","adolescent; adult; article; autograft; clinical article; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; donor site; female; follow up; hamstring; human; intermethod comparison; joint laxity; knee cruciate ligament; knee instability; ligament surgery; male; outcome assessment; patella tendon; patient satisfaction; physical activity; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation care; therapy effect; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Rosenberg, Thomas D., Extensor mechanism function after patellar tendon graft harvest for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 5, pp. 519-526, (1992); Sachs, Raymond A., Patellofemoral problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 6, pp. 760-765, (1989); Feller, Julian A., Early post-operative morbidity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Patellar tendon versus hamstring graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 9, 5, pp. 260-266, (2001); Cooley, Vernon J., Quadrupled semitendinosus anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: 5-Year results in patients without meniscus loss, Arthroscopy, 17, 8, pp. 795-800, (2001); Prodromos, Chadwick C., Stability results of hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at 2- to 8-year follow-up, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 21, 2, pp. 138-146, (2005); J Lerdsin Hosp, (2002); Markolf, Keith L., Biomechanical consequences of replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament with a patellar ligament allograft.

Several methods for graft fixation have been described. To avoid intra-articular hardware we adopt biological fixation with a femoral trapezoidal press-fit fixation. A prospective study was performed on 30 consecutive active people who underwent ACL reconstruction with this technique by two surgeons between septem-ber2004 and march2007 (mean follow-up 15.2 months). Results were evaluated by an independent examiner using radiography, subjective and objective evaluation. Assessment using the IKDC knee scoring revealed 92% of the patients with a normal or nearly normal knee joint. Lysholm's score was 63.6(40-86) preoperatively and 91.88(73-100) at the latest follow up (P < 0.005). No patient complained of instability at latest follow up. The quadriceps muscle showed mild atrophy at 3 and 6 months and at final follow-up. Five Patients complained of anterior knee pain and had a positive kneeling test. We found no graft displacement on follow up radiographs. All cases showed radiological evidence of graft osteointegration at last follow up.

Recent research suggested that the anterior curciate liga-ment (ACL) reconstruction does not restore tibial rotation to normal levels when a bone patellar tendon bone (BPTB) graft is used during high demanding activities. Our goal was to deter-mine if the usage of an alternative graft, as the quadrupled semitendinosus-gracilis (ST/G), restore tibial rotation to nor-mal values in a population of athletically active individuals while performing a usual for their sport activity. Methods. Eleven subjects, all reconstructed with an ST/G graft, were assessed in vivo, 9 months postoperatively, while they jumped off a 40 cm platform, landed on the ground and sub-sequently pivoted at 90 degrees. The evaluation period was identified from initial foot contact with the ground, included the pivoting of the ipsilateral leg, and was completed upon touch-down of the contralateral leg. By that time the patients had already returned to their sports activities. Results. The maximum range of motion of the tibial rotation for the pivoting leg, during the evaluation period was found signi-ficantly (P=0.0001) larger in the reconstructed leg as compared to the intact contralateral, although both clinical and arthro-meter assessments revealed restoration of anterior translation. Conclusion. It was concluded that ACL reconstruction with an ST/G graft does not restore tibial rotation to normal levels during this high demanding activity. It seems that new surgical techniques are needed to better replicate the actual anatomy and function of the natural ACL in order to address this problem.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone-patellar tendon-bone graft; Gait; Tibia","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; comparative study; convalescence; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee; knee injury; male; pathophysiology; physiology; prognosis; rotation; sport; sport injury; tendon; tibia; time; transplantation; treatment failure; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Prognosis; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Rotation; Sports; Tendons; Tibia; Time Factors; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Failure","","","","","","","Zarins, Bertram, Knee Injuries in Sports, New England Journal of Medicine, 318, 15, pp. 950-961, (1988); Noyes, Frank R., The symptomatic anterior cruciate-deficient knee.

Hypotheses: Women have a higher incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury to the contralateral knee after surgery than men but do not have a difference in injuries to the reconstructed knee. Young, competitive athletes have a higher incidence of injury than older patients. The time to return to full activities does not affect injury rate. Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: The authors prospectively followed 1820 patients after primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to determine if patients suffered an injury to either knee within 5 years after surgery. Subsequent injury was evaluated based on sex, age, and activity level. Results: Minimum 5-year follow-up was obtained on 1415 patients (78%). Seventy-five patients (5.3%) had an injury to the contralateral knee, and 61 patients (4.3%) suffered an injury to the reconstructed knee (P = .2185). Women suffered more injuries (7.8%) to the contralateral normal knee than men (3.7%; P < .001) but not more injuries to the reconstructed knee (4.3% vs 4.1%; P = .5543). The risk of subsequent injury to either knee was 17% for patients <18 years old, 7% for patients aged 18 to 25 years, and 4% for patients older than 25 years. There was no difference in injury rate between patients who returned before and after 6 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Women have a higher incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury to the contralateral knee than men after reconstruction. The incidence of injury to either knee after reconstruction is associated with younger age and higher activity level, but returning to full activities before 6 months postoperatively does not increase the risk of subsequent injury. © 2009 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Age; Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Patellar tendon graft; Reinjury; Risk factors; Sex","adult; age distribution; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; female; follow up; human; incidence; knee; knee injury; knee ligament injury; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; physical activity; postoperative period; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; risk assessment; sex difference; tendon graft; adolescent; age; bone transplantation; injury; middle aged; patella ligament; plastic surgery; time; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Transplantation; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Sex Factors; Time Factors; Young Adult","","","","","","","Arendt, Elizabeth Anne, Knee Injury Patterns Among Men and Women in Collegiate Basketball and Soccer: NCAA Data and Review of Literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 694-701, (1995); Arnold, Todd, A perioperative rehabilitation program for anterior cruciate ligament surgery, Physician and Sportsmedicine, 28, 1, pp. 31-44, (2000); Campbell, John D., The evolution and current treatment trends with anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, and medial collateral ligament injuries., The American journal of knee surgery, 11, 2, pp. 128-135, (1998); Davis, Thorp J., Correlation of the intercondylar notch width of the femur to the width of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 4, pp. 209-214, (1999); Dienst, Michael, Correlation of intercondylar notch cross sections to the ACL size: A high resolution MR tomographic in vivo analysis, Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, 127, 4, pp. 253-260, (2007); Kernozek, Thomas W., Gender differences in lower extremity landing mechanics caused by neuromuscular fatigue, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 36, 3, pp. 554-565, (2008); Le Gall, Franck, Injuries in young elite female soccer players: An 8-season prospective study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 36, 2, pp. 276-284, (2008); Liu, Stephen H., Primary immunolocalization of estrogen and progesterone target cells in the human anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 14, 4, pp. 526-533, (1996); Estimated Probability of Competing in Athletics Beyond the High School Interscholastic Level; Rozzi, Susan L., Knee joint laxity and neuromuscular characteristics of male and female soccer and basketball players, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 3, pp. 312-319, (1999)","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","19109531","English","Am.

In particular, we have investigated the complex interaction of the anteromedial and posterolateral bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament as well as several key biomechanical variables in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, such as graft selection and femoral tunnel placement (both of which impact knee stability). For example, both the bone-patellar tendon-bone and quadrupled hamstrings tendon autografts restored anterior stability but were insufficient in gaining rotatory stability. In a follow-up study, we have shown that a more laterally placed graft was beneficial and could improve these outcomes. Such findings led to additional investigation in which the biomechanical advantages of double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were demonstrated. However, a more laterally placed autograft at the femoral insertion of the posterolateral bundle also worked well, especially when the knee was nearly at full extension (a position in which the anterior cruciate ligament is needed most). At present, we are moving forward by obtaining in vivo kinematics data and then repeating those kinematics exactly to obtain new data with use of the robotic/ universal force-moment sensor testing system in order to gain further insight regarding the function of the anterior cruciate ligament and anterior cruciate ligament replacement grafts in vivo. In parallel, we are developing a mathematical model of the knee and validating the computational model with experimental data. The combined approach will yield new and relevant information, including the stress and strain distribution in the anterior cruciate ligament and anterior cruciate ligament grafts. This will facilitate a better understanding of the function of the anterior cruciate ligament and a scientifically based design of surgical procedures and postoperative rehabilitation protocols that will lead to better patient outcomes.

Residual anterior knee symptoms however, especially after patellar-BTB graft use, are not uncommon occurrences following ACL-reconstructions, and can downgrade patient's satisfaction. Anterior knee pain contributing factors are numerous and include injury to the saphenous nerve infrapatellar branches (SNIB) and/or histologic changes at the harvest site. We thus preferably suggest a double-incision minimal approach for the patellar transplant harvesting stage in order to prevent injury to the SNIB. Hypothesis: This technical variation decreases the risk of injury to the saphenous nerve infrapatellar branches while preserving the peritenon. Study design: Prospective controlled trial. Material and methods: Two groups were alternatively constituted in 2004: ligament reconstructions were either performed via a two-incisions approach during the first 2004 semester or via a single-incision approach during the second 2004 semester. Pain, even at a mild level, was evaluated. Patients were assessed using objective pain provocative tests and sensory assessment, a Lille University femoropattelar score, the IKDC Knee evaluation, the SF36 quality of life score in combination with radiographic and ultrasonographic investigations. Results: Forty patients were reviewed at a mean 33 months follow-up delay: 21 of these had a double-incision approach and 19 had a single-incision approach. Four patients from the double-incision sub-group and 11 from the single-incision sub-group reported anterior knee pain (p < 0.01). The knee-walking test came out normal in 11 patients from the double-incision sub-group and in three from the single-incision sub-group (p < 0.02). The Lille University patello-femoral score was 91/100, demonstrating no significant difference. At follow-up, sensory disorders were observed in 17 patients from the single-incision sub-group and in nine from the double-incision sub-group (p < 0.002). However, no statistical correlation could be established between anterior knee pains and sensorial disturbances. SF36 and IKDC objective and subjective scores were similar in both groups. Ultrasonographic findings revealed a lesser degree of patellar tendon thickening in the double-incision sub-group. However, no statistically significant differences definitely emerged between the two groups (p = 0.50). Discussion: The results of this study strongly support our main hypothesis: The double-incision approach significantly reduces the mid-term incidence of anterior knee pains after ACL-reconstructions. Additionally, this technical variation markedly decreased the occurrence of sensory disorders and the extent of hypoesthesia. We thus advocate the use of a double-incision graft harvesting technique in ACL-reconstructions using a patellar-bone-tendon-bone transplant. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction done with a double-bundle technique with use of a quadriceps tendon-bone autograft and that of a single-bundle reconstruction with use of a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft in patients with generalized ligamentous laxity. Methods: The records of sixty-one patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between June 2002 and October 2005 were evaluated. Thirty-two patients underwent a single-bundle reconstruction (group 1), and twenty-nine patients underwent a double-bundle reconstruction (group 2). Clinical outcomes were determined from data obtained before surgery and at the twenty-four-month follow-up visit. Results: Postoperatively, the mean side-to-side difference (and standard deviation) in anterior tibial translation, measured with use of a KT-2000 arthrometer, wasgreaterforgroup 1 (3.37 ± 1.76 mm; range, 1.00 to 8.00 mm) than for group 2 (2.03 ± 1.11 mm; range, 0.00 to 3.50 mm) (p = 0.02). Three patients in group 1 had a grade-1+ pivot shift, while no patient in group 2 had an abnormal pivot shift. The mean score on the Hospital for Special Surgery knee ligament questionnaire was 90.8 in group 1 and 92.1 in group 2, and the mean Lysholm score was 89.4 in group 1 and 91.1 in group 2. Conclusions: On the basis of the evaluation of ligamentous laxity measured by the KT-2000 arthrometer, a double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of a quadriceps tendon-bone autograft allows less anterior translation than does a single-bundle reconstruction with use of a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. However, we could not identify a significant difference in the functional outcome between the two techniques. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III.

Methods: Eight human cadaveric knees were sequentially tested using a robotic testing system under 4 conditions: intact, ACL deficiency, ACL deficiency with subtotal medial meniscectomy, and single-bundle ACL reconstruction using a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. Knee kinematics were measured at 0°, 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion under an anterior tibial load of 130 N and a quadriceps muscle load of 400 N. Results: Subtotal medial meniscectomy in the ACL-deficient knee significantly increased anterior and lateral tibial translations under the anterior tibial and quadriceps loads (P < .05). These kinematic changes were larger at high flexion (≥60°) than at low flexion angles. ACL reconstruction in knees with ACL deficiency and subtotal medial meniscectomy significantly reduced the increased anterior tibial translation, but could not restore anterior translation to the intact level with differences ranging from 2.6 mm at 0° to 5.5 mm at 30° of flexion. ACL reconstruction did not significantly affect the medial-lateral translation and internal-external tibial rotation in the presence of subtotal meniscectomy. Conclusions: Subtotal medial meniscectomy in knees with ACL deficiency altered knee kinematics, especially at high flexion angles. ACL reconstruction significantly reduced the increased tibial translation in knees with combined ACL deficiency and subtotal medial meniscectomy, but could not restore the knee kinematics to the intact knee level. Clinical Relevance: This study suggests that meniscus is an important secondary stabilizer against anterior and lateral tibial translations and should be preserved in the setting of ACL reconstruction for restoration of optimal knee kinematics and function. © 2009 Arthroscopy Association of North America.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Knee kinematics; Reconstruction; Subtotal medial meniscectomy","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; cadaver; female; human; in vitro study; joint mobility; kinematics; knee function; knee meniscus; male; meniscectomy; quadriceps femoris muscle; robotics; subtotal medial meniscectomy; tibia; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Biomechanics; Bone Transplantation; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Aged; Motion; Patellar Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Robotics; Transplantation, Autologous; Weight-Bearing","","","","","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R01AR055612)","","Boyd, Kevin T., Meniscus preservation; rationale, repair techniques and results, Knee, 10, 1, pp. 1-11, (2003); Fairbank, Thomas J., Knee joint changes after meniscectomy., The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1,152 cases of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with autografts performed at our institution between January 1998 and May 2007. Tubercular infection was considered to be present in the setting of recurrent negative bacterial cultures but a positive result on microscopy, culture, histopathology, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All patients underwent arthroscopic lavage and synovectomy, followed by antitubercular therapy for 12 months. Results: We identified 8 patients (0.69%) with infection. Bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was used in 1 and hamstring graft in 7. All patients were immunocompetent. The mean time from surgery to presentation was 64.4 days (range, 23 to 152 days). Aspirate fluid staining and culture for acid-fast bacilli was negative in all cases, synovial tissue culture was positive in 3, characteristic histopathology was positive in 7, and PCR was positive in 6. A mean of 1.25 surgeries (range, 1 to 2) were performed. The mean length of follow-up in our series was 43.6 months (range, 25 to 73 months), with no reinfections. The mean postoperative Lysholm knee score was 80. Conclusions: Tubercular infection as a complication after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction, though rare, should be kept in mind as a possible cause of infection in immunocompetent patients in zones endemic for tuberculosis. It should also be kept in mind in nonendemic areas, among immigrants from endemic areas, and in cases with persistent swelling and discharge, effusion with minimal inflammatory signs, and negative cultures. We recommend deoxyribonucleic acid-PCR testing for early diagnosis of tuberculosis. Arthroscopic debridement and antitubercular chemotherapy together are the mainstay of treatment.

Case report: This study reports a male 34 year-old athlete, five months after ACL reconstruction surgery. The case developed normally in accordance with the established protocol. The patient presented good control and sensory-motor stability when he suffered a supracondylar femur fracture. This fracture occurred during a jump in the physical therapy treatment. The ligament reconstruction was done with the tendon graft of the knee flexors muscles, and the fracture caused later, was reduced and stabilized with plate and screw. Ten months after open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture, the patient showed regular function in the Lysholm scale, normal range of movement and muscular force grade V for knee flexors and extensors. Discussion: Few case reports similar to the present one were found in the literature. The majority presented femur fracture after ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon. The present case shows significance by the association between supracondylar femur fracture with ligament reconstruction with flexors tendon, since only one case followed this direction. Two of the possible causes of this fracture are bone fragility for disuse and femoral tunnel bone bigger than the normal, despite not being a consensus. A hypothesis suggested by the authors of this paper is that the bone tunnel of graft fixation could have been a stress booster to the site of the fracture.","Complication; Knee; Surgery","","","","","","","","Manktelow, Andrew R.J., Late lateral femoral condyle fracture after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Patellar fracture is a rare but significant complication following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction when using a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft. The purpose of these case reports is to describe 2 cases in which patellar fracture occurred during rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction using a BPTB. Both patients were 23-year-old males referred for rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction using a BPTB autograft. They were both progressing satisfactorily in rehabilitation until sustaining a fracture of the patella. One fracture occurred during the performance of the eccentric phase of a knee extension exercise during the sixth week of rehabilitation (7 weeks postsurgery), whereas the other fracture oc-curred during testing of the patient's quadriceps maximum voluntary isometric contraction in the ninth week of rehabilitation (10 weeks postsur- gery). Both patients were subsequently treated with open reduction and internal fixation of the patella. During rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction using BPTB autograft, clinicians should consider the need to balance the sometimes-competing goals of improving quadriceps strength while providing protection to the healing graft, minimization of patellofemoral pain, and protection of the patellar donor site.","ACL; Failure; Knee; Load; Strain","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; case report; differential diagnosis; fracture; human; innervation; kinesiotherapy; knee injury; male; methodology; patella; plastic surgery; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Diagnosis, Differential; Exercise Therapy; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Patella; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Young Adult","","","","","","","Adriani, Ezio, Healing of the patellar tendon after harvesting of its mid-third for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and evolution of the unclosed donor site defect, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 3, pp. 138-143, (1995); Almazán, Arturo, Intraoperative Incidents and Complications in Primary Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 22, 11, pp. 1211-1217, (2006); Arvidsson, Inga, Isokinetic thigh muscle strength after ligament reconstruction in the knee joint: Results from a 5-10 year follow-up after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee joint, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 2, 1, pp. 7-11, (1981); Aune, Arne Kristian, Quadriceps muscle contraction protects the anterior cruciate ligament during anterior tibial translation, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 2, pp. 187-190, (1997); Benson, Eric R., A delayed transverse avulsion fracture of the superior pole of the patella after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 14, 1, pp. 85-88, (1998); Berg, Eugene E., Management of patella fractures associated with central third bone- patella tendon-bone autograft ACL reconstructions, Arthroscopy, 12, 6, pp. 756-759, (1996); Besier, Thor F., Patellofemoral joint contact area increases with knee flexion and weight-bearing, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 23, 2, pp. 345-350, (2005); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain Behavior During Rehabilitation Exercises In Vivo, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 24-34, (1995); Beynnon, Bruce D., The strain behavior of the anterior cruciate ligament during squatting and active flexion-extension.

Method: We retrospectively evaluated a case series of patients who had received arthroscopic ACL reconstructions using patellar tendon bone autograft. Fifty-four (54) ACL reconstructions were evaluated at a mean of 38 months (range 25-62 months). Clinical assessment was made using a modified Lysholm score, documentation of International Knee Documentation Committee (lΚDC), the anterior knee pain questionnaire of Shelbourne and Trumper, and by ΚΤ-Rolimeter arthrometric analysis. Radiographic assessments were also performed. Results: Arthrometric analysis showed that 51 knees (94%) were graded A or B with a median laxity of 2 mm, postoperatively. The Lysholm score improved postoperatively from 70 to 89. The patellar position in terms of congruence angle did not show any significant change, and the final shortening of the patellar tendon using the Insall-Salvati ratio was 6.07%. Only three patients complained of moderate pain on kneeling, one patient was unable to participate in strenuous works and one patient complained of harvest-site tenderness. Conclusion: It is concluded thatthe use of patellar tendon autograft with a single tibial-tubercule bone block and a strip of patellar periosteum have the advantages of being available and comparable in terms of graft size and strength and shows satisfactory results with reduced anterior knee pain. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","ACL reconstruction; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior knee pain; Arthroscopy; Patellar tendon bone autograft","adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; disease severity; female; functional assessment; functional status; human; knee pain; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; pain assessment; postoperative complication; priority journal; questionnaire; retrospective study; scoring system; surgical technique; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Transplantation; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Retrospective Studies; Tibia; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

The purposes of this study were to measure the abilities of single-bundle and anatomic double-bundle reconstructions to restore anteroposterior laxities and rotational kinematics to intact knee levels and to compare graft forces in reconstructed knees with forces in the native anterior cruciate ligament for the same loading conditions. Methods: Native anterior cruciate ligament force and tibial rotations were recorded during passive knee extension tests with and without applied tibial loads. The anteromedial and posterolateral bundles were reconstructed with patellar tendon tissue sized to fit tightly within 7-mm femoral tunnels. Testing was repeated with the anteromedial graft alone (single bundle), tensioned to restore anteroposterior laxity at 30° of flexion, and with double-bundle grafts. For double-bundle reconstructions, the anteromedial graft was first tensioned as above and then the posterolateral graft was tensioned with use of one of four protocols: posterolateral tension = anteromedial tension at 10° (DB1), posterolateral tension = anteromedial tension at 30° (DB2), posterolateral tension = (anteromedial tension + 30 N) at 10° (DB3), and posterolateral tension = (anteromedial tension + 30 N) at 30° (DB4). Results: The posterolateral graft underwent a greater length change than the anteromedial graft between 0° and 90°. This difference in elongation patterns produced high forces in the posterolateral graft at 0° when both grafts were tensioned and fixed at 30°. The mean laxities for single-bundle reconstructions were within 1.1 mm of those of the intact knee between 0° and 90°; the mean graft force at 0° was 76 N. The mean laxities for DB4 reconstructions were from 0.9 to 2.8 mm less than those of the intact knee, and the mean graft force at 0° was 264 N. Coupled internal tibial rotations from valgus moment were normal with the single-bundle graft. Internal rotations from tibial torque were approximately 2° to 4° greater than normal with a single-bundle graft. DB3 and DB4 reconstructions overcorrected the coupled tibial rotations from valgus moment and restored tibial rotations from internal torque to normal from 0° to 45°. The graft forces from tibial torque and valgus moment were normal with the single-bundle graft. The mean double-bundle graft forces at 0° were 57 N to 143 N and 34 N to 171 N greater than normal for internal torque and valgus moment, respectively. Conclusions: The single-bundle reconstruction produced graft forces, knee laxities, and coupled tibial rotations that were closest to normal. Adding a posterolateral graft to an anteromedial graft tended to reduce laxities and tibial rotations, but the reductions were accompanied by markedly higher forces in the posterolateral graft near 0° that occasionally caused it to fail during tests with internal torque or anterior tibial force. Clinical Relevance: The relatively small improvements in anteroposterior laxities and tibial rotations from adding a posterolateral graft may not be worth the high graft forces necessary to achieve them. The high forces in the posterolateral graft recorded during our tests present cause for concern and may help to explain the posterolateral graft ruptures that have been reported clinically. The need for a double-bundle reconstruction to restore anteroposterior laxity and rotatory stability is questioned.

The best series report 80 to 90% success, irrespective of the type of operation. The purpose of this work was to investigate resumption of sports activities after ACL reconstruction. We studied the impact of the conditions of sports activity after the operation, gender, type of sport, presence of an extra-articular reinforcement and time since surgery. Material and method: In order to search for significant differences between the postoperative and follow-up scores, a questionnaire with a subjective IKDC grid was addressed 12 months after their hospitalization to all athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction at the CERS from 1st January, 2003 through 31st October, 2004. Results: For the period considered, 2248 athletes were hospitalized at the CERS for ACL reconstruction. The response rate was 43% (969 responses at 12 months). There was no significant difference between the hospitalized population and the responders in terms of type of sports activity or type of graft. There was however a significant female predominance among responders (p = 0.01). Mean follow-up was 13.9 ± 2.9 months. Reconstruction methods were: hamstring graft 54%, free patellar graft 43%, MacIntosh fascia lata 2%, MacIntosh quadriceps 1%. The main activity was a pivot sport for 74% of the athletes. Male gender predominated: 77%. There was no difference regarding postoperative training, but competition level was achieved more readily by males (65% versus 54%, p = 0.0038), since more females stated resumption of competition was not an objective. It was also noted that resumption of training occurred earlier for gliding sports than for pivot-contact sports (7.32 ± 2.09 months versus 8.23 ± 2.66 months, p = 0.021). The presence of a lateral reinforcement did not have a significant impact on resumption of sports activities which was more frequent in the hamstring group than the patellar group (16% versus 7%, p < 0.0001) and more frequent in the pivot-contact sports (p = 0.0039). Regarding the role of the surgical technique, resumption of training and competition was better after hamstring plasty compared with patellar tendon plasty for follow-up less than or equal to 12 months (p = 0.0009 and 0.0001 respectively). The subjective IKDC score was also significantly better in the hamstring group for the period considered (p = 0.0006). The differences observed early in the follow-up resolved over time and no significant difference was observed at 18 and 22 months. Regarding the MacIntosh fascia lata plasty, resumption of competition was significantly earlier (7.67 ± 1.87 months) compared with hamstring plasty (9.69 ± 2.58 months) and patellar tendon plasty (9.65 ± 3 months). Resumption of training (90%) and competition (76%) was also better with the MacIntosh fascia lata plasty compared with the two other techniques but the difference was not significant. These differences, in favor of the MacIntosh fascia lata plasty, might have been due to a recruitment bias since the level of the sports activities was significantly higher in the MacIntosh population than in the populations of the other two methods. Conclusion: This study is of particular interest because of the size of the homogeneous study population resulting from the highly selective recruitment of athletes at the CERS. This study is generally in agreement with prior data in the literature, particularly concerning the rate of resumed training one year after surgery. This study shows that the patellar tendon plasty reaches maturity more slowly than the hamstring plasty although the two techniques yielded comparable results at 18 months for all criteria studied. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

There were 35 knees in 34 patients that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 57 years (50 to 66) and the mean clinical follow-up was for 72 months (25 to 173). A total of 23 knees were reconstructed with patellar tendon allograft, and 12 with patellar tendon autograft. The mean pre-operative knee extension was 1° (-5° to 10°) and flexion was 129° (125° to 150°) and at follow-up these values were 0° (-5° to 5°) and 135° (120° to 150°), respectively. Preoperatively there were 31 knees (89%) with a Lachman grade 2+ or 3+. Post-operatively, 33 knees (94%) were Lachman grade 0 or 1+. The mean pre- and post-operative International Knee Documentation Committee scores were 39 (23 to 72) and 90 (33 to 100) respectively. The mean pre- and post-operative Lysholm scores were 50 (18 to 68) and 92 (28 to 100) respectively and the mean University of California Los Angeles activity scores were 8.5 before injury (4 to 10), 4.3 (3 to 6) after injury and 8.3 (4 to 10) post-operatively. There were three graft failures (8.6%) requiring revision. We conclude that reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in carefully-selected patients aged 50 years or over can achieve similar results to those in younger patients, with no increased risk of complications. ©2008 British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery.","","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; clinical article; female; follow up; graft failure; human; knee function; male; postoperative care; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; risk reduction; tendon graft; Age Factors; Aged; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Statistics as Topic; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","undefined, (2008); Hootman, Jennifer M., Association among physical activity level, cardiorespiratory fitness, and risk of musculoskeletal injury, American Journal of Epidemiology, 154, 3, pp. 251-258, (2001); Frank, Cyril Basil, The science of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 79, 10, pp. 1556-1576, (1997); Ciccotti, Michael G., Non-operative treatment of ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament in middle-aged patients.

The best treatment of a combined rupture of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments is still unclear. Methods. Nine patients with unilateral traumatic ruptures of both the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were treated by arthroscopically-assisted simultaneous reconstruction. The operation was done using hamstring tendon and patellar tendon autografts, an average of 235 days (range 52-567) after the initial trauma. Patients were followed up for an average of 37 months (range 24-58) after surgery. For this retrospective cohort study, we used the Lysholm knee score, the Tegner activity score, and the SF-36 questionnaire as a means of assessment. Results. The evaluation at follow-up showed an average score of 74 points on the Lysholm scale. Using the IKDC evaluation, four patients could be placed in group B and five patients in group C. A significant increase, from 1.9 points before trauma to 5.0 points at follow-up, was observed on the Tegner activity score. Comparing the operated with the healthy knees, with respect to stability and isokinetic muscle strength, we noted significantly better scores in the healthy knees. Using the SF-36 questionnaire, patients showed a reduced level of physical well-being. Conclusion. The treated patients were able to carry out their activities of everyday life. However, none of them returned to their preinjury activity level. © 2008 Springer Medizin Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Knee; Knee stability; Posterior cruciate ligament","anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; cohort analysis; follow up; hamstring; human; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; knee ligament; knee ligament surgery; muscle strength; patella tendon; physical activity; postoperative period; questionnaire; retrospective study; Short Form 36; tendon graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Aged; Multiple Trauma; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Reoperation; Rupture; Tendon Transfer; Young Adult","","","","","","","Andrews, James R., Isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries: History, mechanism of injury, physical findings, and ancillary tests, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 13, 3, pp. 519-530, (1994); Boynton, Melbourne D., Long-term followup of the untreated isolated posterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 3, pp. 306-310, (1996); Sf 36 Fragebogen Zum Gesundheitszustand, (1998); Chen, Chih Hwa, Arthroscopic posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft: Results with a minimum 4-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 14, 11, pp. 1045-1054, (2006); Clancy, William G., Combined posterior cruciate ligament injuries, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 13, 3, pp. 629-647, (1994); Colosimo, Angelo J., Simultaneous ACL and PCL reconstruction., The journal of knee surgery, 16, 4, pp. 191-196, (2003); Fanelli, Gregory C., Arthroscopically assisted combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the multiple ligament injured knee: 2- to 10-Year follow-up, Arthroscopy, 18, 7, pp. 703-714, (2002); Fanelli, Gregory C., Posterior cruciate ligament injuries in trauma patients: Part II, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 5, pp. 526-529, (1995); Fanelli, Gregory C., Arthroscopically assisted combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 12, 1, pp. 5-14, (1996); Flandry, Frederick C., Analysis of subjective knee complaints using visual analog scales, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 2, pp. 112-118, (1991)","M.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of radiographic osteoarthritis in the operated knee in comparison with the contralateral knee ten years after a bone-tendon bone patellar autograft ACL-reconstruction and to evaluate to which level patients regain activity ten years after reconstruction. Methods. Fifty-three patients with ACL instability were operated arthroscopically using the central third of the patellar tendon as a bone-tendon-bone autograft. At a minimum of 10 year follow up 28/44 patients matched the inclusion criteria and could be reached for follow-up. Evaluation included a patient satisfaction evaluation using a Visual Analog Scale, physical examination (International Knee Documentation Committee score, Tegner score, Lysholm score, KT-1000 stabilometry) and a radiological evaluation (Kellgren and Fairbanks classification). Results. The patients' satisfaction, at a mean of 10,3 year follow-up, measured with a VAS score (0-10) was high with a mean of 8.5 (range 4 to 10). The KT 1000 arthrometer laxity measurements revealed in 55% of the patients an A rating (1-2 mm), in 29% a B rating (3-5 mm) and in 16% a C rating (6-10 mm). According to the Tegner score 54% of the patients were able to perform at the same activity level as pre-operatively. The mean pre-operative Tegner score was 6.8 and the mean post-operative Tegner score was 6.0 at final follow up. The Lysholm score showed satisfactory results with a mean of 91 points (range 56 to 100). According to the Kellgren and Fairbank classifications, there is a significant difference (p < 0.05) in development of OA between the ACL injured and subsequently operated knee in comparison to the contralateral knee. Conclusion. The patellar BTB ACL reconstruction does not prevent the occurrence of radiological OA after 10 years but does help the patient to regain the pre-operative level of activity. © 2008 Hart et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Am J Knee Surg, (1991); Buhl Nielsen, Allan, Epidemiology of acute knee injuries: A prospective hospital investigation, Journal of Trauma - Injury, Infection and Critical Care, 31, 12, pp. 1644-1648, (1991); Surgery, (1992); Frank, Cyril Basil, The science of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 79, 10, pp. 1556-1576, (1997); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Hypothesis: Modern arthroscopic management of an anterior cruciate ligament tear using patellar tendon autograft offers a high patient satisfaction rate and good clinical results over the long term. However, it may be associated with osteoarthritis changes over time. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: In 1992, a prospective computerized database of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was established. Since that time, 101 anterior cruciate ligament arthroscopic reconstructions performed at our institution have been observed. Inclusion criteria were as follows: reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, a minimum 10-year follow-up, a standardized operative procedure, and no previous anterior cruciate ligament repair or associated ligament lesions. Before surgery, the mean age of the patients was 28.8 years ± 8.3 (mean ± SD). The follow-up assessment was established using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 form and quantitative laxity testing with a KT-1000 arthrometer. The joint space narrowing assessment used the IKDC score with a 30° posteroanterior weightbearing view. Results: Mean follow-up was 11.6 ± 0.8 years. Nine graft ruptures occurred. The satisfaction rate was excellent (90%). Seventy patients (74%) were still actively participating in sports. The mean subjective IKDC 2000 score was 90.5 ± 8.8 points. The IKDC score was statistically correlated to laxity, time from injury, and osteoarthritis development at final follow-up. Ninety-one percent of patients were graded A or B according to the overall IKDC score. The radiological assessment reported osteoarthritis development in 17.8% of patients, and 39% showed radiological changes. Osteoarthritis was correlated with body mass index (P =.01) and age at follow-up (P =.006). In a selected population without meniscus and articular cartilage injury, an osteoarthritis rate of only 8% was found. Conclusion: Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft resulted in high patient satisfaction levels and good clinical results after 10 years. Moreover, a high percentage of patients remained involved in sports activities, and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction protected their meniscus from a secondary tear. However, knee osteoarthritis developed in 17.8% of patients so treated. © 2008 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","ACL; Arthritis; Long term; Meniscus; Patellar tendon; Reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthrometer; article; body mass; bone patellar tendon bone graft; cartilage injury; controlled study; female; follow up; human; joint cavity; knee meniscus rupture; major clinical study; male; medical assessment; osteoarthritis; patient satisfaction; priority journal; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Athletic Injuries; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kaplan-Meiers Estimate; Osteoarthritis; Prospective Studies","","","","","","","Acquitter, Y., Patellar tendon-bone autograft reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament for advanced-stage chronic anterior laxity: Is an extra-articular plasty necessary?

A total of 168 ACL reconstructions performed between July 2003 and November 2004 were reviewed. The 6-week KT-1000 manual maximum differences between the ACL-reconstructed knee and nonoperative knee were compared for patients who received ketorolac and those who did not. Mean manual maximum difference in anterior displacement was 0.6 mm in the ketorolac group and -0.6 mm in the non-ketorolac group (P=.03). When bone-patellar tendon grafts were analyzed as a separate group, mean manual maximum difference was 0.5 mm in the ketorolac group and -1.4 mm in the non-ketorolac group (P=.007). When hamstring grafts were analyzed separately, mean manual maximum difference was 0.7 mm in the ketorolac group and 0.4 mm in the non-ketorolac group (P=.59). The use of ketorolac during bone-patellar tendon autograft ACL reconstruction was associated with increased AP laxity at 6 weeks postoperatively.

A variety of posterolateral operative procedures, including primary repair, nonanatomic and anatomic graft reconstruction, augmentation, and advancement, have been described. In our experience, the majority of patients with this injury require anatomic fibular collateral ligament reconstruction and surgical restoration of the other posterolateral structures. The operative indications are at least 8 mm of increased lateral tibiofemoral compartment opening and at least 15 degrees of increased external tibial rotation on clinical examination, and 12 mm or more of lateral opening on the arthroscopic tibiofemoral gap test. A bone-patellar tendon-bone graft as a fibular collateral ligament substitute provides the cornerstone for repair or substitution of the other posterolateral structures and allows early protected knee motion to decrease the risk of arthrofibrosis. Early clinical studies show high success rates in restoration of knee stability with this operation, but longer-term investigations are required. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Anatomic; Fibular collateral ligament; Posterolateral","achilles tendon; allograft; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; athlete; bone graft; bone radiography; bone screw; femur; fibrosis; fibula; follow up; function test; human; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee ligament; ligament injury; ligament surgery; meniscal repair; outcome assessment; patella tendon; popliteal tendon; postoperative care; preoperative care; priority journal; range of motion; risk assessment; surgical technique; tendon; tendon graft; tibia; treatment contraindication; treatment indication","","","","","","","Grood, Edward S., Ligamentous and capsular restraints preventing straight medial and lateral laxity in intact human cadaver knees, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 63, 8, pp. 1257-1269, (1981); Pasque, Charles B., The role of the popliteofibular ligament and the tendon of popliteus in providing stability in the human knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 85, 2, pp. 292-298, (2003); Nielsen, Strange, Rotatory instability of cadaver knees after transection of collateral ligaments and capsule, Archives of Orthopaedic and Traumatic Surgery, 103, 3, pp. 165-169, (1984); Nielsen, Strange, The posterior cruciate ligament and rotatory knee instability - An experimental study, Archives of Orthopaedic and Traumatic Surgery, 104, 1, pp. 53-56, (1985); Gollehon, Douglas L., The role of the posterolateral and cruciate ligaments in the stability of the human knee.

The kinematics during a step-up exercise and a deep knee bend exercise was measured using a fluoroscopic technique. The patellar tendon angle (PTA) to knee flexion angle relationship during both exercises was similar for all three groups of subjects. For the UKA groups the pattern of mobile bearing movement during both exercises was similar. This study demonstrates that normal knee kinematics is achieved in the ACL deficient arthritic knee following ACLR and UKA. As a result these patients, who tend to be young and high demand, have excellent outcome and achieve high levels of function.

The central third of the patella tendon is probably the most common ACL graft material because the bone tendon bone (BTB) construct provides robust graft incorporation and a mechanically sufficient substitute. Metal and bioabsorbable interference screws ensure good initial fixation strength of the bone plug. Material and methods. A total of 78 patients (mean age 29 years) were assigned to a bioabsorbable screw [L-15 Lactosorb®] group (Group I of 34 patrients) or a metal screw group (Group II of 44 patients). Mean follow-up was 3 years. This study compared the results of ACL reconstruction using bioabsorbable and metal interference screws. Pre- and postoperative assessments included patient history, the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale and IKDC scores. Range of motion in the knee was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 12 patients from each grup. Results. Mean Lysholm scores at one year were 94.2 for Group I and 93.5 for Group II. After 3 years mean scores were 95.4 for Group I and 96.2 for Group II. A comparison of IKDC scores showed no statistically significant difference between groups. No radiographic evidence of osteolytic change or bone resorbtion around the metal screw was observed in Group II, whereas osteolytic changes around bioscrews were observed in 2 patients in Group I. There were no complications related to loss of fixation. The clinical signs of a foreign body reaction were found in one patient. Conclusions. Bioabsorbale and metal inteference screws produce equal clinical results. Complete degradation of a bioabsorbable screw takes 2-3 years. © MEDSPORTPRESS, 2008.","Interference screws; Knee joint; Ligaments reconstruction","metal; polyglycolide; polylactide; biomaterial; adult; anamnesis; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; bone graft; bone screw; controlled study; female; follow up; foreign body reaction; human; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteolysis; patella ligament reconstruction; patella tendon bone graft; postoperative care; preoperative evaluation; range of motion; scoring system; anterior cruciate ligament; bone transplantation; comparative study; methodology; patella ligament; plastic surgery; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biocompatible Materials; Bone Screws; Bone Transplantation; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Metals; Patellar Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome","","polyglycolide, 26009-03-0, 26202-08-4; polylactide, 26680-10-4; Biocompatible Materials, 0; Metals, 0","Lactosorb","","","","Burks, Robert T., Practical considerations in cruciate graft fixation, Operative Techniques in Orthopaedics, 2, 2, pp. 71-75, (1992); Alm, Anders, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by using the medial third of the patellar ligament.

It is not clear whether this potential reduction in muscle strength is progressive and related to the duration from the injury to ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible effect of the period from the injury to surgery on pre and postoperative outcomes of isokinetic muscle performance and laxity of knee in patients with anterior ACL deficiency. Patients and methods: Clinical and isokinetic assessments of 98 patients with ACL injury were evaluated preoperatively. Patients had appropriate surgical intervention with allograft achilles tendon, autograft quadriceps tendon and auto or allograft bone patellar tendon bone reconstructions. After surgery a standard rehabilitation program, accelerated rehabilitation protocol of Shelbourne, was programmed for patients. The time from the initial injury to surgery was determined and the patients were divided into groups according to the period from the injury to surgical intervention; group 1: surgery within 12 months and group 2: surgery more than 12 months. Group 2 was also subdivided into two groups group 2A: surgery within 12-36 months and group 2B: surgery more than 36 months from the injury. Also the postoperative outcomes of patients were assessed prospectively in the main groups as group 1 and 2. Isokinetic performance and KT- 1000 assessments were evaluated 1 week before and 2, 4, 6, 12 months after ACL reconstruction. All measurements were evaluated both in injured and uninjured legs and healthy legs were considered as controls. These differences between preoperative three groups were analyzed by performing one-way ANOVA and independent samples t test was used to compare the data between postoperative two groups. Results: 98 patients were included in our study. In arthrometer measurements, no significant difference was determined between groups except in KT 1000 tests between group 1 and group 2B preoperatively (p < 0.05). Also there was no significant difference between groups in flexion isokinetic performance. Preoperatively, in group 1, the difference between healthy and injured leg in extension measurements of peak torque, total work and endurance ratio was significantly lower than both group 2A and group B (p < 0.05). However preoperative analysis of group 2A and group 2B showed that these parameters did not differ significantly when surgery was performed within 12-36 months or more than 36 months from the injury. In the comparisons of groups postoperatively, lower values in these parameters on 2nd month and in endurance on 4th month remained significant after reconstruction in group 1 (p < 0.05). After 6 and 12 months, statistical significance did not remained between groups in spite of some higher deficits in lately operated patients. Conclusion: Reconstruction of ACL carried out within 12 months from the injury can minimize the strength deficit in isokinetic evaluations. Satisfactory results in isokinetic muscle performance can be achieved even with late reconstruction with appropriate rehabilitation involving especially quadriceps strengthening exercises. © 2008 IOS Press.

Methods: We retrospectively studied eighty-three patients (forty-eight men and thirty-five women) who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between June 2002 and August 2004. Of the thirty-one patients who had generalized joint laxity, twenty were managed with an autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and eleven were managed with a four-bundle hamstring (semitendinosus-gracilis tendon) graft. Of the fifty-two patients who had normal joint laxity, thirty-three were managed with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and nineteen were managed with a hamstring graft. Clinical results were evaluated by means of an examination at a minimum of twenty-four months after surgery. Results: Among the patients who had normal joint laxity, the mean side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation on testing with the KT-2000 arthrometer at a minimum of twenty-four months postoperatively was 2.7 ± 1.9 mm in the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft group and 3.5 ± 1.7 mm in the hamstring graft group. This difference was not significant. The mean Lysholm score was 91 ± 7 points in the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft group and 85 ± 10 points in the hamstring graft group (p = 0.492). The side-to-side difference in anterior translation had an inverse correlation with the Lysholm score (β = -0.604, p < 0.001). Among the patients who had excessive joint laxity, the mean side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation was 3.4 ± 1.5 mm in the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft group and 4.5 ± 2.0 mm in the hamstring graft group (p = 0.036). The mean Lysholm score was 89 ± 7 points in the bone-patellar tendon-bone group and 79 ± 12 points in the hamstring group (p = 0.015). The side-to-side difference in anterior translation had an inverse correlation with the Lysholm score (β = -0.708, p < 0.001). Conclusions: In patients who have excessive joint laxity, the two-year outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts are better than those with four-bundle hamstring grafts in terms of both side-to-side anterior laxity and clinical results.

The quadriceps tendon was introduced as a substitute graft source for bone-patellar tendon-bone. We compared the clinical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions using central quadriceps tendon-patellar bone and bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts. We selected 72 patients who underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone between 1994 and 2001 and matched for age and gender with 72 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadriceps tendon-patellar bone. All patients were followed up for more than 2 years. We assessed anterior laxity, knee function using the Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores, and quadriceps strength, the means of which were similar in the two groups. More patients (28 or 39%) in the bone-patellar tendon-bone group reported anterior knee pain than in the quadriceps tendon-patellar bone group (six patients or 8.3%). Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the central quadriceps tendon-patellar bone graft showed clinical outcomes comparable to those of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the patellar tendon graft, with anterior knee pain being less frequent in the former. Our data suggest the quadriceps tendon can be a good alternative graft choice. Level of Evidence: Level III Therapeutic study.

Methods: Between 1988 and 1998, 436 patients underwent an ACL reconstruction by a single surgeon. We analyzed all 207 patients who had a bone-patellar tendon-bone reconstruction (BPTB). The same technique was used in all operations, which consisted of the 1-incision endoscopic approach with autologous central third patellar-tendon graft. Of these patients, 196 were available for full evaluation. Evaluation included: a detailed history, physical examination, functional knee ligament testing, KT-1000 arthrometer testing, One-leg-hop testing, Lysholm score, Tegner score, and the International Knee Documentation Committee standard evaluation form. All technical surgical aspects concerning the index operation and the reoperations were collected and evaluated in detail to detect predictors for failure or improvement. Position of the graft was measured radiographically using the Amis circle and Taylor score. Results: The average age of the 196 patients at the time of the operation was 34 years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 7.4 years. Seventy-seven reoperations were performed in 54 (27.6%) patients during a period of 83 months postsurgery. Reoperations were done between day 22 and 83 months post-ACL reconstruction. Indications for reoperations were: pain caused by fixation material (n = 25); meniscal lesions (n = 24); cyclops lesion (n = 16); donor site morbidity (n = 5); re-rupture of the ACL (n = 5); posterior cruciate ligament rupture (n = 1); and a medial collateral ligament lesion (n = 1). A more ventral position of the graft on the femur (Amis <60%) was correlated with a higher frequency of meniscal lesions and cyclops lesions (P < .01). Patients who had a meniscal lesion after an ACL reconstruction had significantly lower Lysholm (P < .05) and Tegner scores (P < .01). Conclusions: A large percentage of the patients (27.6%) required additional surgical procedures after patellar tendon autograft ACL reconstruction. A poor position of the graft resulted in cyclops and meniscal lesions. Analyzing the reasons for reoperations gives information about how to improve our surgical technique.

Nevertheless, the problem of the typical donor-site-morbidity is unresolved. Recently, a transplant of quadriceps tendon, with an attached bone block (BQT) has been increasingly relied upon. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical results of a group of patients after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using either BPTB or quadriceps tendon autograft after a minimum follow-up of 2 years in terms of knee joint stability and function using both subjective and objective criteria. Retrospective study. A total of 260 patients with ACL ruptures were operated between 1995 and 2000; 124 received a BQT-autograft, including 8 revisions; 136 patients received a BPTB-autograft, exclusively primary interventions. The results were evaluated using the IKDC-, Noyes- and Lysholm-Scores. It was possible to re-evaluate 194 patients after a minimum follow-up period of 2 years, 64 of 260 patients (25%) were lost to follow-up. Ninety-seven percent of the operated knee joints in the BPTB-group were judged as normal or almost normal with the IKDC evaluation, as were 83% in the BQT-group (P ≤ 0.001). The BQT-group showed a significantly better result in the evaluation of the donor-site-morbidity. We found no significant differences in the functional outcome according to the Lysholm- and Noyes-Score. In comparison to the results after using a BQT-transplant for reconstruction of a ruptured ACL the use of the BPTB-transplant is in favour concerning patient satisfaction and IKDC evaluation. For patients with activities involving kneeling or prolonged flexion of the knee joint BQT-transplants can be a good alternative, however. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Acl rupture; Arthroscopy; Bone patellatendon bone; Bone quadriceps tendon; Reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; comparative study; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; patella ligament; pathophysiology; patient satisfaction; quadriceps femoris muscle; retrospective study; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Patient Satisfaction; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Breitfuss, H., The tendon defect after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the midthird patellar tendon-a problem for the patellofemoral joint?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 194-198, (1996); Chen, Chih Hwa, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft, Journal of Trauma - Injury, Infection and Critical Care, 46, 4, pp. 678-682, (1999); Dandy, David J., Patellar tendon length after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 76, 2, pp. 198-199, (1994); Ejerhed, Lars Erik, Patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled clinical trial. SETTING: A total 120 patients with isolated ACL injury who had received patellar tendon autograft reconstruction were randomly assigned to four groups (groups I-IV), with 30 subjects in each group. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received 16 weeks of a regular rehabilitation program and an intra-articular injection of HA or saline weekly for 3 weeks. Additionally, patients in group I received the HA commencing at 4 weeks after surgery, patients in group II at 8 weeks, and patients in group III at 12 weeks. Patients in group IV did not receive HA but did receive the same volume of normal saline as control subjects at 4 weeks after surgery. The rehabilitation program started at the same time after surgery for all groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were measured at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after reconstruction, and at follow-up 1 year later. These included the changes in Lysholm knee scoring scale, knee range of motion, ambulation speed (AS), and muscle peak torque (MPT) of knee flexion and extension. RESULTS: There were improvements in groups I-III shortly after receiving the HA, but not in the saline group (group IV). Patients in groups II and III showed more improvement in AS and MPT after rehabilitation program and at follow-up. Besides, the best results 1 year later occurred in the group receiving HA at 8 weeks after surgery (group II). CONCLUSION: HA therapy results in more functional and MPT improvement in ACL rehabilitation, and the intervention at 8 weeks after surgery results in the best outcome. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Hyaluronic acid; Reconstruction; Rehabilitation","hyaluronic acid; sodium chloride; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; autograft; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug effect; female; follow up; human; isokinetic exercise; knee function; major clinical study; male; muscle function; postoperative care; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; rating scale; rehabilitation care; scoring system; surgical patient; tendon graft; torque; treatment outcome; walking speed; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rehabilitation","","hyaluronic acid, 31799-91-4, 9004-61-9, 9067-32-7; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; Hyaluronic Acid, 9004-61-9","","","","","von Porat, Anette, High prevalence of osteoarthritis 14 years after an anterior cruciate ligament tear in male soccer players: A study of radiographic and patient relevant outcomes, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, 63, 3, pp. 269-273, (2004); Fox, Jeff A., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar autograft tendon, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 402, pp. 53-63, (2002); O'Neill, Daniel B., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A follow-up report, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 83, 9, pp. 1329-1332, (2001); Otto, David D., Five-year results of single-incision arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 26, 2, pp. 181-188, (1998); Pinczewski, Leo A., A five-year comparison of patellar tendon versus four-strand hamstring tendon autograft for arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 4, pp. 523-536, (2002); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

The present study was designed to compare postoperative changes in patellar tendon length after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between patellar tendon and hamstring tendon autograft. Magnetic resonance images of both knees (operated and healthy) and functional outcome were documented at least 1 year postoperatively in 16 patellar tendon harvested patients and in 32 hamstrings harvested patients. Patellar tendon length, patella length and Insall-Salvati ratio were measured. The operated knee values were compared to the respective values of the non-operated control knees. A significant 4.2 mm or 9.7% patellar tendon shortening in patellar tendon group and a non-significant 1.14 mm or 2.6% shortening in hamstrings group was detected. No significant difference was detected in terms of major shortening-patella baja-(6% for the patellar tendon group vs. 0% for the hamsting group). There was no significant difference in anterior knee problems between the two groups as evidenced by the Shelbourne score (94 for the patellar tendon group vs. 98 for the hamsting group). Harvesting of the patellar tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction resulted in a significant shortening of the remaining tendon. In contrast harvesting of the hamstring tendons did not affect significantly the patellar tendon length. However, the incidence of patella baja and overall functional outcome was not significantly different between the two groups. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Hamstring tendon graft; Patellar tendon graft; Patellar tendon length","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comparative study; female; follow up; histology; human; injury; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella ligament; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Adam, Frank, Length of the patellar tendon after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft: A prospective clinical study using Roentgen stereometric analysis, Arthroscopy, 18, 8, pp. 859-864, (2002); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Bernicker, J.

Type of study is biomechanical testing. An ACL reconstruction was performed on 40 cadaver porcine knees, using patellar tendon (PT) graft. Specimens were divided into four groups according to the femoral fixation: interference absorbable screw (Group A), metallic setscrew (Group B), absorbable pins (Group C), and a combination of metallic setscrew and pin (Group D). Other ten knees were used as controls. On each sample, a cyclic loading test, then a load-to-failure test were performed. Elongation after 1,000 loading cycles, ultimate failure load, yield load, stiffness, deformation at the yield point, and mode of failure were recorded. Kruskal-Wallis test and Tukey test were used to compare the differences between groups. The lowest mean elongation after 1,000 load cycles was observed for Group B (1.7 ± 1.4 mm) and D (1.2 ± 0.3 mm). Ultimate failure load of Group D (1,021.8 ± 199.4 N) was comparable with that of normal ACL (1,091.2 ± 193.3 N) and PT graft (1,140.6 ± 285.7 N). All other groups were lower than the controls. For mean stiffness, all the groups, excepting for Group D (172.8 ± 40.4 N/mm), were significantly lower than PT control group (216 ± 78.4 N/mm). Mode of failure was graft pullout for Groups A and B, distal pin breakage for Group C, and midsubstance graft rupture in 80% of the cases for Group D. Only combined compression and suspension fixation did not show significantly different structural properties in comparison with normal ACL and PT graft. Furthermore, it showed no risk of graft pullout or hardware breakdown in comparison with other fixation devices. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomechanics; Fixation; Patellar tendon","animal; animal model; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone nail; bone screw; equipment; femur; injury; materials testing; mechanical stress; patella ligament; swine; transplantation; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Nails; Bone Screws; Equipment Failure Analysis; Femur; Materials Testing; Models, Animal; Patellar Ligament; Stress, Mechanical; Swine","","","","","","","Brown, Charles H., The biomechanics of interference screw fixation of patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament grafts, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 6, pp. 880-886, (1993); Brown, Gregory Alexander, Fixation strength of interference screw fixation in bovine, young human, and elderly human cadaver knees: Influence of insertion torque, tunnel-bone block gap, and interference, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 238-244, (1996); Butler, James Clark, Optimal graft fixation—The effect of gap size and screw size on bone plug fixation in ACL reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 10, 5, pp. 524-529, (1994); Caborn, David N.M., Biomechanical comparison between BioScrew and titanium alloy interference screws for bone-patellar tendon-bone graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 13, 2, pp. 229-232, (1997); Camillieri, Gianluca, A biomechanical evaluation of transcondylar femoral fixation of anterior cruciate ligament grafts, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 32, 4, pp. 950-955, (2004); Chang, Haw Chong, Biomechanical comparison of the bioabsorbable RetroScrew System, BioScrew XtraLok with stress equalization tensioner, and 35-mm delta screws for tibialis anterior graft-tibial tunnel fixation in porcine tibiae, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 7, pp. 1057-1064, (2005); Cooper, Daniel E., The strength of the central third patellar tendon graft.

Methods: From July 1986 to March 1991, 82 patients underwent arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft. Of these, 62 returned for follow-up evaluation between November 2000 and April 2001. Four different physicians, blinded to each other's examination findings, evaluated the radiologic as well as surgical results according to the International Knee Documentation Committee criteria and the Lysholm knee scoring scale. Results: There were 47 male and 15 female patients. The mean period between injury and surgery was 16 months (range, 2 weeks to 8 years). Results of radiographs were compared with the finding of meniscal lesions during surgery and with International Knee Documentation Committee test results. A statistically significant association (P < .0001) was found between medial or lateral arthrosis of the knee and meniscal injury. In all patients the presence of tears in both menisci was associated with osteoarthrosis in both compartments (medial and lateral). Conclusions: In patients who underwent arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft who also had medial or lateral meniscectomy (or both), arthrosis of the respective compartments developed by 10 to 15 years after reconstruction. Meniscectomy was also associated with poorer results on objective tests of knee function, even with a stable knee joint.

Methods: In a consecutive series of patellar tendon autograft ACL reconstructions, all patients had both ends fixed with PLLA/β-TCP screws. Inclusion criteria were positive Lachman and pivot-shift tests and closed or nearly closed growth plates. Exclusionary criteria were posterior cruciate ligament tears and bilateral ACL or multiple ligament injuries. Tegner, Lysholm, Cincinnati, and International Knee Documentation Committee activity scores; Lachman and pivot-shift data; radiographic examinations; and KT measurements (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) were obtained. Results: In this study 41 patients met the criteria (31 male and 10 female patients), at a mean follow-up of 34 months (range, 24 to 44 months). Of these patients, 40 were available for follow-up (1 had died). Postoperatively, the mean Cincinnati score was 83 (64 preoperatively), the mean Tegner score was 5.5 (3.2 preoperatively), the mean Lysholm score was 88 (59 preoperatively), and the mean International Knee Documentation Committee activity score was 3.0 out of 4 (1.8 preoperatively). No patients had positive postoperative Lachman or pivot-shift tests. The maximum difference based on KT manual examinations 3 mm or less. Adverse events included screw breakage during insertion. Postoperative radiographs showed rapid bone plug incorporation. Radiographic tunnel obliteration with bony ingrowth was shown at 2 and 3 years' follow-up. Conclusions: The PLLA/β-TCP interference screw performed well clinically based on both subjective and objective results. Radiographic screw incorporation into the adjacent bone was apparent at 3 years.

Hypothesis: Comparable results are possible with HT and PT autografts. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: One hundred eighty ACL-deficient knees that met inclusion criteria underwent ACL reconstruction (90 HT autograft, 90 PT autograft) by one surgeon and were treated with an accelerated rehabilitation program. All knees were observed in a prospective fashion with subjective, objective, and radiographic evaluation at 2, 5, 7, and 10-year intervals. Results: At 10 years, there were no differences in graft rupture rates (7/90 PT vs. 12/90 HT, P =.24). There were 20 contralateral ACL ruptures in the PT group, compared with 9 in the HT group (P =.02). In all patients, graft rupture was associated with instrumented laxity >2 mm at 2 years (P =.001). Normal or near-normal function of the knee was reported in 97% of patients in both groups. In the PT group, harvest-site symptoms (P =.001) and kneeling pain (P =.01) were more common than in the HT group. More patients reported pain with strenuous activities in PT knees than in HT knees ( P =.05). Radiographic osteoarthritis was more common in PT knees than the HT-reconstructed knees (P =.04). The difference, however, was composed of patients with mild osteoarthritis. Other predictors of radiographic osteoarthritis were <90% single-legged hop test at 1 year and the need for further knee surgery. An ""ideal"" outcome, defined as an overall International Knee Documentation Committee grade of A or B and a radiographic grade of A at 10 years after ACL reconstruction, was associated with <3 mm of instrumented laxity at 2 years, the absence of additional surgery in the knee, and HT grafts. Conclusions: It is possible to obtain excellent results with both HT and PT autografts. We recommend HT reconstructions to our patients because of decreased harvest-site symptoms and radiographic osteoarthritis. © 2007 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","ACL reconstruction; Clinical; Hamstring tendon; Long-term; Osteoarthritis; Patellar tendon","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; hamstring; human; knee function; knee osteoarthritis; knee surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; priority journal; prospective study; radiodiagnosis; surgeon; tendon graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Knee; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis; Patellar Ligament; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Time Factors; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Knee Surgery, (1994); Aune, Arne Kristian, Four-strand hamstring tendon autograft compared with patellar tendon-bone autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomized study with two-year follow-up, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 722-728, (2001); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior cruciate ligament replacement: Comparison of bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts with two-strand hamstring grafts.

Graft used for reconstruction was either patella bone-tendon-bone (PBTB) autograft or hamstring tendon [quadrupled semitendinous and gracilis tendon (QSGT)] autograft. From March 1997 to September 2003, among 716 ACL reconstructions 209 knees (208 patients) were available for second-look arthroscopy at a mean 21.2-month (range, 14-70 months) postoperative period. The second-look arthroscopy focused on the evaluation of (1) continuity of the reconstructed ACL graft, (2) subjective graft tension using a probe, (3) the extent of synovial coverage, (4) the prevalence of cyclops or cyclops-like lesion, and (5) bony change after notchplasty. Patellar tendon autograft was used in 80 knees, hamstring tendon autograft in 129 knees. Just prior to second-look arthroscopy two objective clinical evaluations, KT-2000 arthrometer and Lysholm knee score, were performed to verify good clinical outcomes. A comparison between the hamstring tendon group and the patella tendon group, hamstring group showed slightly better results in Lysholm knee scores and KT-2000 arthrometer but there were no statistically significant differences (p>0.05). Undetected partial graft tear was seen in 21 knees (10%). With regard to graft tension, a total of 181 grafts (87%) showed normal tension and 28 (13%) showed slight lax tension. The overall synovial coverage was poor in nine (4%) knees. The synovial coverage was slightly better in the hamstring tendon group. A total of 45 knees (21.5%) showed cyclops-like lesion in variable sizes and locations. Reformation of the notch was seen in 85 knees (40%). In conclusion, the findings of second-look arthroscopy of reconstructed ACL in good clinical outcome patients showed approximately 10% partial graft tear, 5% poor synovial coverage, 20% cyclops-like lesion, and 40% some notch reformation. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions; Cyclops; Hamstring tendon autograft; Patella tendon autograft; Second-look arthroscopy; Synovial coverage","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthrometry; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; human; injury; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; postoperative complication; second look surgery; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthrometry, Articular; Arthroscopy; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Postoperative Complications; Second-Look Surgery; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Single-incision endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

Purpose: To describe an operative technique and determine the clinical outcome of a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft anatomical replacement of the fibular collateral ligament in a consecutive series of knees. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A consecutive group of knees undergoing anatomical posterolateral reconstruction that included a fibular collateral ligament reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was prospectively followed to determine the functional outcome and failure rate. Thirteen patients (14 posterolateral reconstructions) were observed 2 to 13.7 years postoperatively. All major posterolateral structures were surgically restored. The procedure represented a primary reconstruction in 7 patients and a revision in 6 patients. Anterior cruciate ligament ruptures were found in 7 patients and bicruciate ruptures in 5 patients, all of which were reconstructed. The rehabilitation protocol allowed immediate knee motion from 0° to 90° but included protection against lateral joint loads to prevent graft stretching and failure. The results were determined by a knee examination, stress radiography, KT-2000 arthrometer, the Cincinnati Knee Rating System, and the International Knee Documentation Committee Rating System. Results: Significant improvements were found at follow-up for pain (P =.0001), swelling (P =.02), patient rating of the overall knee condition (P <.001), walking (P <.05), and stair climbing (P <.05). Thirteen of the 14 (93%) reconstructions restored normal or nearly normal lateral joint opening and external tibial rotation and 1 failed. The anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were normal or nearly normal in 11 knees and abnormal in 1 knee. Conclusions: The anatomical posterolateral procedure was effective in restoring normal limits to lateral joint opening and external tibial rotation, allowed immediate knee motion, and appeared to protect other soft tissue repairs. © 2007 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Anatomical reconstruction; Fibular collateral ligament; Posterolateral","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthrometry; article; bone graft; bone remodeling; bone swelling; clinical article; controlled study; female; fibula graft; follow up; graft failure; human; human tissue; knee arthroplasty; knee ligament injury; male; motion; patella tendon; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; priority journal; prospective payment; stress radiography; surgical technique; tendon reconstruction; tissue repair; treatment duration; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Collateral Ligaments; Female; Fibula; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Reoperation; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Arciero, Robert A., Anatomic posterolateral corner knee reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 21, 9, pp. 1147-1147.e5, (2005); Barber-Westin, Sue D., Rigorous statistical reliability, validity, and responsiveness testing of the cincinnati knee rating system in 350 subjects with uninjured, injured, or anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knees, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 4, pp. 402-416, (1999); Buzzi, Roberto, Lateral collateral ligament reconstruction using a semitendinosus graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 1, pp. 36-42, (2004); Chen, Chih Hwa, Lateral collateral ligament reconstruction using quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft with bioscrew fixation, Arthroscopy, 17, 5, pp. 551-554, (2001); Chhabra, Anikar, Surgical management of knee dislocations, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 87, SUPPL. 1, pp. 1-21, (2005); Cooper, Daniel E., Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Single-Bundle Patella Tendon Graft with Tibial Inlay Fixation: 2- to 10-Year Follow-up, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 32, 2, pp. 346-360, (2004); Instr Course Lect, (1991); Covey, Capt D.C., Injuries of the posterolateral corner of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 83, 1, pp. 106-118, (2001); Dugdale, Thomas W., Preoperative planning for high tibial osteotomy: The effect of lateral tibiofemoral separation and tibiofemoral length, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 274, pp. 248-264, (1992); Fanelli, Gregory C., Arthroscopically assisted combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the multiple ligament injured knee: 2- to 10-Year follow-up, Arthroscopy, 18, 7, pp. 703-714, (2002)","S.D.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was done on 68 cases of ACL injury. ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft and interface screw fixation were performed in 26 cases (group A) and quadruple semitendinosus tendon autograft and endobutton plate fixationin in 38 cases (group B). ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft cryopreserved and interface screw fixation were performed in 4 cases (group C). There were 16 males and 10 females with an average age of 26.4 years (16-45 years) in group A, 24 males and 14 females with an average age of 24.6 years (13-48 years) in group B, and 3 males and 1 female (55-65 years) in group C. The left knee involved in 14 cases, 27 cases and 3 cases, and the right knee involved in 12 cases, 11 cases and 1 case in groups A, B and C, respectively. The disease courses were 1 week to 15 months (group A), 1 week to 16 months (group B) and 2 weeks to 28 months (group C). The intermediate myodynamic recovery, IKDC score and Lysholm score were compared among 3 groups. RESULTS: All patients were followed 12-36 months (17.5 months in group A, 18.5 months in group B and 16.5 months in group C). No intra-articular infection, phlebothrombosis of leg, vascular injury and nerve injury occurred. Lysholm scores was increased from preoperative 65.3+/-4.8 to postoperative 95.1+/-4.3 in group A, from 68.4+/-5.6 to 93.0+/-5.9 in group B and from 60.3+/-6.7 to 92.2+/-4.3 (excellent in 3 cases and good in 1 case) in group C; the excellent and good rates were 88.5% (excellent in 18 cases, good in 5 cases and fair in 3 cases) in group A, 86.8% (excellent in 28 cases, good in 5 cases and fair in 5 cases) in group B, IKDC scores were 93.7+/-3.8 (group A), 95.7+/-4.7 (group B) and 94.8+/-3.6 (group C); the knee joint functions were normal in 19 cases (73.1%), in 30 cases (78.9%) and in 3 cases, were fair in 5 cases (19.2%), in 5 cases (13.2%) and in 1 cases in groups A, B and C respectively. CONCLUSION: The transplantation of bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft , quadruple semitendinosus tendon autograft and bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft all can reconstruct and strengthen the stability of knee joint. Bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft is better selection for the ACL injury in elder and quadruple semitendinosus tendon autograft is suitable to adolescent patients with disrupted ACL.","","adolescent; adult; aged; allotransplantation; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; human; injury; knee; male; methodology; middle aged; orthopedic equipment; patella ligament; plastic surgery; retrospective study; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Fixation Devices; Patellar Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Transplantation, Homologous; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","","","","","","","Y.

Investigations included assessment of bony integration conditions regarding the use of bioabsorbable cross pins or a lateral screw for femoral graft fixation. A description of radiological parameters in contrast with IKDC findings is also given. Method: After ACL injuries, 45 patients underwent an ACL repair. For tibial tunnel placement the tibial guide was used in full knee extension. A size-specific femoral aimer was placed by using the transtibial technique in the ""over the top"" position and the tunnel was reamed with the acorn reamer to 30 mm depth. In 15 patients the BTB graft was fixed with a titanium blunt nose screw from the lateral aspect. The cross-pin technique with bioabsorbable RIGIDFIX implants was used in 30 patients. All patients underwent a follow-up study 36 month postoperatively. Geometric tests of digitised X-rays were performed. For clinical and functional outcome studies of ACL repairs the IKDC score is widely accepted. The score was modified into numeric parameters for 15 selected groups of the IKDC score. All 15 categories were rated from 1 to 4 points (Category A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1). Clinical and radiological results were statistically analysed. Results: According to the literature, tunnel placement tibial was physiological in 91% and femoral in 93% of the cases. The femoral tunnel was completely invisible in all patients. No necrosis or pathological findings in former pin holes were seen. In 24 patients the medial compartment space was smaller, but less than 50% compared to intraoperative X-rays. Even if the mean of tibial tunnel widening was 2.65 mm it was statistically not connected to the results of the IKDC score or X-ray findings of the femoral tunnel. Results in the IKDC groups and categories were seen to be in accord with overall very good and good outcomes. The modified IKDC score showed a mean of 55 points with a range from 46 as lowest (1 patient) and 60 in 4 patients (9%) as highest numeric score. Conclusion: Lateral femoral fixation with screws or bioabsorbable cross-pins shows a biological bony incorporation of a BTB graft. Tibial tunnel widening was seen but without any functional effects. Overall radiological and functional outcomes based on the IKDC score demonstrate results in favour of ACL reconstruction with BTB grafts. Due to the narrowing of the medial compartment space, more radiological outcome studies with a special emphasis on degenerative aspects have to be done. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; Bone-tendon-bone (BTB) graft; IKDC score; Tunnel placement; X-ray findings","titanium; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; article; biodegradable implant; bone necrosis; bone radiography; bone screw; clinical article; clinical examination; controlled study; femur; follow up; functional assessment; geometry; human; implant; intramedullary nailing; intraoperative period; outcome assessment; patella tendon; postoperative period; scoring system; tendon graft","","titanium, 7440-32-6","","","","","Kohn, Dieter Michael, Diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament rupture, Orthopade, 31, 8, pp. 719-730, (2002); Bauer, R., Postoperative evaluation of the position of interference screws, boneblocks and ligamentum patellae autografts in anterior cruciate ligament replacement, RoFo Fortschritte auf dem Gebiet der Rontgenstrahlen und der Bildgebenden Verfahren, 172, 6, pp. 509-513, (2000); Arthroskopie, (1998); Fremerey, Reinhard W., The role of ACL reconstruction on restitution of proprioception in chronic anterior instability of the knee - A prospective longitudinal study, Unfallchirurg, 101, 9, pp. 697-703, (1998); Pokar, Sven, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon graft.

Eccentric resistance training has the potential to induce considerable gains in muscle size and strength that could prove beneficial during postoperative rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of progressive eccentric exercise on thigh muscle structure following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods: Beginning three weeks after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, forty patients were randomly assigned to a program involving either twelve weeks of eccentric exercises or a standard rehabilitation protocol. Patients were matched by surgical procedure, sex, and age. The final series consisted of two cohorts of twenty patients each who had been treated with one of two types of graft (semitendinosus-gracilis or bone-patellar tendon-bone), with ten patients treated with each of the two rehabilitation protocols in each graft cohort. To evaluate changes in muscle structure, magnetic resonance images of the involved and uninvolved thighs were acquired before and after training. The volume and peak cross-sectional area of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gracilis and the distal portion of the gluteus maximus were calculated from these images. Results: The volume and peak cross-sectional area of the quadriceps and gluteus maximus, in both the involved and the uninvolved thighs and in the patients treated with each type of graft, improved significantly more in the eccentric-exercise group (p < 0.001). The magnitude of the volume change was more than twofold greater in that group. No significant differences in any hamstring or gracilis structural measurements were observed between the rehabilitation groups. However, the volume and peak cross-sectional area of the gracilis were markedly reduced, compared with the pretraining values, in the patients who had undergone reconstruction with the semitendinosus-gracilis graft. Conclusions: Eccentric resistance training implemented three weeks after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament can induce structural changes in the quadriceps and gluteus maximus that greatly exceed those achieved with a standard rehabilitation protocol. The success of this intervention can be attributed to the gradual and progressive exposure to negative work through eccentric exercise, ultimately leading to production of high muscle force.

We hypothesized dynamic, in vivo function of the ACL-reconstructed knee is different from the contralateral, uninjured knee and changes over time. We measured knee kinematics for 16 subjects during downhill running 5 and 12 months after ACL reconstruction (bone-patellar tendon-bone or quadrupled hamstring tendon with interference screw fixation) using a 250 frame per second stereoradiographic system. We used repeated-measures ANOVA to ascertain whether there were differences between the uninjured and reconstructed limbs and over time. We found no differences in anterior tibial translation between limbs, but reconstructed knees were more externally rotated and in more adduction (varus) during the stance phase of running. Anterior tibial translation increased from 5 to 12 months after surgery in the reconstructed knees. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction failed to restore normal rotational knee kinematics during dynamic, functional loading and some degradation of graft function occurred over time.

We asked if an alternative graft, the semitendinosus-gracilis (ST/G) tendon graft, could restore tibial rotation during a high demand activity. Owing to its anatomic similarity with the normal ACL we hypothesized the ST/G graft could restore excessive tibial rotation to normal healthy levels along with a successful reinstatement of the clinical stability of the knee. We assessed tibial rotation in vivo, using gait analysis. We compared the knees of ACL reconstructed patients with an ST/G graft to their intact contralateral and healthy controls during a pivoting task that followed a stair descent. We also evaluated knee stability after ACL reconstruction with standard clinical tests. ACL reconstruction with the ST/G graft and with current techniques did not restore tibial rotation to previous physiological levels during an activity with increased rotational loading at the knee, although abnormal anteroposterior (AP) tibial translation was restored. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; bone graft; clinical article; conference paper; controlled study; gait; gracilis flap; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; knee function; knee instability; male; muscle graft; physical activity; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; task performance; tendon graft; tibia torsion; anterior cruciate ligament; article; case control study; evaluation; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; methodology; orthopedic surgery; pathophysiology; physiology; tendon; tibia; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Case-Control Studies; Gait; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendons; Tibia; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Andriacchi, Thomas P., A study of lower-limb mechanics during stair-climbing, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 62, 5, pp. 749-757, (1980); Andriacchi, Thomas P., Interactions between kinematics and loading during walking for the normal and ACL deficient knee, Journal of Biomechanics, 38, 2, pp. 293-298, (2005); Asano, Hiroshi, Arthroscopic Evaluation of the Articular Cartilage after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Short-Term Prospective Study of 105 Patients, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 20, 5, pp. 474-481, (2004); Bush-Joseph, Charles Anthony, Dynamic function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autologous patellar tendon, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 1, pp. 36-41, (2001); Cappozzo, Aurelio, Position and orientation in space of bones during movement: Experimental artefacts, Clinical Biomechanics, 11, 2, pp. 90-100, (1996); Chambers, Henry G., A practical guide to gait analysis., The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 10, 3, pp. 222-231, (2002); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Davis, Roy B., A gait analysis data collection and reduction technique, Human Movement Science, 10, 5, pp. 575-587, (1991); Gabriel, Mary T., Distribution of in situ forces in the anterior cruciate ligament in response to rotatory loads, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 22, 1, pp. 85-89, (2004)","A.D.

Superior displacement of the patella with a palpable defect of the patellar tendon, a positive Lachman test, and an inability to perform terminal knee extension noted during the on-field examination indicated the combined injury.

However, rehabilitation after reconstruction of ACL using the multistranded hamstring is controversial. In this study, we compared the clinical results of 3-day immobilization after reconstruction of ACL using the multistranded hamstring, with those of 2-week immobilization prospectively. Methods: A total of 30 consecutive patients with ruptured ACL underwent single-socket ACL reconstruction. 10 male and 5 female patients (mean age of 29.2 ± 10.0 years) were prospectively randomized for a 3-day immobilization period, and 6 male and 9 female patients (mean age of 27.3 ± 10.9 years) were randomized for a 2-week immobilization period. We measured the anterior laxity with a KT-2000 arthrometer, joint position sense, and thigh muscle strength at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Results and conclusions: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. We concluded that the post-operative 3-day immobilization period is preferable to the longer 2-week period in our rehabilitation program from the viewpoint of psychological load to the patients and the duration of hospitalization after ACL reconstruction using multistranded hamstring tendons. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Type of Study: A 2-year prospective cohort study with assessment of patient evaluation of knee performance, clinical scoring of surgical results, and measurement of BMD in the tibia and calcaneus. Methods: Eighteen patients with a unilateral ACL rupture underwent an autogenous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft ACL reconstruction. The patients were examined before surgery and after 4, 12, and 24 months. BMD was assessed bilaterally in the proximal tibia and calcaneus using dual-photon absorptiometry and converted to a Z-score by use of BMD values from a group of healthy controls. Clinical evaluation included determination of Lysholm score, quantitative Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and the patients' self-reported highest level of activity and knee performance in sports and daily activities. Results: There were significant declines in Z-score of the proximal tibia of the operated leg during the first year after surgery, whereas there was no change in the calcaneus and contralateral leg. In the lateral tibia, the Z-score was significantly lower at 24 months follow-up, compared with both controls and the noninjured side, whereas BMD of the medial tibia had returned to near normal levels. There were significant improvements in Lysholm score, highest level of activity, and knee performance in daily activities and sports. The patients' evaluation of improvement in knee performance in sports activities at 24 months follow-up was associated with an increase in Z-score of the injured leg. Conclusions: We found a partially reversible decline in BMD of the proximal tibia after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Improvement in knee performance in sports activities was associated with an increase in BMD of the injured leg. BMD of the calcaneus remained unaffected in both legs. Level of Evidence: Level III, therapeutic case control study. © 2000 by the Arthroxcopy Association of North America.","Acl reconstruction; Bone mineral density; Calcaneus; Tibia","","","","","","","","Karlsson, Magnus Karl, Changes of bone mineral mass and soft tissue composition after hip fracture, Bone, 18, 1, pp. 19-22, (1996); Kartsson, Magnus K., Bone mineral loss after lower extremity trauma: 62 cases followed for 15-38 years, Acta Orthopaedica, 64, 3, pp. 362-364, (1993); Petersen, Michael Mørk, Bone mineral content assessed by dual photon absorptiometry in the proximal tibia: Normative data and measurements in orthopaedic conditions, European Journal of Experimental Musculoskeletal Research, 2, 3-4, pp. 121-126, (1993); Kannus, Pekka A., Effects of immobilization, three forms of remobilization, and subsequent deconditioning on bone mineral content and density in rat femora, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 11, 9, pp. 1339-1346, (1996); Zerahn, Bo, Bone loss after hip fracture is correlated to the postoperative degree of mobilisation, Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, 117, 8, pp. 453-456, (1998); Kannus, Pekka A., A cruciate ligament injury produces considerable, permanent osteoporosis in the affected knee, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 7, 12, pp. 1429-1434, (1992); Sievan̈en, Harri T., Bone mineral density and muscle strength of lower extremities after long-term strength training, subsequent knee ligament injury and rehabilitation: A unique 2-year follow-up of a 26-year-old female student, Bone, 15, 1, pp. 85-90, (1994); Järvinen, Markku J., Injury of an extremity as a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 79, 2, pp. 263-277, (1997); Zerahn, Bo, Ultrasound and BMD measurements of the os calcis in normal Danish adults, European Journal of Experimental Musculoskeletal Research, 4, 3-4, pp. 154-159, (1995); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993)","B.

Abnormal kinematics after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction have been thought to contribute to the degeneration. Hypothesis: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which was designed to restore anterior knee laxity under anterior tibial loads, does not reproduce knee kinematics under in vivo physiological loading conditions. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Both knees of 7 patients with complete unilateral rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament were magnetic resonance imaged, and 3D models were constructed from these images. The anterior cruciate ligament of the injured knee was arthroscopically reconstructed using a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. Three months after surgery, the kinematics of the intact contralateral and reconstructed knees were measured using a dual-orthogonal fluoroscopic system while the subjects performed a single-legged weightbearing lunge. The anterior laxity of both knees was measured using a KT-1000 arthrometer. Results: The anterior laxity of the reconstructed knee as measured with the arthrometer was similar to that of the intact contralateral knee. However, under weightbearing conditions, there was a statistically significant increase in anterior translation of the reconstructed knee compared with the intact knee at full extension (approximately 2.9 mm) and 15° (approximately 2.2 mm) of flexion. In addition, there was a mean increase in external tibial rotation of the anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knee beyond 30° of flexion (approximately 2° at 30° of flexion), although no statistical significance was detected. Conclusion: The data demonstrate that although anterior laxity was restored during KT-1000 arthrometer testing, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction did not restore normal knee kinematics under weightbearing loading conditions. Clinical Relevance: Future reconstruction techniques should aim to restore function of the knee under physiological loading conditions. © 2006 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; Anterior laxity; Clinical stability; In vivo kinematics; KT-1000","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone; bone graft; clinical article; controlled study; fluoroscopy; function test; human; image analysis; kinematics; knee function; knee instability; ligament surgery; measurement; medical instrumentation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; postoperative period; priority journal; rotation; three dimensional imaging; tibia; treatment outcome; weight bearing; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Postoperative Period; Recovery of Function; Rotation; Rupture; Tibia; Weight-Bearing","","","","","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R21AR051078)","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopically assisted semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft in reconstruction for acute anterior cruciate ligament injuries in athletes, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 6, pp. 726-731, (1996); Anderson, Allen F., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

We investigated whether a post-operative rehabilitation protocol including active and passive extension without any restrictions in extension immediately after an ACL reconstruction would increase the post-operative anterior-posterior knee laxity (A-P laxity). Our hypothesis was that full active and passive extension immediately after an ACL reconstruction would have no effect on the A-P laxity and clinical results up to 2 years after the operation. Twenty-two consecutive patients (14 men, 8 women, median age 21 years, range 17-41) were included. All the patients had a unilateral ACL rupture and no other ligament injuries or any other history of previous knee injuries. The surgical procedure was identical in all patients and one experienced surgeon operated on all the patients, using the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. The post-operative rehabilitation programme was identical in both groups, except for extension training during the first 4 weeks post-operatively. The patients were randomly allocated to post-operative rehabilitation programmes either allowing (Group A, n=11) or not allowing [Group B (30 to -10°), n=11] full active and passive extension immediately after the operation. They were evaluated pre-operatively and at 6 months and 2 years after the reconstruction. To evaluate the A-P knee laxity, radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and KT-1000 arthrometer (KT-1000) measurements were used, range of motion, Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation system and one-leg-hop test quotient were used. Pre-operatively, the RSA measurements revealed side-to-side differences in Group A of 8.6 mm (2.3-15.4), median (range) and in Group B of 7.2 mm (2.2-17.4) (n.s.). The corresponding KT-1000 values were for Group A, 2.0 mm (0-8.0) and Group B, 4.0 mm (0-10.0) (n.s.). At 2 years, the differences between the two groups were minimal, regardless of the method that had been used. The RSA measurements in Group A were 2.7 mm (0-10.7) and in Group B 2.8 (-1.8 to 9.5). The KT-1000 values were for Group A, 1.0 mm (-1.5 to 3.5), and for Group B, 0.5 mm (-1.0 to 4.0), without any significant differences between the groups. Nor did the Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, IKDC or one-leg-hop test differ. Early active and passive extension training, without any restrictions in extension, immediately after an ACL reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft did not increase post-operative knee laxity up to 2 years after the ACL reconstruction. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","ACL reconstruction; Extension; Radiostereometric analysis; Rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthrometry; arthroscopy; article; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; male; nonparametric test; physiology; postoperative period; time; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthrometry, Articular; Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Postoperative Period; Range of Motion, Articular; Statistics, Nonparametric; Time Factors","","","","","","","Augustsson, Jesper, Ability of a new hop test to determine functional deficits after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 5, pp. 350-356, (2004); Ballantyne, Bryon T., Influence of examiner experience and gender on interrater reliability of KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, Physical Therapy, 75, 10, pp. 898-906, (1995); Magnus Bjordal, Jan Magnus, Epidemiology of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in soccer, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 3, pp. 341-345, (1997); Bragdon, Charles R., Experimental assessment of precision and accuracy of radiostereometric analysis for the determination of polyethylene wear in a total hip replacement model, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 20, 4, pp. 688-695, (2002); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, Kinematics after tear in the anterior cruciate ligament: Dynamic bilateral radiostereometric studies in 11 patients, Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica, 72, 4, pp. 372-378, (2001); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, Kinematics and laxity of the knee joint after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Methods: From January 1999 to June 2004, we performed 330 BPTB and 96 STG procedures. Intraoperative incidents and complications were recorded for each case. Results: Our overall intraoperative incident and complication rate was 9.6% and was higher in the STG group (13.5%) than in the BPTB group (8.7%). In the BPTB group, combined incidents and complications according to stage of the procedure consisted of graft harvesting, 4 cases (1.21%); tunnel placement, 9 cases (2.7%); and graft fixation, 15 cases (4.5%). In the STG group, combined incidents and complications included graft harvesting, 8 cases (8.3%); tunnel placement, 1 case (1%); graft fixation, 3 cases (3.1%); and others, 1 case (1%). In 4 patients (0.9%), we had to change the technique from BPTB to STG and vice versa. In 2 STG cases, conversion of the technique was required because of graft-related problems; in the third case, it was necessary because of fixation. One BPTB was converted to STG because the graft was completely transected as a result of improper screw fixation technique. Conclusions: None of the encountered incidents and complications had an adverse effect on final stability or on range of motion in operated knees. All incidents and complications were due to technical errors that occurred during graft harvesting, tunnel placement, or graft fixation. It is known that technical errors are preventable if careful surgical technique is followed. The surgeon must be well versed in various reconstruction techniques to be able to detect and resolve forthcoming incidents or complications. Backup implants are mandatory.

Successful ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon (PT) and hamstring tendon (HT) grafts combined with a well-structured rehabilitation program could bring athletes back to their previous level of sport activities. We prospectively followed-up 100 athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction with either PT (n=50) or HT grafts (n=50). Evaluation was done pre-operatively and post-operatively (3, 6, 12, and 24 months) using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, Noyes, and Tegner scales. Subjective assessment numeric evaluation (SANE), knee activity rating scale (Marx) and a psychological profile questionnaire (psychovitality) were also utilized. Objective evaluations included isokinetic tests and computerized knee motion analysis. Data gathered were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric U-test. Among the 100 patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction, 65% returned to the same level of sports, 24% changed sports and 11% ceased sport activities. No significant difference (P>0.05) in outcome between PT and HT grafts were observed. No significant differences (P>0.05) were noted between athletes who ""returned"" to their previous sport and those who ""did not return"" to sports at the same level when using the IKDC, Lysholm, Noyes, and Tegner knee evaluation scales. However, significant difference was observed with the knee scores obtained by those who returned and those who completely ceased participation in sport activities. Computerized laxity test revealed that 90% of these patients have less than 3 mm side-to-side difference with no significant difference between HT and PT groups. Patients who ""returned to sports"" obtained significantly better scores with the Marx scale (P=0.001) and the psychovitality questionnaire (P=0.001) than those who did not. Conventional knee scales including IKDC, Lysholm, Noyes, and Tegner remain as reliable means of evaluating outcome of ACL reconstruction. However, the data obtained from these are not sufficient to determine which among the patients who had knee reconstruction can successfully return to sport. The use of the Marx knee activity rating scale and the evaluation of the athletes' psychological profile are additional scales that can be useful in determining which among the patients treated have a better chance of returning to their pre-injury activity levels. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","ACL; Injury; Psychological; Scales; Sports","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; convalescence; female; follow up; human; injury; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; patella ligament; prospective study; psychological aspect; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; sport injury; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patellar Ligament; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Recovery of Function; Tendons","","","","","","","Adachi, Nobuo, Mechanoreceptors in the anterior cruciate ligament contribute to the joint position sense, Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica, 73, 3, pp. 330-334, (2002); Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison between patellar tendon and doubled semitendinosus/gracilis tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Methods: A clinical and radiological assessment was performed on 50 patients (21 male, 29 female, mean age 32 years, range 18 to 57 years) following ACL reconstruction using a patellar tendon autograft. The average follow-up examination was performed 18 (12 to 30) months after the operation. Results: 33 patients (66%) developed a tibial bone tunnel enlargement >1 mm. We found a positive correlation (+0.59) of the grade of activity and the muscle status (+0.56) to the tibial bone tunnel enlargement. Patients with a major tibial bone tunnel enlargement performed at a higher (p < 0.05) postoperative activity grade (5.2 versus 4.1 in the Tegner grading), rated higher in the Lysholm (88 versus 77 points) and IKDC scores (p < 0.05) and reported a better subjective functional outcome (p < 0.05). There was no significant correlation of the results of the knee stability tests and the age of the patients to the grade of tibial bone tunnel enlargement. Conclusions: In ACL reconstruction using a patellar tendon autograft we recommend early rehabilitation as the concomitant tibial bone tunnel enlargement does not significantly influence the clinical outcome or knee stability. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bone tunnel enlargement; Grade of activity; Outcome","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone disease; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; follow up; human; knee function; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; radiodiagnosis; tendon graft; tibia shaft; tibial bone tunnel enlargement; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Patellar Ligament; Postoperative Care; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Tibia; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Anatomic versus non-anatomic tibial fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, SUPPL. 1, pp. S43-S48, (1998); Barber, Frank Alan, The effect of outlet fixation on tunnel widening, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 19, 5, pp. 485-492, (2003); Bornert, K., Diagnostic by ultrasound in disbalances of the knee's neuromuscular system, Aktuelle Traumatologie, 24, 6, pp. 232-238, (1994); Buck, David C., Timeline of Tibial Tunnel Expansion after Single-Incision Hamstring Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 20, 1, pp. 34-36, (2004); Buzzi, Roberto, The relationship between the intercondylar roof and the tibial plateau with the knee in extension: Relevance for tibial tunnel placement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 15, 6, pp. 625-631, (1999); Buelow, Jens Ulrich, A prospective evaluation of tunnel enlargement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstrings: Extracortical versus anatomical fixation, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 10, 2, pp. 80-85, (2002); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); Fink, Christian, Tibial tunnel enlargement following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft, Arthroscopy, 17, 2, pp. 138-143, (2001); Füles, Péter J., Evaluation of tibial bone tunnel enlargement using MRI scan cross-sectional area measurement after autologous hamstring tendon ACL replacement, Knee, 10, 1, pp. 87-91, (2003); Grana, William A., An Analysis of Autograft Fixation After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in a Rabbit Model, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 344-351, (1994)","M.

The nature of this study is a prospective nonrandomized clinical outcome study. Thirty-five patients who underwent BPTB ACL reconstruction with a minimum of 2 years follow-up evaluation were included in the study. Thirty BPTB autografts and five BPTB allografts were fixed with two biodegradable 2.7 mm cross pins (Rigid Fix) on the femoral side. Clinical evaluation included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm and Tegner activity score, and Telos stress device measurements. The average Lysholm knee score was 94.7 (of 100). Twenty-four patients reported an excellent result. The other eight patients were in a good group. According to the IKDC scores, 23 (66%) patients reported normal function, 12 (34%) patients reported nearly normal function, and no (0%) patient reported abnormal or severely abnormal function. Telos stress device values were less than 3 mm of sagittal displacement in 28 patients and 5 mm in 7 patients. No patients complained that their knees gave way fully, even with moderate or strenuous activities. All of the patients have returned to their preinjury level of activity and athletic participation.

Hypotheses: Nonoperative and early operative treatments of grade III medial collateral ligament rupture lead to similar results when the anterior cruciate ligament is reconstructed in the early phase. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Forty-seven consecutive patients with combined anterior cruciate ligament and grade III medial collateral ligament injuries were randomized into 2 groups. The medial collateral ligament injury was treated operatively in group 1 (n = 23) and non-operatively in group 2 (n = 24). In both groups, the anterior cruciate ligament injury was treated with early reconstruction, using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and interference screw. Two years postoperatively, knee stability was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer and Telos valgus radiography and knee extension strength with a Biodex dynamometer and a 1-legged hop test. An International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation form and Lysholm score were completed. Results: All 47 patients were available for clinical evaluation for a mean of 27 months (range, 20-37 months) after surgery. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to subjective function of the knee, postoperative stability, range of motion, muscle power, return to activities, Lysholm score, and overall International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation. The subjective outcome and Lysholm score were good and anteroposterior knee stability excellent in both groups. Conclusion: Nonoperative and operative treatments of medial collateral ligament injuries lead to equally good results.

We compared the two methods, KT-1000 and Radiostereometric analysis (RSA), when used to measure anterior-posterior knee laxity (A-P laxity) in patients with ACL rupture, before and after the reconstruction of this ligament, in a prospective, comparative study. Twenty-two consecutive patients (14 men, 8 women) with a median age of 24 years (range 16-41) were studied. All the patients had a unilateral ACL rupture and an intact contralateral knee. The patients were operated on by one experienced surgeon using the bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autograft. Preoperatively and 2 years after the reconstruction, all the patients were evaluated using KT-1000 and RSA measurements of A-P laxity. The side-to-side differences between the injured and the intact knees, that is, total A-P laxity for both knees, are presented. Preoperatively, the median side-to-side differences using the two methods (KT-1000/RSA) were 4.0 (0-10)/7.4 mm (2.2-17.4) (P<0.0001). The total A-P laxity on the injured side was 11.0 (6.0-18.0)/10.9 mm (6.2-19.6) (n.s), while it was 8.0 (6.0-10.0)/3.1 mm (0.2-8.6) on the intact side (P<0.0001). A side-to-side difference of more than 3.0 mm was defined as the cut-off value for indicating ACL rupture. Using the KT-1000, 11 of 22 (50%) patients had a cut-off value above 3.0 mm, while the corresponding figure for RSA was 21/22 (95%) patients. At the 2-year follow-up, the median side-to-side differences using the two methods (KT-1000/RSA) were 0.5 (-1.5 to 4.0)/2.8 mm (-1.8 to 10.7) (P<0.0001). The total A-P laxity on the operated side was 9.5 (7.5-14.0)/6.5 mm (2.4-14.1) (P<0.0001). We conclude that the KT-1000 recorded significantly smaller side-to-side differences than did the RSA, both before and after the reconstruction of the ACL using a BTB autograft. Before it was mainly an effect of larger A-P laxity recordings with KT-1000 on the intact side, and after the reconstruction, the KT-1000 still recorded larger A-P laxity on the intact side and also larger A-P laxity on the reconstructed side than RSA. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Anterior cruciate ligament; KT-1000; Radiostereometric analysis; Reconstruction; RSA; Rupture","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; biomechanics; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comparative study; conference paper; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; male; orthopedic equipment; pathophysiology; prospective study; rupture; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Male; Orthopedic Equipment; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Rupture","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Anderson, Allen F., Preoperative instrumented testing of anterior and posterior knee laxity, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 3, pp. 387-392, (1989); Anderson, Allen F., Instrumented evaluation of knee laxity: A comparison of five arthrometers, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 135-140, (1992); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthrometric evaluation of knees that have a torn anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 9, pp. 1299-1306, (1990); Ballantyne, Bryon T., Influence of examiner experience and gender on interrater reliability of KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, Physical Therapy, 75, 10, pp. 898-906, (1995); Bragdon, Charles R., Experimental assessment of precision and accuracy of radiostereometric analysis for the determination of polyethylene wear in a total hip replacement model, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 20, 4, pp. 688-695, (2002); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, Kinematics after tear in the anterior cruciate ligament: Dynamic bilateral radiostereometric studies in 11 patients, Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica, 72, 4, pp. 372-378, (2001); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, Kinematics and laxity of the knee joint after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Clinical observations suggest that impingement of the graft against the posterior cruciate ligament might cause high graft tensions. Also, meniscal injury has been well documented in association with damage in the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods: In this paper, we present the results obtained in a three-dimensional finite element model of the human knee, corresponding to different aspects of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts. This model was used to investigate the effect of the angle in the coronal plane of femoral and tibial tunnels. Firstly, graft tension was computed in a knee moved from 0° to 60° of flexion and the results were compared with experimental ones obtained by other authors. Secondly, the resulting kinematics under an anterior load of 134 N was compared to that of the intact knee. Findings: The obtained results showed that the closest anterior tibial translation to that of the intact knee was obtained with femoral and tibial tunnels with angles of 60°. In this same case, a lower graft tension was also obtained. The results demonstrated noticeable increases in the meniscal stresses after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Interpretation: Our results showed that impingement only depends on the femoral tunnel angle. On the contrary, laxity principally depends on the tibial tunnel angle. The angle of the femoral tunnel affects the graft tension while the tibial tunnel affects laxity, meniscal stresses and strains. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied 2 randomized homogeneous groups of 20+20 athletes (20 with hamstrings, 20 with patellar tendon) comparing the results evaluted according to the IKCD score. The patellar tendon (using half tunnel arthroscopic technique) was fixed with 2 interference screws, while we used a femoral Transfix, and an interference screw and a metallic staple for the tibia to fix hamstrings. Results. On the basis of our experience, we did not find any difference between the 2 methods, both as to objective evaluation and with KT 1000, as well as according to the patient's point of view. Conclusion. Hamstrings show reliable results as much as patellar tendon, but with a decreased morbidity.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Hamstrings vs patellar tendon; IKCD vote","article; athlete; fracture fixation; hamstring; human; knee arthroplasty; knee cruciate ligament; patella tendon","","","","","","","Noyes, Frank R., Biomechanical analysis of human ligament grafts used in knee-ligament repairs and reconstructions, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 66, 3, pp. 344-352, (1984); Morgan, Craig D., Isometry testing for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction revisited, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 6, pp. 647-659, (1995); Hamner, Dyson L., Hamstring tendon grafts for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: Biomechanical evaluation of the use of multiple strands and tensioning techniques, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 81, 4, pp. 549-557, (1999); Clark, Ron, Cross-pin femoral fixation: A new technique for hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction of the knee, Arthroscopy, 14, 3, pp. 258-267, (1998); Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society, (1997); Stähelin, Andreas C., Clinical degradation and biocompatibility of different bioabsorbable interference screws: A report of six cases, Arthroscopy, 13, 2, pp. 238-244, (1997); Katabi, Moussalam, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Patellar tendon autograft versus four-strand hamstring tendon autografts.

Whether reconstruction is indicated and which technique should be employed is still controversial. The debate focuses on the possible risk of growth plate damages due to intraarticular operative reconstruction techniques. For more details on benefit and risks of operative stabilization, our clinic's large number of surgical results was to be evaluated retrospectively. In a total of 437 knee joint arthroscopies performed between 1982 and 1992 in children and adolescents with open physes, aged 3-16 years, 63 surgical repair/reconstructions according to an algorithm were carried out. The average age at surgery was 13.8 years. Follow-up an average 6.5 years after the operation consisted of clinical and radiological examination, Lysholm, Tegner, and IKDC scores. This report focuses on intraarticular ligament reconstruction methods. Forty-four patients could be followed up, comprising of five reinsertions, ten internal fixations, 15 cases semitendinosus tendon (ST) augmentations, and 14 primary reconstructions with the middle one-third of the patellar tendon (PT). In every ST and PT case, transtibial and transfemoral tunnels were drilled. The clinical stability examination was supplemented by KT-1000 arthrometer measurements and radiography in two planes. Averaged for all surgical techniques, good and very good results were obtained in over 75% of cases. There were no major growth defects and rarely signs of osteoarthrosis. According to literature, conservative treatment of ACL tears and even primary ACL repair is not infrequently followed by re-ruptures. Therefore, reconstruction is the preferred procedure for patients aged 12 years or more. As most authors hesitate to possibly block the physes by obtaining and anchoring patellar tendon grafts, the ST should be preferred. This study demonstrates in a large number of ACL stabilizations, despite transepiphyseal drilling and grafting, very good stabilization is achieved, but no growth defects have to be expected. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","ACL tears; Arthroscopy; Fracture of the intercondylar eminence; Haemarthrosis; Ligament injuries in children and adolescents","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; child; follow up; growth disorder; human; injury; knee; knee injury; methodology; preschool child; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Child; Child, Preschool; Follow-Up Studies; Growth Disorders; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Retrospective Studies; Sprains and Strains; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Natural History of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries in Children and Adolescents an Intermediate Term Follow Up Study, (1994); Aichroth, P.

A few studies have examined gender differences in the outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon graft and hamstring tendon with EndoButton fixation, but no well-controlled studies have specifically compared men and women after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft and interference screw fixation. Hypothesis: There is no difference in outcome between men and women after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendon autograft and interference screw fixation. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: There were 100 men and 100 women who underwent isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by a single surgeon. Patients were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 2, and 7 years after surgery. Variables were compared between female and male patients. Results: Laxity on physical evaluation was greater in women than in men on Lachman (P = .04), pivot-shift (P = .05), and mean manual maximum testing (P = .05) at 7 years. However, the magnitude of this difference was small. No patient had a greater than grade 1 Lachman or pivot-shift test result, and the mean difference between men and women was 0.6 mm on instrumented testing. Anterior cruciate ligament graft rupture occurred in 11 men and 10 women. There was no difference between male and female patients for self-reported knee function or symptoms of instability or radiologic examination. Conclusion: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon autograft affords excellent self-reported and objective results in both men and women after 7 years. Although significantly greater laxity on physical examination was present in female patients than in male patients, the magnitude of this difference was small and had no effect on activity level, graft failure, or subjective or functional assessment. © 2006 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Gender; Hamstring; Laxity; Reconstruction","anterior cruciate ligament injury; article; controlled study; female; fracture fixation; human; joint laxity; knee function; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; patient assessment; physical examination; preoperative period; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; self report; sex difference; tendon graft; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Screws; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Sex Factors; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Anderson, Allen F., Correlation of anthropometric measurements, strength, anterior cruciate ligament size, and intercondylar notch characteristics to sex differences in anterior cruciate ligament tear rates, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 1, pp. 58-66, (2001); Knee Surgery, (1994); Arendt, Elizabeth Anne, Knee Injury Patterns Among Men and Women in Collegiate Basketball and Soccer: NCAA Data and Review of Literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 694-701, (1995); Aune, Arne Kristian, Four-strand hamstring tendon autograft compared with patellar tendon-bone autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomized study with two-year follow-up, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 722-728, (2001); Barber-Westin, Sue D., A rigorous comparison between the sexes of results and complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 4, pp. 514-526, (1997); Barrett, Gene R., Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in females: A comparison of hamstring versus patellar tendon autograft, Arthroscopy, 18, 1, pp. 46-54, (2002); Brand, Jeff C., Interference screw fixation strength of a quadrupled hamstring tendon graft is directly related to bone mineral density and insertion torque, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 5, pp. 705-710, (2000); Corry, Ian S., Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Main Outcome Measurements: Using a 6-camera motion analysis system, kinematics were collected as subjects (1) descended from a stair and, after foot contact, pivoted on the landing leg at 90°; and (2) jumped from a platform, landed with both feet on the ground and, after foot contact, pivoted on the right or left leg at 90° in a similar fashion. The dependent variable examined was the maximum range of motion of tibial rotation during the pivoting period. Results: For both activities, no significant differences were found between the control healthy knee and the intact knee of the patient group before and 2 years after the ACL reconstruction. Significant differences were found between the control healthy knee and the affected knee of the patients group for both activities, both before and 2 years after the ACL reconstruction. Conclusion: The increased tibial rotation found in the ACL-deficient knees was not restored with reconstruction using a BPTB graft, even 2 years postoperatively. The authors propose that this excessive tibial rotation over time may lead to further deterioration of the knee resulting from abnormal loading at areas of the cartilage that are not commonly loaded in a healthy knee.

Type of Study: A 2-year prospective cohort study with assessment of patient evaluation of knee performance, clinical scoring of surgical results, and measurement of BMD in the tibia and calcaneus. Methods: Eighteen patients with a unilateral ACL rupture underwent an autogenous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft ACL reconstruction. The patients were examined before surgery and after 4, 12, and 24 months. BMD was assessed bilaterally in the proximal tibia and calcaneus using dual-photon absorptiometry and converted to a Z-score by use of BMD values from a group of healthy controls. Clinical evaluation included determination of Lysholm score, quantitative Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and the patients' self-reported highest level of activity and knee performance in sports and daily activities. Results: There were significant declines in Z-score of the proximal tibia of the operated leg during the first year after surgery, whereas there was no change in the calcaneus and contralateral leg. In the lateral tibia, the Z-score was significantly lower at 24 months follow-up, compared with both controls and the noninjured side, whereas BMD of the medial tibia had returned to near normal levels. There were significant improvements in Lysholm score, highest level of activity, and knee performance in daily activities and sports. The patients' evaluation of improvement in knee performance in sports activities at 24 months follow-up was associated with an increase in Z-score of the injured leg. Conclusions: We found a partially reversible decline in BMD of the proximal tibia after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Improvement in knee performance in sports activities was associated with an increase in BMD of the injured leg. BMD of the calcaneus remained unaffected in both legs.

The groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, time from injury to surgery and concomitant injuries. There were no differences either pre-operatively or 5 years post-operatively (80% of patients reviewed) between the groups in terms of the knee score (Lysholm), activity level (Tegner), degree of laxity or isokinetic peak muscle torque.

Hypothesis: The femoral press-fit fixation technique is a safe, alternative technique for the fixation of the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2002, 285 patients, with a mean age of 29.1 years, underwent operation and observation in our department. All patients had arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft with femoral press-fit and tibial interference screw fixation. The mean follow-up period was 35.8 months (range, 24-77 months). During each patient's evaluation, a physical examination, a subjective evaluation, the International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores, KT-1000 arthrometer testing, and radiological evaluation were performed. The paired Student f test or χ2 test was used for statistical analysis. Results: According to the International Knee Documentation Committee score, 241 patients (85%) had good (46 normal and 195 nearly normal) results, whereas 39 patients had abnormal and 5 patients had severely abnormal overall results. The preoperative mean Lysholm score was 63.5 ± 12.7 points. At the final examination, the mean value was 93.5 ± 7.8 points (P < .01). One hundred ninety-seven athletes could return to their previous sports activity level, whereas 13 patients gave up their sports career. The KT-1000 arthrometer results showed a side-to-side difference of 1.91 ± 2.1 mm at the maximum manual strength tests. Conclusion: The femoral press-fit fixation is an alternative fixation method for the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and provides good stability for the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The use of press-fit fixation technique avoids most interference screw or other hardware-induced complications at the femoral side. © 2006 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","ACL reconstruction; Follow-up study; Patellar tendon; Press-fit fixation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament injury; arthrometry; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone graft; bone screw; evaluation; female; femur; follow up; fracture fixation; human; knee instability; knee radiography; Lysholm score; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; physical examination; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; safety; scoring system; sport; surgical technique; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroplasty; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Internal Fixators; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","","","KT-1000","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Al-Husseiny, Moustafa, Press-fit fixation in reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament, using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 2, pp. 104-109, (2004); Am J Knee Surg, (1989); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

Correct position of the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft significantly affects the postoperative knee stability. The aim of this study was to establish if and how clinically measured knee stability is associated with radiographic position of bone-patellar tendon-bone graft in the femoral and tibial bones. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prospective study included 39 patients, 30 men and 9 women. We analyzed and compared results of clinical and radiographic examinations prior to and 2 years following surgery. RESULTS: The mean arthrometric difference between the anterior tibial movement prior to surgery was 11.2 mm and 2.4 mm (p < 0.05) after surgery. The preoperative Tegner and Lysholm score was 1.49, and postoperative 8.23 (p < 0.05). The preoperative Lysholm-Gillquist scale was 51.56 and postoperative 97.74 (p < 0.05). The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were as follows: grade A in 32 patients (84.6%), grade B in 5 patients (12.8%), and grade C in 1 patient (2.6%). By comparison of IKDC scores and radiographic parameters (M1-M10) of anterior-posterior and profile views, a statistical significance was found only between IKDC and M9 index (sagittal femoral index OR'/RR' x 100). DISCUSSION: By using bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts, it is not possible to entirely achieve anatomical positions. Correct graft position within the bone tunnels is of great significance concerning knee stability after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. CONCLUSION: Correlation between radiological and clinical findings after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in our 39 patients shows that only the position of the graft affects the clinical outcome. Posterior graft location provides better clinical outcome and knee stability. On the other hand, anterior location is associated with worse postoperative IKDC scores, unstable knee and worse clinical outcome.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; female; human; injury; male; middle aged; radiography; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged","","","","","","","","S.

Material and methods: From January 1995 to March 1998, 63 knees underwent surgery for ACL reconstruction. Inclusion criteria was significant medial differential laxity measured between 7 and 12 mm on passive dynamic x-rays as 20° flexion. Group 1 (patellar tendon intra-articular reconstruction) included 34 patients (27.1±7.5 years) and group 2 (intra-articular reconstruction plus extra-articular quadircipital tendon plasty) included 29 patients (28.5±12 years). The IKDC score was determined for 72% of the knees in group 1 and 68% in group 2 at seven years follow-up on average (102 and 93 months respectively). Anterior laxity was measured radiographically and with KT-1000. The position of the tunnels was controlled using the Aglietti method. Results: The subjective functional score was 83.6±3.5 in group 1 and 83.5±3.5 in group 2. The overall IKDC knee score classes for group 1 were 0% A, 52.4% B, 28.6% C, and 19% D and for group 2 were 5.5% group A, 50% group B, 33.3% group C, and 11.1% group D. In group 1, the pivot test was negative in 61.9% and noted stage 1 in 28.6% and stage 2 in 9.5%. In group 2, the pivot test was negative in 78.9% and noted stage 1 in 15.8% and stage 2 in 5.3%. The KT-1000 showed no difference in gain in laxity: 31% for group 1 and 27% for group 2. Similarly, radiographically there was no difference with a 43.9% gain in differential laxity for the medial compartment and 45.3% for the lateral compartment in group 1. In group 2 the corresponding values were 51.9% and 41.8%. The position of the tunnels was the same in the two groups. Discussion: In a preliminary study with two years follow-up, the results in these two series were not significantly different. It was concluded that there was not clear advantage to adding the extra-articular lateral plasty. At the present 7-year follow-up, pivoting appears to be better controlled in the lateral plasty group (p=0.23), but with no significant difference for laxity for both knee compartments. The inclusion criteria would be different today and would be based on the laxity of the lateral compartment. © 2006. Elsevier Masson SAS.

Management practices have varied. One-stage reconstruction of both ligaments using arthroscopically implanted allografts was proposed starting in 1996 for such chronic laxity but only 44 cases have been reported in six papers mixed in with recent cases raising very different problems. Treatments using allografts or autogenous grafts or both implanted arthroscopically have often been combined with open surgery. We report a retrospective analysis of 25 knees treated with the same technique from 1983 to 2004: reconstruction with a single transplant taken from the extensor system. Material and methods: A 30-cm lenght patella tendon-patella-quadriceps tendon graft was harvested. The patellar block was fixed in a hole drilled under the tibial spine, the patellar tendon replacing the posterior cruciate ligament and the quadriceps tendon passing through the lateral condyle and replacing the anterior cruciate ligament before implantation on Gerdy's tubercle, this also creating an extra-articular plasty with the same implant. Medial, lateral and posterior plasties were performed, depending on the radiographic assessment of laxity. Twenty-five knees with major laxity and instability were operated on, including 14 in two-stage operations. The differential anterior drawer was 10±3 mm medially and 9±5 mm laterally. The posterior drawer at 70° was 15±4 mm medially and 10±6 degrees laterally. The total anteroposterior laxity of the medial compartment was 29 mm, it was 30 mm for the lateral compartment. Lateral laxity was considered major (≥10°) in 17 knees and medial laxity in 7. Lateral and medial laxities were associated in eleven knees. Hyper-extension was very severe in five knees. Results: Functional outcome at mean 6.5 years follow-up (range 1-21) was satisfactory (except in three knees) allowing renewed occupational activity. Resumption of sports activity was less marked and none of the knees was in IKDC class A, corroborating results in the literature. Anatomic outcome was assessed on the radiological drawer decrease which was modest, mean gain in the anterior drawer measuring 4 and 5 mm in the medial and lateral compartments and mean gain in the posterior drawer measuring 5 mm medially and 3 mm laterally. Peripheral laxity was corrected for best. Discussion: Classically, one or other of the cruciate ligaments is repaired, sometimes both, but in a two-stage procedure associating two different methods and autogenous tendon grafts. One-stage reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments with a single autogenous graft and a wide approach has not led to any complications. One-stage reconstruction using this technique has several advantages: one anterior incision, single transplant which also enables lateral plasty, short immobilization time with rapid rehabilitation. © 2006.

Twenty-eight of the subjects were in the 3rd to 6th month postsurgery (MPS) (Gr. ST I, Gr. BPTB I), 20 patients were in the 6th to 12th MPS (Gr. ST II, Gr. BPTB II) and 21 patients in the 12th to 24th MPS (Gr. ST III, Gr. BPTB III). The subjects had to perform concentric contractions of the extensor and flexor muscles of the knee, hip and ankle at 60 °/s. In addition, the knee muscles were isometrically tested at knee angles of 0° and 45°. The analysis of the muscular strength capabilities revealed significant differences (P<0.05) in maximal isokinetic torque (M<inf>max,con</inf>) for the knee extensor muscles between both the two reconstruction techniques in groups ST II/ BPTB II and ST III/ BPTB III favouring the ST method. The clinical tests (OAK evaluation form) cannot provide a criterion clearly favouring one of the studied techniques. When comparing the muscular strength capabilities, the isokinetic torgue torque of the knee extensors for the intervals 6 to 12 and 12 to 24 MPS, the BPTB patients appear to be weaker than the ST patients. This can be attributed to the traumatic lesion of the patella. Whereas the BPTB patients also show strength deficits when comparing the affected with the unaffected side, the ST patients demonstrate better regeneration of their muscular strength capabilities.","ACL reconstruction; Lower extremity; Muscle strength","","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Anderson, Allen F., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Methods: This is the third report on a group of patients who were randomized to the three different procedures between 1986 and 1988. There were fifty patients in each group. The patients were evaluated prospectively at one, two, five, and sixteen years with use of the Tegner activity score and the Lysholm functional score. Stability of the knee was assessed with clinical examination and with use of the KT-1000 arthrometer. Results: One hundred and twenty-nine (88%) of the 147 patients who were available for follow-up completed the study. Eleven patients (24%) who had a primary repair, four patients (10%) who had repair with a ligament augmentation device, and one patient (2%) who had augmentation with autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft underwent anterior cruciate ligament revisions between the primary operation and the sixteen-year follow-up examination. The rate of revision was ten times higher in the group that had primary repair than in the group that had repair with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (p = 0.003). In the remaining patients, those who had repair with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had significantly more stable knees than those who had repair with a ligament augmentation device, as measured by the Lachman test (p = 0.026). Nine (11%) of the eighty-five patients for whom data were available had osteoarthritis in the primarily reconstructed knee, and three patients (3.5%) had osteoarthritis in the contralateral knee at sixteen years (p = 0.001); no difference was noted among the three groups. The mean Lysholm score at sixteen years was 88 points for the knees that had primary repair, 85 points for those that had repair with the ligament augmentation device, and 90 points for those managed with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (p = 0.286). Conclusions: At long-term (sixteen-year) follow-up, the rate of revision anterior cruciate ligament surgery is much higher following primary repair than after primary repair augmented by a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. It can be expected that approximately 10% of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction acutely will have osteoarthritis develop in the reconstructed knee. We no longer perform any of these surgical techniques as open procedures. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level I.

Objectives: To present a progressively increasing negative-work exercise program via eccentric ergometry early after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) and to suggest the potential of negative work to amplify the return of quadriceps size and strength. Case Description: The patient was a 26-year-old highly active recreational athlete who sustained an ACL tear while skiing in January 2004 and then again while skiing in February 2005. This individual underwent an arthroscopically assisted ACL-R with a double-loop semitendinosus-gracilis autograft initially, then a patellar tendon autograft following his ACL graft rupture. Beginning within 3 weeks after surgery, a progressive negative-work exercise program was initiated using an eccentric ergometer. The patient completed 31 training sessions of 5 to 30 minutes in duration over a 12-week period following the ACL-R and 33 training sessions of the same frequency and duration following the ACL revision. Outcomes: Following ACL-R, quadriceps volume increased 28% (involved lower extremity) and 14% (uninvolved lower extremity) during the 12-week training program. Following revision, quadriceps volume returned to similar levels at the same postoperative period as those achieved after the initial surgery (2% less on the involved side and 2% greater on the uninvolved side). Quadriceps strength, 15 weeks after ACL-R, exceeded preoperative measures by an average of 20% (involved) and 14% (uninvolved). Quadriceps strength after ACL revision exceeded all previous measures. Discussion: This case report suggests that if gradually and progressively applied, negative work via eccentric ergometry can be both safe and efficacious early after ACL-R. Eccentric exercise may mitigate the prevalent muscle size and strength deficits commonly observed after ACL-R. The results of this case suggest a need for continued research with early negative work interventions following ACL-R.","ACL; Knee; Muscle physiology; Skiing","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; case report; eccentric ergometry; ergometry; exercise; gracilis muscle; human; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; male; muscle graft; muscle mass; muscle strength; quadriceps femoris muscle; semitendinous muscle","","","","","","","Arangio, George A., Thigh muscle size and strength after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and rehabilitation, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 26, 5, pp. 238-243, (1997); Techniques in Knee Surgery, (2001); Barber, Sue D., Quantitative assessment of functional limitations in normal and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 255, pp. 204-214, (1990); Bigland-Ritchie, Brenda R., Integrated electromyogram and oxygen uptake during positive and negative work., The Journal of Physiology, 260, 2, pp. 267-277, (1976); Ejerhed, Lars Erik, Patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?

The central quadriceps tendon autograft is an alternative to bone-patellar tendon-bone and free hamstring autografts. The purpose of this study was to measure the postharvest reduction in quadriceps extensor mechanism strength when a central quadriceps free tendon graft is removed. The strength deficit was compared with that associated with harvesting a central free patellar tendon graft, excluding the effects of harvesting bone blocks. Type of Study: Experimental laboratory study. Methods: Fourteen knee extensor mechanisms were divided into quadriceps and patellar tendon constructs. Constructs were tested to failure in tension in either the intact state or after removing 10-mm wide central free tendon grafts. Failure strengths of the quadriceps and patellar tendon constructs were compared statistically using paired and unpaired t tests. Results: The average strength (±SD) measured for the native quadriceps tendon was 3,660 ± 830 N, decreasing to 2,430 ± 680 N after removing a partial-thickness 10-mm wide central free graft. The average strength measured for the native patellar tendon was 1,920 ± 330 N, decreasing to 1,460 ± 740 N after removing a 10-mm wide central free graft. Conclusions: The tensile strength of the quadriceps tendon is reduced by approximately one third after harvesting a partial-thickness 10-mm wide central free tendon graft. This postharvest strength of the quadriceps tendon is higher than that of the intact patellar tendon. Clinical Relevance: Surgeons can be assured that harvest of a central quadriceps free tendon graft leaves a stronger extensor mechanism than harvest of a patellar tendon graft. © 2006 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Central quadriceps free tendon graft; Patellar tendon; Quadriceps mechanism strength; Quadriceps tendon","adult; article; controlled study; extensor muscle; free tissue graft; human; human tissue; knee function; muscle strength; muscle tone; patella tendon; postoperative period; quadriceps femoris muscle; Student t test; surgical technique; tendon; tendon graft; tensile strength; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Patella; Tendon Transfer; Tendons; Tensile Strength; Tissue and Organ Harvesting; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","Supported by the Greater Hartford Orthopaedic Education and Research Foundation and the University of Connecticut Health Center.","Marshall, John L., The anterior cruciate ligament: A technique of repair and reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, No. 143, pp. 97-106, (1979); Kornblatt, Ira, Long-term followup of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the quadriceps tendon substitution for chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 16, 5, pp. 444-448, (1988); Howe, James G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadriceps patellar tendon graft.

Between July 1998 and November 2001 Medical Academy of Gdańsk's Clinic of Orthopedics and Traumatology performed 42 arthroscopic reconstructions of the anterior cruciate ligament using the patella's central ligament graft. The following study was based on the analysis of patient histories, questionnaires and physical examinations. 19 patients between the age of 21 and 52, with median age of 30, were examined. The average observation period (counting from reconstruction to the examination date) was 35 months. For the patients the ""łuska Adama"" stabilizer was used for at least 6 weeks. The modified IKDC scale has been used in the evaluation of the results. Good results were achieved in 42% of the cases, satisfactory in 42% and non-satisfactory in 16% of the cases. Based on the subjective opinions of patients the evaluation of the reconstruction was as follows: good in 10 cases, satisfactory in 5 and negative in 4 cases. On the other hand, the stability of the knee joint according to the physical examination was good in 53% of the cases, satisfactory in 26% and negative in 21%. The effects of the reconstruction correlate to the quality and intensity of rehabilitation before and after the surgery, as well as depend on the condition of the knee and the muscular apparatus from before the injury.","","adult; anamnesis; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone graft; clinical article; controlled study; hospital; human; knee arthroscopy; knee injury; long term care; patella tendon; physical examination; questionnaire; rehabilitation care; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Campbell S Operative Orthopedics 9 Ed, (1998); Acta Clin, (2001); Daniel, Dale M., Indications for ACL surgery, Arthroscopy, 10, 4, pp. 434-441, (1994); Uszkodzenia Stawu Kolanowego, (2002); Acta Clinica, (2002); Badania Stawu Rzepkowo Udowego I Wizadta Rzepki Po Pobraniu Przeszczepu Z Wizadla Rzepki Uzytego do Rekonstrukcji Wizadla Krzyzowego Przedniego, (1996); Wybrane Problemy Rozpoznawania I Leczenia Zastarzalych Uszkodzen Wizadla Krzyzowego Przedniego, (1988); Acta Clin, (2002); Rockwood and Green S Fractures in Adults, (2001); Ligament and Extensor Mechanism Injuries of the Knee, (1991)","M.

Methods: From November 1999 to November 2003, the injured ACL and PCL of 11 patients were fixated with compressed screws and reconstructed under arthroscopy with the bone-patellar tendon-bone treated with deep hypothermia and γ radiation. At the same time, 2 patients were treated with medial collateral ligament (MCL) reconstruction, 3 with lateral collateral ligament (LCL) reconstruction, 1 with meniscus suture and 4 with whole or partial resection. Results: All patients were followed up for 12-26 months (average 16.5 months). The Lysholm score method was employed to evaluate the knee function. The average preoperative score was 45.3 and the postoperative score was 86.4. Anterior drawer test (ADT) was positive in 11 knees preoperatively and feeble positive in one knee postoperatively. Lachman test was positive in 11 knees preoperatively and in one postoperatively, and feebly positive in two postoperatively. Posterior drawer test was positive in 11 knees preoperatively and feebly positive in 2 postoperatively. There were 2 knees with tolerable pain and 2 with knee flexion of 5°-20°. Conclusions: As for simultaneous reconstruction of ACL and PCL under arthroscopy, allogeneic bone-patellar tendon-bone can not only avoid injury and complication caused by autografting, but also help rehabilitation of the knee function.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Posterior cruciate ligament; Tendons; Transplantation","adult; allotransplantation; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone screw; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; gamma irradiation; human; induced hypothermia; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee ligament injury; knee meniscus rupture; knee pain; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; postoperative period; preoperative period; scoring system","","","","","","","Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); Fanelli, Gregory C., Arthroscopically assisted combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 12, 1, pp. 5-14, (1996); Mariani, Pierpaolo, One-stage arthroscopically assisted anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 17, 7, pp. 700-707, (2001); Miller, Mark D., Arthroscopic allograft anteriorcruciate ligament reconstruction, Operative Techniques in Sports Medicine, 3, 3, pp. 148-156, (1995); Chin J Orthop, (2000); Marder, Richard A., Effects of partial patellectomy and reattachment of the patellar tendon on patellofemoral contact areas and pressures, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 75, 1, pp. 35-45, (1993); Noyes, Frank R., Bone-patellar ligament-bone and fascia lata allografts for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 8, pp. 1125-1136, (1990); Chin J Repair Reconstr Surg, (1998); Friedlaender, Gary E., Studies on the antigenicity of bone.

The purpose of this study was to explore these findings in vivo and investigate rotational knee stability during landing and subsequent pivoting. Such an activity places higher demands on the knee, almost similar to those found during high-level sports. Type of Study: Case control series study. Methods: We assessed 11 patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction with the same arthroscopic technique using a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, 11 ACL-deficient subjects who had sustained the injury more than 1 year prior to testing, and 11 matched controls. Kinematic data were collected (50 Hz) with a 6-camera optoelectronic system while the subjects performed the following task: they jumped off a 40-cm platform and landed on the ground. After foot contact, the subjects were instructed to pivot at 90°and walk away from the platform. The evaluation period was identified from initial foot contact with the ground with both legs, included the pivoting of the ipsilateral leg, and was completed on touchdown of the contralateral leg. Results: Significant differences were found between the reconstructed leg of the ACL group and the healthy control, and between the deficient leg of the ACL-deficient group and the healthy control. We also found no significant differences between the deficient leg of the ACL-deficient group and the reconstructed leg of the ACL reconstructed group. Conclusions: It was concluded that, under high-stress activities, ACL reconstruction may not restore tibial rotation to the previous physiological level, even though anterior tibial translation is restored. Future research on ACL reconstruction should focus on the development of new surgical procedures and/or grafts to address this problem.

The contralateral normal knee was used as a control. All knees were clinically stable with high clinical scores (mean Lysholm score, 93; mean Tegner activity score, 6). Fifteen patients had undergone a partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction at or before reconstruction of their ACL. In the group with an intact meniscus, clinical symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) were found in only one patient (7%), who was also the only patient with marked isotope uptake on the SPECT scan compatible with OA. In the group which underwent a partial meniscectomy, clinical symptoms of OA were found in two patients (13%), who were among five (31%) with isotope uptake compatible with OA. Only one patient (7%) in this group had evidence of advanced OA on plain radiographs. The risk of developing OA after ACL reconstruction in this series is very low and lower than published figures for untreated ACL-deficient knees.

Interference screw fixation in ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BPTB) is a potential source of intraoperative complications such as graft laceration. Further problems are artifacts on MRI and screw removal in revision surgery. These problems can be avoided by using distant fixation with the EndoButton. We designed this study to evaluate the clinical as well as the subjective outcome of ACL reconstruction with BPTB graft and femoral fixation with the EndoButton. Methods. A total of 51 patients (7 female, 44 male) were examined 2-5 years after ACL reconstruction with BPTB graft and femoral fixation with the EndoButton. We used the IKDC form, Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, and digital radiographs (AP, lateral, axial) for the evaluation. Results. Of all the patients included in the study, 87% showed a ""normal"" or ""nearly normal"" knee function according to the IKDC score, Lysholm score 94.2±7.9, Tegner score 6.4±1.2, and subjective IKDC 89.9±11.9. Radiological signs of arthritic changes could be seen in ten cases. Conclusion. The clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction with EndoButton fixation is comparable to other studies on ACL reconstruction with interference screw fixation. However, since the EndoButton avoids potential problems of the interference screw fixation, we recommend this fixation technique for ACL reconstruction with BPTB graft. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2005.","ACL reconstruction; Clinical follow-up; EndoButton; IKDC","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; controlled study; digital radiography; evaluation; female; follow up; human; knee function; knee surgery; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; tendon graft; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Equipment Failure Analysis; External Fixators; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Germany; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Al-Husseiny, Moustafa, Press-fit fixation in reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament, using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 2, pp. 104-109, (2004); Am J Knee Surg, (1989); Barber, Frank Alan, Preliminary results of an absorbable interference screw, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 5, pp. 537-548, (1995); Barrett, Gene R., Endobutton button endoscopie fixation technique in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 3, pp. 340-343, (1995); Boszotta, Harald, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft in press-fit technique: Surgical technique and follow-up, Arthroscopy, 13, 3, pp. 332-339, (1997); Boszotta, Harald, Arthroscopic reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament using BTB patellar ligament in the press-fit technique., Surgical technology international, 11, pp. 249-253, (2003); Campbell, John D., The evolution and current treatment trends with anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, and medial collateral ligament injuries., The American journal of knee surgery, 11, 2, pp. 128-135, (1998); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior knee laxity in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament disruption, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 6, pp. 401-407, (1985)","C.

Hypothesis: There will be no difference in the effectiveness of a home-based rehabilitation program and a standard physical therapy-supervised rehabilitation program in patients 3 months after nonacute anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: There were 145 patients (16-59 years) who attended a presurgery education class. Home-based patients attended 4 physical therapy sessions, and physical therapy-supervised patients attended 17 physical therapy sessions over the first 12 weeks after surgery. All patients followed the same standardized rehabilitation program. Study outcome measures included active-assisted knee flexion and passive knee extension range of motion, knee range of motion during walking, KT computerized arthrometer results, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstrings strength. Patient outcomes were dichotomized as either clinically acceptable or unacceptable. Rehabilitation programs were compared by the proportion of acceptable patients in each group. Results: The home-based group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with acceptable flexion and extension range of motion compared to the standard physical therapy group (flexion, 67% vs 47%; extension, 97% vs 83%). There were no significant differences between the groups in range of motion during walking, ligament laxity, and strength. Conclusion: A structured, minimally supervised rehabilitation program was more effective in achieving acceptable knee range of motion in the first 3 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than a standard physical therapy-based program. Clinical Relevance: Recreational athletes undergoing nonacute anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction can successfully reach acceptable rehabilitation goals in the first 3 months after surgery with a limited number of purposeful physical therapy education sessions, allowing recreational athletes more flexibility when integrating the necessary postoperative rehabilitation into their daily activities. © 2005 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Cost effectiveness; Rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; hamstring; health care policy; home care; human; intermethod comparison; isokinetic exercise; joint function; joint mobility; knee function; major clinical study; male; outcomes research; patient education; physiotherapy; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; randomized controlled trial; recreation; single blind procedure; standardization; statistical significance; walking; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Exercise Therapy; Female; Gait; Home Care Services, Hospital-Based; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Rupture; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Ageberg, Eva, Influence of supervised and nonsupervised training on postural control after an acute anterior cruciate ligament rupture: A three-year longitudinal prospective study, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 31, 11, pp. 632-644, (2001); Beard, David John, Home or supervised rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomized controlled trial, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 27, 2, pp. 134-143, (1998); Beard, David John, Gait and electromyographic analysis of anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects, Gait and Posture, 4, 2, pp. 83-88, (1996); Boone, D.

Type of Study: Case series. Methods: Included in this retrospective study were 948 patients (323 female, 625 male) with a symptomatic unilateral ACL rupture, who underwent arthroscopic reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft and interference screw fixation at 3 Swedish hospitals. The median age of the patients at the time of the index operation was 26 years (range, 14 to 53 years). The patients underwent surgery at a median of 12 months (range, 0.5 to 360 months) after their injury. Independent physiotherapists performed the follow-up examinations at a median of 32 months (range, 21 to 117 months) postoperatively. Results: Of the 948 patients, 550 (58%) underwent meniscal surgery before, during, or after the ACL reconstruction. The median Tegner activity level was 8 (range, 2-10) before injury, 3 (range, 0-9) preoperatively, and 6 (range, 1-10) at follow-up (P < .0001 preoperative v follow-up). At follow-up, the median Lysholm score was 90 points (range, 14-100), the median KT-1000 anterior side-to-side laxity difference was 1.5 mm (range, -6 to 13 mm), and the median 1-leg hop test quotient was 95% (0% to 167%) compared with the contralateral normal side. At follow-up, 69.3% of the patients were classified as normal or nearly normal according to the International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation system. However, 36% of the patients were unable to or had severe problems performing the knee-walking test. Inferior results correlated with increased time period between the index injury and reconstruction and concomitant joint damage found at the index operation. Conclusions: Overall, the results were good after ACL reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft and interference screw fixation. Concomitant joint damage and a long time period between the injury and reconstruction are major risk factors for inferior outcome after ACL reconstruction.

With these screws, there is no need for a second operation for removal and no complicating factor if later revision surgery is necessary. Several pullout studies have found similar results between metal and bioabsorbable interference screws; however, few studies have investigated the clinical outcome. Hypothesis: There is no difference in the clinical outcome of bioabsorbable interference screws compared with metal screws. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Forty-one patients were randomized for the use of either metal interference screws (20 patients) or bioabsorbable poly-L-lactic acid screws (21 patients). The patients were followed with clinical examinations at 6, 12, and 24 weeks and at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Results: Subjective knee function was better in the patients in the metal screw group; they had less pain at rest, a higher Tegner score, a higher Lysholm score, and better subjective knee function at 2 years compared to the bioabsorbable screw group. However, there was no difference in stability between the groups. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: Because of the inferior results in the bioabsorbable screw group in our study, and until larger studies show otherwise, we do not find the advantages of using bioabsorbable screws sufficient to warrant the routine use of poly-L-lactic acid screws in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. © 2005 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction; Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture; Bioabsorbable interference screw; Patellar tendon graft; Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA)","metal; polylactic acid; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bioabsorbable interference screw; biodegradable implant; bone graft; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; endoscopic surgery; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; joint stability; Kirschner wire; knee function; knee pain; ligament surgery; Lysholm score; male; occupational accident; patella tendon; physiotherapy; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sport injury; surgical technique; tegner score; tendon graft; treatment outcome; Absorbable Implants; Bone Screws; Bone Transplantation; Endoscopy; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Lactic Acid; Male; Metals; Polymers; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome","","polylactic acid, 26100-51-6; Lactic Acid, 50-21-5; Metals, 0; poly(lactic acid), 26100-51-6; Polymers, 0","BioScrew, Linvatec; KT-1000, Medmetric","Linvatec; Medmetric","","","Abate, Joseph A., Initial fixation strength of polylactic acid interference screws in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 14, 3, pp. 278-284, (1998); Alan Barber, F., Bioscrew fixation of patellar tendon autografts, Biomaterials, 21, 24, pp. 2623-2629, (2000); Benedetto, Karl Peter, A new bioabsorbable interference screw: Preliminary results of a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, Arthroscopy, 16, 1, pp. 41-48, (2000); Caborn, David N.M., Biomechanical comparison between BioScrew and titanium alloy interference screws for bone-patellar tendon-bone graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 13, 2, pp. 229-232, (1997); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior knee laxity in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament disruption, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 6, pp. 401-407, (1985); Drogset, Jon Olav, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with and without a ligament augmentation device: Results at 8-year follow-up, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 6, pp. 851-856, (2002); Freehill, Michael Q., Poly-L-lactic acid tack synovitis after arthroscopic stabilization of the shoulder, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 31, 5, pp. 643-647, (2003); Fridèn, Thomas, Severe aseptic synovitis of the knee after biodegradable internal fixation: A case report, Acta Orthopaedica, 63, 1, pp. 94-97, (1992); Hackl, Wolfgang, Metall- versus bioabsorbable polyglyconate interference screw for graft fixation in ACL reconstruction: A prospective randomized study of 40 patients, Unfallchirurg, 103, 6, pp. 468-478, (2000); Hawkins, Richard J., Followup of the acute nonoperated isolated anterior cruciate ligament tear, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 3, pp. 205-210, (1986)","J.O.

There were 20 ST and 21 PT reconstructions. No difference existed between the groups in terms of associated lesion and time from injury to surgery. Synovial sample was collected at 6 weeks, 3 months and 18 months after the operation. No difference was noted between the groups at 18 months in terms of activity level and functional scores. Both groups demonstrated a sudden increase of PF at 6 weeks with respect to preoperative quantities (p<0.0001). A significant decrease occurred in the PT group at 3 months (p<0.008). Even at 18 months, it was significantly below the preoperative values (p<0.004). However, the decrease in ST cases relative to 6 weeks was insignificant at 3 months and quantities did not drop below the preoperative levels at 18 month (p=0.79). These results confirm again a gradual decrease of PF values in PT-reconstructed knees depending on time and surgery. Reconstruction with quadruple ST does not seem to have the same effect until 18 months postoperatively. Achievement of almost the same level of activity and function in both groups does not necessarily reflect the molecular status. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Cartilage; Knee injury; Proteoglycan; Synovial fluid","proteoglycan; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; convalescence; female; follow up; human; injury; knee injury; knee meniscus; male; metabolism; methodology; orthopedic surgery; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Orthopedic Procedures; Proteoglycans; Recovery of Function; Treatment Outcome","","Proteoglycans, 0","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 4, pp. 510-516, (1992); Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Dahlberg, Leif E., A longitudinal study of cartilage matrix metabolism in patients with cruciate ligament rupture-synovial fluid concentrations of aggrecan fragments, stromelysin-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, Rheumatology, 33, 12, pp. 1107-1111, (1994); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Dejour, Henri, Arthrosis of the knee in chronic anterior laxity, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 73, 3, pp. 157-170, (1987); Dye, Scott F., Restoration of osseous homeostasis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 5, pp. 748-750, (1993); Dye, Scott F., Factors contributing to function of the knee joint after injury or reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 80, 9, pp. 1380-1393, (1998); Ejerhed, Lars Erik, Patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?

In this study, the long-term results of 95 patients at a mean follow-up of 10.7 years were assessed. The ACL was reconstructed using a patellar tendon autograft with a press-fit fixation. Between 1987 and 1991, 159 patients were operated by the senior author (PH), 95 could be seen for follow-up. Evaluation included detailed history, physical examination, functional knee ligament testing, KT-1000 arthrometer testing, the IKDC standard evaluation form, Lysholm, Flandry, and Tegner scoring systems. Radiographs were obtained preoperatively and at follow-up to assess the grade of osteoarthritis. Subjectively, none of the patients that were seen for follow-up complained of instability. Numbness of the skin was reported by 54% of the patients and pain during knee walking was described as mild in 25% and severe in 2%. The mean Flandry score was 243 (max: 280). The mean Lysholm score was 93.2 at follow-up and the Tegner activity level was 6.8 preinjury and 6.0 postoperatively. The average KT-1000 side-to-side difference was 1.8 mm on a manual maximum pull. The IKDC knee scoring revealed 84% of the patients with normal (A) or nearly normal (B) knee joints, 15% were (C), 1% was (D). Radiographically, joint space narrowing was found in 19%, 15%, and 25% for the patello-femoral, medial, and lateral compartments, respectively. Meniscus surgery was a determining factor. This study presents long-term clinical data on a press-fit fixation for ACL reconstruction. Results were excellent and good in more then 80% of the followed patients. The advantages of the press-fit fixation are direct bone-to-bone healing of the graft, decreased donor site morbidity, cost-effectiveness and ease for revision surgery. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","ACL reconstruction; BTB; IKDC; Long-term follow-up; Press-fit","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; computer assisted tomography; female; follow up; human; injury; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; patella; plastic surgery; retrospective study; sport injury; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Athletic Injuries; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Tendons; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Al-Husseiny, Moustafa, Press-fit fixation in reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament, using bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 12, 2, pp. 104-109, (2004); Behrend, Henrik, Results of the surgical treatment of arthrofibrosis of the knee, Unfallchirurg, 106, 6, pp. 483-491, (2003); Bonatus, Timothy J., Patellar fracture and avulsion of the patellar ligament complicating arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Orthopaedic Review, 20, 9, pp. 770-774, (1991); Boszotta, Harald, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft in press-fit technique: Surgical technique and follow-up, Arthroscopy, 13, 3, pp. 332-339, (1997); Bouchard, Claude, Fracture of the patella during rehabilitation of the knee extensor muscles following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A brief report, Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 3, 2, pp. 118-122, (1993); Châtain, Frédéric, A comparative study of medial versus lateral arthroscopic partial meniscectomy on stable knees: 10-Year minimum follow-up, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 19, 8, pp. 842-849, (2003); Christen, B., Fractures associated with patellar ligament grafts in cruciate ligament surgery, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 74, 4, pp. 617-619, (1992); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Deehan, David John, Endoscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with an ipsilateral patellar tendon autograft, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 82, 7, pp. 984-991, (2000)","H.

Materials and methods: The study included 88 cases (88 knees). Group A comprised 43 knees with the reinforcement and group B 45 knees with BTB alone. Both groups were evaluated by second-look arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), manual testing, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and histopathological evaluation more than 2 years after the reconstruction. Results: In the second-look arthroscopic findings, 84% of the reconstructed ACL in group A had good appearance, and no fibrous split was observed. The ratio of fibrous disorder was significantly less in group A in comparison with group B (p =0.0037). Distinct reduction of the tension of the reconstructed ligament was observed in 9% of group A and 36% of group B (p =0.0088). Regarding the results of the Lachman test, the ratio of the negative group was higher in group A (p =0.0067). In the MRI findings fulfilled pictures to the inside of the reconstructed ligament were observed in 77% of the patients photographed in group A. In contrast, the fibrous split was observed in 55% in group B. Conclusions: Reinforcement by wrapping with the ITT flap for the BTB autograft was effective in ACL reconstruction. The ratio of fibrous disorder and reduction of tension in the reconstructed ligament decreased. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","ACL reconstruction; Bone-patellar tendon-bone; Iliotibial tract; Reinforcement; Second-look arthroscopy","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; controlled study; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; knee arthroscopy; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; scoring system; surgical approach; surgical technique; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Fibrosis; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Patella; Regeneration; S100 Proteins; Second-Look Surgery; Surgical Flaps; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","S100 Proteins, 0","","","","","Anderson, Allen F., Analysis of the intercondylar notch by computed tomography, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 6, pp. 547-552, (1987); Asahina, Shintaro, Evaluation of anterior cruciate reconstruction reinforced by the Kennedy ligament augmentation device - An arthroscopic and histological study, International Orthopaedics, 19, 4, pp. 229-233, (1995); Atkinson, Theresa Staton, The tensile and stress relaxation responses of human patellar tendon varies with specimen cross-sectional area, Journal of Biomechanics, 32, 9, pp. 907-914, (1999); Clancy, William G., Intra-articular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 16, 2, pp. 181-189, (1985); Eriksson, Ejnar, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 7, 1, pp. 167-179, (1976); Good, Lars, Precision in reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A new positioning device compared with hand drilling, Acta Orthopaedica, 58, 6, pp. 658-661, (1987); Grøntvedt, Torbjørn, Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts with and without augmentation, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 78, 5, pp. 817-822, (1996); Harter, Rod A., Long-term evaluation of knee stability and function following surgical reconstruction for anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 16, 5, pp. 434-443, (1988); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993); Herzog, Richard Joseph, Measurements of the Intercondylar Notch by Plain Film Radiography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 204-210, (1994)","M.

Type of Study: Ex vivo controlled biomechanical study. Methods: An ACL reconstruction was performed on 2 groups of 40 sheep each. The ACL graft was patellar tendon in group 1, and free tendon in group 2. Load-to-failure tests were performed at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups: In subgroup A the femoral fixation devices were removed before testing and in subgroup B they were left in place. Results: At 1 month, structural properties of subgroup 2A were significantly lower than other subgroups. Until the third month, structural properties of each subgroup were significantly lower than normal ACL. Grafts always failed at midsubstance, except for subgroup 2A at 1 month, which pulled out of the femoral tunnel. Conclusions: Bone plug incorporation was stronger than graft strength at 1 month whereas soft tissue tendon incorporation was not stronger than graft until 2 months. At 3 months, both groups failed at approximately 30% of the native ACL strength, and at 6 months, both groups were nearly equal in terms of load to failure and stiffness. Clincial Relevance: High fixation strength and stiffness of ACL graft does not allow earlier return to sports activities. © 2005 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Biomechanics; Graft; Junction; Reconstruction","animal experiment; animal tissue; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; biomechanics; controlled study; device; femur; fracture fixation; graft failure; intermethod comparison; joint stiffness; loading test; nonhuman; patella tendon; physical activity; sheep; soft tissue; sport; statistical significance; tendon graft; time series analysis; Animals; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Femur; Models, Animal; Orthopedic Fixation Devices; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Sheep; Tibia; Time Factors; Treatment Failure; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Panni, A.

Methods: Forty-five patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament operation in the Department of Orthopaedics, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-en University from September 1999 to September 2002 were divided into conservative rehabilitation regime group(n = 24) and accelerated rehabilitation regime group(n = 21). The two groups were treated with conservative and accelerated rehabilitation regimes respectively. The knee function and stability were detected 2 years after operation, and the therapeutic effect was assessed. Results: Two years after operation, the measurement of joint laxity was positive in 4 cases(17%) in conservative rehabilitation regime group and in 4 cases(19%) in accelerated rehabilitation regime group, and both of the two groups were found poor in 1 case for the Lysholm score of knee joint. There were no significant difference in knee joint and stability between the two groups(P > 0.05). Joint swelling and effusion were found more in accelerated rehabilitation regime group. Aspiration was performed more frequently in the accelerated rehabilitation regime group(15 cases) than in the conservative rehabilitation regime group(10 cases) (P < 0.05). The training time for normal joint movement was 1 year for the accelerated rehabilitation regime group, and 9 months for the conservative rehabilitation regime group. Conclusion: Either of the two rehabilitation regimes is effective, but the accelerated rehabilitation can obviously shorten the time for rehabilitation and accelerate the recovery of knee joint function.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthrocentesis; arthroscopy; article; bone graft; China; clinical article; conservative treatment; controlled study; female; human; intermethod comparison; joint effusion; joint laxity; knee function; knee instability; ligament surgery; male; orthopedics; patella; postoperative care; postoperative period; scoring system; tendon graft","","","","","","","undefined, (2003); Shelbourne, K.

These changes seem to be of no clinical significance in a short to midterm follow-up. We investigated if a synthetic graft evokes the same bone tunnel widening and if it is of clinical significance in a longterm follow-up. Methods: We examined 17 patients, 13-15 years after their anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a Gore-Tex ligament prosthesis. The follow-up consisted of clinical examination, K-1000 arthrometric measurement, Tegner, Lysholm and IKDC scores, and CT examination of their tibia bone tunnels. 6 patients had been reoperated before follow-up, 3 because of graft rupture and 3 because of effusion and/or pain. Results: 5 patients were graded as normal (n = 2) or nearly normal according to the IKDC score, and 4 of these patients still had their Gore-Tex prosthesis intact. 15 of the patients had a tibia bone tunnel wider than the drilled 7.9 mm diameter, ranging from 9.6 to 26 mm. These changes in the bone tunnels were in some cases without symptoms and could not be detected with arthroscopy, clinical examination, arthrometry or evaluation scores. We do not know whether they are progressive. Interpretation; Based on our findings, we recommend that patients who have had a Gore-Tex anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction should be examined not only clinically or by questionnaire, but also with CT.

Hypothesis: Rehabilitation with either an accelerated or nonaccelerated program produces no difference in anterior-posterior knee laxity, clinical assessment, patient satisfaction, functional performance, and the synovial fluid biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Twenty-five patients who tore their anterior cruciate ligament were enrolled and underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were randomized to accelerated rehabilitation or nonaccelerated rehabilitation. At the time of surgery and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months later, measurements of anterior-posterior knee laxity, clinical assessment, patient satisfaction, functional performance, and cartilage metabolism were completed. Results: At the 2-year follow-up, there was no difference in the increase of anterior knee laxity relative to the baseline values that were obtained immediately after surgery between the 2 groups (2.2-mm vs 1.8-mm increase relative to the normal knee). The groups were similar in terms of clinical assessment, patient satisfaction, activity level, function, and response of the biomarkers. After 1 year of healing, synthesis of collagen and turnover of aggrecan remained elevated in both groups. Conclusion: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft followed by either accelerated or nonaccelerated rehabilitation produces the same increase of anterior knee laxity. Both programs had the same effect in terms of clinical assessment, patient satisfaction, functional performance, and the biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism. There is concern that the cartilage biomarkers remained elevated for an extended period.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Biomarkers; Reconstruction; Rehabilitation","aggrecan; biological marker; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; articular cartilage; bone patellar tendon bone graft; clinical article; clinical trial; collagen synthesis; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; follow up; functional assessment; graft failure; health program; human; immobilization; joint function; joint laxity; knee arthroplasty; ligament surgery; male; patient compliance; patient satisfaction; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation; scoring system; synovial fluid level; tegner scale; tendon graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biological Markers; Cartilage, Articular; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Procedures; Patient Satisfaction; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rehabilitation; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","","Biological Markers, 0","","","","","Ageberg, Eva, Stabilometry and one-leg hop test have high test-retest reliability, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 8, 4, pp. 198-202, (1998); Akeson, Wayne H., Immobility effects on synovial joints the pathomechanics of joint contracture, Biorheology, 17, 1-2, pp. 95-110, (1980); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior cruciate ligament strain in-vivo: A review of previous work, Journal of Biomechanics, 31, 6, pp. 519-525, (1998); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain Behavior During Rehabilitation Exercises In Vivo, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 24-34, (1995); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior cruciate ligament replacement: Comparison of bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts with two-strand hamstring grafts.

Type of study: Multicentered prospective randomized study. Methods: Two surgeons performed primary ACL reconstructions at different locations. Preoperatively, the patients were randomly assigned. One group received a titanium cannulated interference screw. The second group received the cannulated poly-L-lactic bioabsorbable Phantom screw. Data included subjective evaluation of activity level and International Knee Documentation Committee scores. Objective measures were made using the KT-1000 arthrometer (MedMetric, San Diego, CA), range of motion, presence of effusions, and complications intraoperatively or postoperatively. Measurements were made at 1 year and 2 years. Radiographic evaluation was carried out at least 2 years from the initial surgical date and interpreted by 2 independent orthopaedic surgeons. Results: At the 1-year follow-up (N = 97), pain was reported more during moderate activity in the Phantom screw group (6) compared with the titanium screw group (0) (P =. 03). No statistical difference between range of motion (P =. 45), activity level (P =. 83), swelling with activity (P =. 95), partial (P =. 13) or full (P =. 31) giving way, knee effusions (P =. 33), or KT-1000 side-to-side difference (P =. 53) were found. At the 2-year follow-up (N = 65), more subjects (18) in the Phantom interference screw group reported activity levels in the strenuous category compared with those in the titanium interference screws (7) group (P =. 02). No differences were reported with respect to pain (P =. 97), effusion (P =. 17), partial (P =. 28) or full (P =. 27) giving way, swelling with activity (P =. 21), range of motion (P =. 64), or KT-1000 side-to-side difference (P =. 96). Radiographic inspection showed no change in bone plug position, osteolysis, adverse effect, or complication caused by the bioabsorbable material. Some evidence of tunnel widening was seen in both groups. Conclusions: Use of a poly-L-lactic bioabsorbable interference screw can provide clinical results equal to that of a metal interference screw for fixation of a central third bone-patellar tendon-bone graft in ACL reconstruction.

Few studies have evaluated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction under physiological loads. Purpose: To determine whether anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction reproduced knee motion under simulated muscle loads. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Eight human cadaveric knees were tested with the anterior cruciate ligament intact, transected, and reconstructed (using a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft) on a robotic testing system. Tibial translation and rotation were measured at 0°, 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion under anterior drawer loading (130 N), quadriceps muscle loading (400 N), and combined quadriceps and hamstring muscle loading (400 N and 200 N, respectively). Repeated-measures analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used to detect statistically significant differences between knee states. Results: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction resulted in a clinically satisfactory anterior tibial translation. The anterior tibial translation of the reconstructed knee was 1.93 mm larger than the intact knee at 30° of flexion under anterior load. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction overconstrained tibial rotation, causing significantly less internal tibial rotation in the reconstructed knee at low flexion angles (0°-30°) under muscle loads (P < .05). At 30° of flexion, under muscle loads, the tibia of the reconstructed knee was 1.9° externally rotated compared to the intact knee. Conclusions: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may not restore the rotational kinematics of the intact knee under muscle loads, even though anterior tibial translation was restored to a clinically satisfactory level under anterior drawer loads. These data suggest that reproducing anterior stability under anterior tibial loads may not ensure that knee joint kinematics is restored under physiological loading conditions. Clinical Relevance: Decreased internal rotation of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may lead to increased patellofemoral joint contact pressures. Future anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques should aim at restoring 3-dimensional knee kinematics under physiological loads.","ACL reconstruction; Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Biomechanics; Muscle loads; Robotic testing","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; cadaver; controlled study; hamstring; human; human tissue; joint function; joint stability; kinematics; ligament surgery; muscle function; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; robotics; rotation; simulation; surgical technique; weight bearing; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Muscle, Skeletal; Robotics; Rotation; Rupture","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 4, pp. 510-516, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Anderson, Allen F., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

METHODS: From January 2002 to June 2003, 12 cases whose anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were elongated accepted the therapy of bipolar radiofrequency energy during arthroscopy. The 12 patients included 11 men and 1 woman with an average age of 30 years ranging from 18 to 45 years old. The ACL grafts were composed of 5 patellar tendons and 7 semitendinosus tendons. The elongated reconstruction were treated by bipolar radiofrequency energy with an output of 284W. This was continued until the elongated reconstruction were tight. After the operation, the patients received unlimited orthosis and were conducted to do functional exercise of the knees. All the patients were followed up. The Lysholm-Tegner score and clinical examination of the knees were recorded and analyzed statistically with paired t text. RESULTS: The elongated ACL reconstruction became shrinkage and tighten after treated by bipolar radiofrequency energy. The palpation by hook and Lachman test showed negative results. The follow-up time was 5-13 months, averaged 8 months. The postoperative mean Lysholm-Tegner score of the knee was 88.5, which was significantly higher than that of preoperative score of 45.5 (P < 0.01). All the patients had no postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: By application of bipolar radiofrequency energy, the elongated ACL reconstruction can be shrunk and tightened to make the knees stabilize. The shrinkage procedure is simple, convenient and effective.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; catheter ablation; female; follow up; human; male; methodology; middle aged; orthopedic surgery; postoperative complication; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Catheter Ablation; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Procedures; Postoperative Complications; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","B.C.

The aim of this work was to compare our results of the artroscopic reconstruction ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) of the knee using two different technics.We were controling 60 patients within the period of two years after operation.Group A was composed of 39 patients which had reconstructed ACL done with bone-patella tendon- bone autografts, in the group B were 21 patients and at them as autographts have been used hamstring tendon. Difference between healthe and the ill knee by the Lachman's test after operation, in the group A was 2,4 mm, but in the group B was 2,2mm (p> 0,05 ). Postoperative middle value of the Lysholm and Gillquist score in the group A was 97,74, in the group B it was 96,67 (p>0,05). IKDC score results are following: Group A- mark A 32 patients (84,6%); mark B 5 (12,8%); mark C 1 (2,6%) and in the group B: mark A 17 patients (81%); mark B 3 (14,28%): mark C 1 (4,72%) (p> 0,05). Postoperative value for the Tegner and Lyscholm score activity in the A group was 8,23, in B group it was 8,81. The reconstruction of ACL with bone- patella tendon-bone grafts gave better results then the reconstruction with the hamstring tendon only according to Tegner score values. In other parameters between those two groups there was no statisticaly significant difference.","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone patellar tendon bone graft; comparative study; follow up; human; methodology; orthopedic surgery; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Graft; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Orthopedic Procedures; Tendons; Treatment Outcome; MLCS; MLOWN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0354950X","","","16237902","Croatian","Acta Chir Iugosl","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33744465299"

We hypothesized that patient demographics, mechanism of injury, and intra-articular injuries and their treatment are factors associated with function five years after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods: A consecutive series of unilateral, arthroscopically assisted primary reconstructions of the anterior cruciate ligament performed by one surgeon using a patellar tendon graft was evaluated. Data on patient demographics, injury variables, and intra-articular lesions noted at the time of surgery were collected prospectively. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of outcomes as measured with five questionnaires. Results: Sixty-nine percent (217) of 314 knees with a reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament were followed for an average of 5.4 years. The average age at the time of the operation was twenty-seven years. Independent predictors of a worse outcome, which was measured with the overall Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, the International Knee Documentation Committee score, the Lysholm score, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score, included the patient's recollection of hearing or feeling a pop at the time of the injury, a weight gain of >15 lb (6.8 kg), and no change in educational level since the surgery. There was a lack of association between the outcome and either the occurrence or the form of treatment of a meniscal tear or chondromalacia of the articular cartilage. Conclusions: To our knowledge, we performed the first prospective cohort study to evaluate the prognosis following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by identifying significant associations between multiple variables and clinical outcomes as measured with validated questionnaires. The clinician can counsel patients about the intermediate-term functional outcomes of reconstructions of the anterior cruciate ligament on the basis of these findings. Suggestions regarding weight control and future education may improve intermediate-term outcomes. Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level II.

Type of study: A prospective randomized comparison of patellar tendon (PT) versus semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (STG) autografts for ACL reconstruction. Methods: Between 1994 and 1996, 85 consecutive male patients with chronic ACL-deficient knees underwent arthroscopically assisted reconstruction with either autologous PT or double-loop STG (4-strand) graft. PT grafts were used in patients with even-numbered birth dates and STG grafts for those with odd-numbered birth dates. Preoperatively, no significant differences between the 2 groups were noted with respect to age, level of activity, and degree of laxity (χ-square analysis). A standardized rehabilitation program was used for both groups postoperatively that included immediate active extension and early weight bearing and gradual flexion. Return to sports was permitted 8 months postoperatively. Assessment of the patients was carried out using a questionnaire, clinical assessment, Lysholm knee scores, the International Knee Documentation Committee scale, and radiological examination. Results: At a mean follow-up of 81 months, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to subjective complaints (recurrent giving way, functional level) or objective laxity evaluation, including KT-1000 measurement or return to sports. Loss of extension of ≤5° was greater in the PT group (12 patients, 30%) than in the STG group (8 patients, 17%). There was loss of flexion of ≤15° in 5 patients (12%) in the PT group and 1 patient (2.2%) in the STG group. Anterior knee pain was recorded in 10 patients (24%) in the PT group and 3 patients (5%) in the STG group. The Lysholm knee score was 91.6 and 92.7 for the PT and STG groups, respectively, and the Tegner activity score decreased from 8.9 preoperatively for both groups to 7.9 for the PT group and 7.8 for the STG group. Conclusion: In this study, the 2 groups had comparable results in terms of patient satisfaction, activity level, and knee function. Our study showed that patellofemoral problems and loss of knee motion are more frequent in patients with PT grafts than in those with STG grafts.

Musculo-Skeletal R., Sydney, NS, Australia, ","Background: Female patients undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a hamstring tendon graft developed increased postoperative laxity compared to male and female patients who had reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft. This difference may be due to graft slippage in less dense female tibial bone. Hypothesis: Reinforcement of tibial fixation of the hamstring tendon graft in women by supplementary methods may reduce laxity. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Fifty-six female patients divided into 2 groups (standard tibial fixation with 7 x 25-mm metal interference screw versus metal interference screw with supplementary staple fixation) were followed for 2 years. Results: After 2 years, the mean side-to-side difference using KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum measurements was 1.8 mm (standard group) and 1.1 mm (staple group) (P = .05). The percentage of patients with a side-to-side difference of <3 mm did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P = .66): 88.8% of the standard group versus 90.5% of the staple group. A grade 0 Lachman test result was present in 63% of the standard group and 86% of the staple group (P = .04). Kneeling pain was experienced by 7% of the standard group and 29% of the staple group (P = .05). Conclusions: Supplementary tibial fixation in female patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft in addition to a single-size screw significantly improves laxity measurements and clinical stability assessment 2 years after surgery. However, this improvement is at the cost of increased kneeling pain.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Female patients; Fixation; Hamstring; Laxity","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; follow up; hamstring; human; implant; joint laxity; knee pain; ligament surgery; major clinical study; postoperative complication; priority journal; prosthesis fixation; randomized controlled trial; tendon graft; tibia; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Screws; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Patella; Sex Factors; Suture Techniques; Tendons; Tibia; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Arnold, Christopher A., The relationship between serum relaxin and knee joint laxity in female athletes, Orthopedics, 25, 6, pp. 669-673, (2002); Bak, Klaus, Results of reconstruction of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament with an iliotibial band autograft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 2, pp. 111-117, (1999); Bhandari, Mohit, The quality of reporting of randomized trials in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery from 1988 through 2000, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 84, 3, pp. 388-Adv98, (2002); Billotti, Joseph D., A prospective, clinical study evaluating arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using the semitendinosus and iliotibial band: 2- to 5-year follow up, Orthopedics, 20, 2, pp. 125-131, (1997); Blecher, Andrew M., Transient laxity of an anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knee related to pregnancy, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 14, 1, pp. 77-79, (1998); Boyd, Steven K., Early regional adaptation of periarticular bone mineral density after anterior cruciate ligament injury, Journal of Applied Physiology, 89, 6, pp. 2359-2364, (2000); Brodie, Jeffrey T., Femoral interference screw placement through the tibial tunnel: A radiographic evaluation of interference screw divergence angles after endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 12, 4, pp. 435-440, (1996); Corry, Ian S., Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Hypothesis: Differences in initial graft tension will affect postoperative knee stability. Study Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Methods: Forty-nine patients undergoing bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by a single surgeon were randomized into high-tension (n = 27) and low-tension (n = 22) groups. Grafts were set at 90 N or 45 N. Arthrometric measurements (KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum) of anterior tibial displacement and knee range of motion were made before surgery and at 1 week and an average of 20 months after surgery. Knee outcome scores were collected before and after surgery, and a single-leg hop test was also performed at final follow-up. Results: After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, anterior tibial displacement was significantly greater in the patients in the low-tension group (P < .05). The side-to-side difference in anterior tibial displacement in the high-tension and low-tension groups was 1.1 ± 1.7 mm versus 2.4 ± 2.4 mm 1 week after surgery and 2.2 ± 1.6 mm versus 3.0 ± 2.2 mm at follow-up. Five patients had abnormal anterior tibial displacement (>5 mm side-to-side difference), and all were in the low-tension group (P < .05). Knee outcome scores improved with surgery (P < .01), with similar results for low-tension and high-tension groups. Hop test deficits were not different between groups. Conclusions: Initial graft tension affects the restoration of knee stability. A graft tension of 45 N was not sufficient for restoring knee stability.","Anterior tibial displacement; Arthrometer; Arthroscopy; KT-1000","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autograft; biomechanics; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; follow up; human; joint mobility; knee arthroplasty; knee instability; male; outcomes research; patella; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; tension; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendon Transfer; Tendons; Tensile Strength","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopically assisted semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft in reconstruction for acute anterior cruciate ligament injuries in athletes, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 6, pp. 726-731, (1996); Trans Orthop Res Soc, (1990); Beynnon, Bruce D., The measurement of elongation of anterior cruciate-ligament grafts in vivo, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 76, 4, pp. 520-531, (1994); Burks, Robert T., Determination of graft tension before fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 4, 4, pp. 260-266, (1988); Bylski-Austrow, Donita I., Anterior cruciate ligament replacements: A mechanical study of femoral attachment location, flexion angle at tensioning, and initial tension, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 8, 4, pp. 522-531, (1990); Trans Orthop Res Soc, (1987); Fleming, Braden C., Effect of tension and placement of a prosthetic anterior cruciate ligament on the anteroposterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 10, 2, pp. 177-186, (1992); Fu, Freddie H., Current trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Part II.

Patients were selected because of graft choosing (BPTB), kind of fixation (double interference screw fixation) and were divided on two groups: Group A (40 patients) Patients with ACL reconstruction and internal meniscectomy; Group B (38 patients) Patients with ACL reconstruction without any associated lesion. Patients with external meniscal as well as cartilage lesions were excluded of the study. Patients were evaluated by IKDC form, KT 1000 and by X-Ray (lounge cassette AP orthostatic position and Rosemberg view), evaluated by Fairbank signs and Ahlbäck classification score. Proprioception sensibility was assessed by oscillometer table (Libra, Easytech). Our study did not detect any differences between the two group in term of stability (KT 1000) and clinical observation (IKDC). On X-ray study 28 patients belonged to the group A and all the patients inside group B showed a grade 0 on Ahlbäck score. On 12 patients the articular line were decreased (Grade 1). On 9 patients proprioception tests showed a score lower than the other. All this patients belonged to the group A and all of them had a follow-up longer than seven years. In conclusion internal meniscectomy doesn't affect clinical result at short term follow-up, however X-ray findings and proprioceptive results might suggest that a longer follow-up could reveal possible clinical differences.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Internal meniscus; Knee; Meniscus; Surgery","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroplasty; article; bone screw; clinical feature; clinical observation; controlled study; disease classification; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; joint stability; knee radiography; long term care; major clinical study; medical assessment; meniscectomy; oscillometry; outcomes research; plastic surgery; proprioception; questionnaire; radiological procedures; sensibility; surgical technique","","","","","","","Cipolla, Massimo, Different patterns of meniscal tears in acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures and in chronic ACL-deficient knees - Classification, staging and timing of treatment, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 3, pp. 130-134, (1995); Murrell, G.

This is a retrospective comparative study with statistical analysis. Methods: In this study, 85 patients were operated in the Armed Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between December 1998 and December 2001, and underwent rehabilitation with a minimum follow up of 2 years. The patients were split into 2 groups. Group A consist of 32 patients and they underwent the standard rehabilitation program according to established braced programs. Group B is the subsequent 53 consecutive patients who were subjected to aggressive brace-free rehabilitation program. All knees were measured for Tegner and Lysholm scores as the main indicator of assessment in the preinjury hindsight appraisal, and compared with scores obtained 4 months and 2 years post reconstruction. Results: Linking the preinjury Tegner and Lysholm scores to the 4 months follow up scores for group A, there was a mean loss of 1.9 and 14 constituting 26% and 22.2% (p=0.015), range 1.07-3.5 and 9.8-23.5. Linking the preinjury Tegner and Lysholm scores to the 4 months follow up scores for group B, there was a mean loss of 1.1 and 9.0 constituting 15.4% and 13.6% (p=0.012), range 0.67-3.5 and 6.8-13.5. When comparing the preinjury Tegner and Lysholm scores to the 2 years follow up scores for group A, there was a mean loss of 1.0 and 8.0 constituting 13.6% and 11.6% (p=0.024), range 0.67-3.5 and 6.8-13.5. When comparing the preinjury Tegner and Lysholm scores to 2 years follow up scores for group B, there was a mean loss of 0.4 and 1.0 constituting 5.5% and 1.5% (p=0.015), range 0.1-1.5 and 6.8-13.5. Appraisal of the aggregate data of 2 groups has shown that the loss from preinjury Tegner and Lysholm scores was 20.7% versus 16.9% lower at 4 months (p=0.013), but only 12.6% versus 3.55% lower at 2 years (p=0.036). Conclusion: Results of aggressive rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction both subjectively and clinically are superior to that of the standard braced rehabilitation. A better prognostic result with aggressive rehabilitation can be predicted for patients with high preinjury scores compared to patients with a low preinjury score. The result of this study support the use of accelerated brace free rehabilitation in autogenous patellar tendon graft, and has shown that intensive rehabilitation facilitate return to sport activities at 4 months postoperatively.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; brace; comparative study; controlled study; follow up; functional assessment; human; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; methodology; patella tendon; prediction; prognosis; Saudi Arabia; scoring system; statistical analysis; treatment outcome; work resumption; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Braces; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Tendon Transfer; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

We performed a prospective clinical evaluation with the IKDC form and computed tomography (CT) scans 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with the bonepatellar tendon-bone (BPTB) technique. A total of 20 patients was divided into five groups according to the type of screw used for the femoral fixation (half-tunnel technique): group A, poly L-lactic acid; group B, polyglyconate copolymer; group C, lactic acid and glycolic acid copolymer; group D, polylactic acid; and group E (control), titanium. Proximal bone graft integration was always achieved within 6 and 12 months. Cystic bone absorption was observed in two group A patients. Ten screws were absorbed (9 completely; 1 partially): 1 completely and 1 partially in group A at 9 and 24 months; 4 in Group B between 12 and 18 months; 4 in Group C (2 each at 12 and 24 months); and none in Group D. The IKDC ratings were: group A, four patients with A; group B, 2 with A, 1 with B and 1 with C; group C, 2 with A, 2 with B; group D, 4 with A. Effusion that resolved within 6 months was noted in 2 group A and 2 group C patients. One patient in group B had a traumatic re-rupture of the graft; the screw was not found when he was re-operated at 18 months. The four bioabsorbable interference screws provided safe and effective bone block fixation during ACL reconstruction. Their 93.75% excellent and good overall IKDC results were in line with those achieved with metal interference screws. The fact that none of the group D screws (polylactic acid) were absorbed at 2 years indicates that absorption of polylactic acid is a slow biological process. This is also suggested by the absence of effusion in this group. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2004.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bioabsorbable screws; Graft fixation","biomaterial; maxon; polyglactin; polylactic acid; titanium; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; biodegradable implant; bone screw; clinical article; clinical examination; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; effusion; female; graft failure; human; intermethod comparison; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; priority journal; prospective study; reoperation; safety; treatment outcome","","maxon, 75734-93-9; polyglactin, 26780-50-7, 34346-01-5; polylactic acid, 26100-51-6; titanium, 7440-32-6","","","","","Kurosaka, Masahiro, A biomechanical comparison of different surgical techniques of graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 225-229, (1987); Am J Knee Surg, (1989); Acufex Microsurgery Technical Bulletin, (1991); Weiler, Andreas, Biodegradable implants in sports medicine: The biological base, Arthroscopy, 16, 3, pp. 305-321, (2000); Pistner, Hans, Poly(l-lactide): a long-term degradation study in vivo.

A total number of 39 patients with a mean age of 37.1 years was followed for an average of 116.7 month. Stability of the knee was evaluated using Lachmann and Pivot shift test, 79.5% of the knees were stable. An additional KT-1000 arthrometer measurement showed a mean side-to-side difference of 1.7 mm, in 69.2% the difference was less than 2 mm. The evaluated knee score systems showed excellent results, mean Lysholm score was at 93.7, in Tegner activity score 87.2% of the patients regained their pre-injury activity level. In IKDC grading 89.7% of the knees were rated normal (A) or nearly normal (B) and asked for a personal assessment of their knee function 94.9% of the patients rated A or B, expressing a high grade of satisfaction with the long-term outcome of surgical treatment. The postoperative course of osteoarthritis showed a deterioration on the IKDC scale in 23.1%, in 7.7% with signs of progressive osteoarthritis of grade C. A high significant correlation (p < 0.01) was detected for progression of osteoarthritis and laxity of reconstruction more than 2 mm in side-to-side difference in the KT-1000 measurement. Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using a bone-tendon-bone autograft of the patellar ligament leads to excellent long-term results in respect to joint stability, clinical function and subjective satisfaction of patients. If progression of radiographic signs of osteoarthritis in some of the knees will lead to marked deterioration of clinical function and high level of patient's satisfaction has to be subject to further clinical long-term trials.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthrometer; article; autograft; clinical article; clinical feature; correlation analysis; deterioration; device; evaluation; female; human; injury scale; joint stability; knee function; ligament surgery; long term care; male; measurement; osteoarthritis; patella tendon; patient satisfaction; postoperative period; scoring system; statistical significance; tendon graft","","","KT-1000 arthrometer","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Knee Surgery, (1994); Andersson, Christer A., Treatment of acute isolated and combined ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament: A long-term follow-up study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 7-12, (1992); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

Another goal was to analyze and compare the knee laxity of the right and left knees in a group of persons without any known knee problems. Prospective examination of the same patients preoperatively and 2 years after the reconstruction with examination of the healthy controls at 2 different occasions. Group A was composed of 41 patients with a right-sided chronic ACL rupture, and group B was composed of 44 patients with a left-sided chronic ACL rupture. All patients underwent an arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft. Group C was composed of 35 persons without any known knee problems. One experienced physiotherapist performed all the KT-1000 measurements and the clinical examinations. Group A displayed an increased difference in side-to-side laxity between the injured and non-injured side compared with group B in terms of both anterior and total knee laxity. This difference was found to be statistically significant preoperatively (P = .01, anterior; P = .001, total) and at follow-up evaluation 2 years after the index surgery (P = .008, anterior; P = .006, total). In group C, a significant increase was seen in absolute anterior and total laxity in the right knee compared with the left knee when 2 repeated measurements were performed (P < .0001 and P = .003, anterior; P < .0001 and P = .001, total). The KT-1000 arthrometer revealed a significant increase in laxity measurements in right knees compared with left knees. This difference was found both preoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. The same thing was found in a group of persons without any known knee problems.

Patients were excluded if they had medial meniscus tears or chondral lesions. All patients underwent ACL reconstruction using patellar tendon autografts. Sixty-seven lateral menisci underwent repair using an inside-outside technique, while 24 lateral menisci were partially excised. Subjective follow-up evaluation was obtained with a modified Noyes questionnaire. Patients were objectively evaluated according to International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee evaluation criteria.Results: The mean subjective total score for the repair group was 92.5 ± 9.4 (mean time, 7.0 ± 2.6 years postoperatively), and the mean score for the removal group was 88.7 ± 13.2 (mean time 11.1 ± 4.0 years; P = .2014). The mean pain scores were 16.8 ± 3.1 points for the repair group and 14.0 ± 4.0 for the partial excision group, which was statistically significant (P = .0478). The distribution of IKDC overall grades was not statistically significantly different between groups (P = .0947). Two of 67 meniscus repairs failed, requiring subsequent removal.Conclusions: Results showed that patients in the partial meniscectomy group had more pain than in the repair group, but no statistically significant difference was found between groups for overall subjective score or IKDC grade. Further follow-up evaluation is needed before definitive treatment can be recommended.

Methods: All patients were competitive athletes before injury and had undergone ACL reconstruction by the transtibial endoscopic technique with either a bone-patellar tendon-bone or a multiple looped hamstring autograft. Evaluation was carried out a mean of 43 months (range 24-73) after surgery by a postal questionnaire in which the Cincinnati sports activity scale (CSAS) and Cincinnati sports function scales were presented in conjunction with closed questions on change in competitive level and the presence of complaints. Results: Of 109 selected patients, 77 (71%) responded. At follow up, 62 of 77 patients (81%) reported that they had returned to competition within 12 months of surgery. Within the same time frame, 55 of the above 62 patients (89%) also claimed to have returned to the level at which they were competing before injury (or higher). At follow up, 30 of the above 55 patients (54%) reported to still be competing at this high level. Twelve of the above 55 patients (22%) also admitted to major problems with the operated knee at that time. The overall incidence of patients competing despite major functional impairment in the operated knee was 13 of 62 (21%) at 12 months and six of 47 (13%) at follow up. Thirty eight patients (49%) were active in sport at least four times a week at follow up (CSAS level 1), and, using Spearman's rank correlation between CSAS scores and total sports function scores, r was calculated to be 0.44. Competitive and male patients had higher total sports function scores at follow up than non-competitive (p = 0.005) and female (p = 0.02) patients respectively. Conclusions: The reported return to competition at the previous level, both within 12 months and at follow up, was high but as expected considering the standard of treatment, patient selection, and study exclusion criteria. Patients with few functional complaints maintained a high level of sporting activity, even after discontinuing competitive participation.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autograft; bone graft; calculation; cartilage degeneration; competition; controlled study; correlation analysis; endoscopic surgery; evaluation; female; follow up; functional assessment; functional disease; graft failure; hamstring; human; incidence; injury scale; knee injury; knee ligament injury; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; postal mail; questionnaire; sport; tendon graft; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Athletic Injuries; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Time Factors","","","","","","","Noyes, Frank R., Arthroscopy in acute traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee.

Furthermore, the release of these mediators has been considered a possible reason for the higher incidence of bone tunnel enlargement following hamstring tendon (HST) than following patellar tendon (PT) ACL reconstruction observed in several studies. In this investigation synovial fluid samples from 13 patients were collected immediately before (24±7 days after ACL rupture) and 7 days after ACL surgery and values of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, NO, and BMP-2 were analyzed. Furthermore, the incidence of bone tunnel enlargement was assessed using radiographs 38±7 weeks after surgery. Six patients underwent autologous HST ACL reconstruction, and in seven patients an PT autograft was used. In the overall patient population there were significantly higher synovial fluid concentrations of IL-6 and BMP-2 postoperatively than preoperatively; TNF-α showed a trend towards lower postoperative levels while IL-1β and NO remained unchanged. The concentrations of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 found in the present study were clearly higher than normal values given in the literature. Assessment of bone tunnel enlargement revealed an average increase in tibial tunnel width of 28.4±3.1% with comparable values for HST and PT ACL reconstructions. There was no significant correlation between bone tunnel enlargement and postoperative synovial fluid concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, NO, and BMP-2. However, all patients with bone tunnel enlargement had higher postoperative concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and NO in the synovial fluid. There were no significant differences in concentrations between HST and PT groups. In conclusion, we observed an association between tibial bone tunnel enlargement and elevated synovial fluid concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α, and NO 7 days after ACL surgery indicating the potential involvement of these biological mediators in the pathogenesis of bone tunnel enlargement. However, there was no difference between HST and PT ACL reconstructions regarding synovial fluid contents of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, NO, and BMP-2, suggesting a comparable biological response between these autografts following their use in ACL reconstruction. © Springer-Verlag 2003.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bone morphogenic protein 2; Bone tunnel enlargement; Nitric oxide; Proinflammatory cytokines","bone morphogenetic protein 2; cytokine; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; nitric oxide; tumor necrosis factor alpha; BMP2 protein, human; bone morphogenetic protein; transforming growth factor beta; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autograft; bone radiography; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; female; hamstring; human; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; postoperative complication; preoperative evaluation; synovial fluid; arthroscopy; autotransplantation; chemistry; comparative study; immunology; patella; prospective study; radiography; reference value; tendon; tibia; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Male; Nitric Oxide; Patella; Prospective Studies; Reference Values; Synovial Fluid; Tendons; Tibia; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transplantation, Autologous; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","","nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; BMP2 protein, human, 0; bone morphogenetic protein 2, 0; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins, 0; Interleukin-6, 0; Nitric Oxide, 10102-43-9; Transforming Growth Factor beta, 0; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, 0","","","","","Al-Saffar, Najat, Pathology of the bone-implant interfaces, Journal of Long-Term Effects of Medical Implants, 9, 4, pp. 319-347, (1999); Barber, Frank Alan, The effect of outlet fixation on tunnel widening, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 19, 5, pp. 485-492, (2003); Bauer, Thomas W., The pathology of total joint arthroplasty II.

Carrell Memorial Clinic, Dallas, TX, United States","Purpose: Reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) using the tibial inlay fixation has been reported as an alternative to the transtibial tunnel technique. Previous failures in PCL reconstruction and early reports raising potential biomechanical and clinical advantages have spurred interest in this technique. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the minimum 2-year results of PCL reconstruction using a single-bundle bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and tibial inlay fixation. Methods: The authors prospectively studied 44 patients having isolated or combined PCL reconstruction using the direct tibial inlay fixation technique. The study period was from 1991 to 2001. Two-year minimum follow-up was 93% (41/44) and averaged 39.4 months. These 41 patients comprised the study group. Thirty-one patients were male and 10 patients were female; average age was 28 years. There were 35 primary and 6 revision reconstructions. Surgery was performed in the acute or subacute setting (<8 weeks) in 34% (14/41) and chronic setting in 66% (27/41). Combined reconstructions involving the posterolateral corner, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), or medial collateral ligament (MCL) were done in 85% (35/41). In all patients, preoperative posterior drawer (PD) examination demonstrated greater than 12 mm posterior translation. All PCL reconstructions were performed with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, which was 12 to 18 mm in width (16 autograft; 25 allograft). Wider tendon grafts were prepared from the allografts and tubularized to fit through an 11-mm tunnel. All patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative examination and x-rays. Final follow-up International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective evaluation, final follow-up IKDC objective evaluation, and final follow-up Telos stress radiography were performed in all patients. Results: Postoperative PD examination demonstrated the following: 0 (normal) in 9 patients, 1+ in 25 patients, 2+ in 7 patients, and none >2+, as compared to preoperative PD 3+ or greater in all patients in this report. No patient had <12 mm PD preoperatively. Mean improvement in PD was >2 grades of translation as compared to preoperative exam. Forty of forty-one demonstrated a solid endpoint on clinical PD testing. Final follow-up Telos stress radiography with 25 kg posterior load applied at 80° to 90° of flexion demonstrated average side-to-side difference of 4.11 mm (-2 to 10 mm). Average flexion loss was 4° (0-15°). None lost extension. Preoperative IKDC objective evaluation rated all knees as severely abnormal based on instability. Final follow-up objective IKDC evaluation distribution was as follows: A, 4 knees; B, 24 knees; C, 11 knees; and D, 2 knees, as compared to all 41 D preoperatively. Average final follow-up IKDC subjective score was 75.1 (20-100). When assessing final follow-up stability with Telos stress radiography, primary cases were significantly more stable than revision cases (P < .05). There was no difference in stability when comparing allograft versus autograft, but improved IKDC scores were seen with allograft (P < .05). There was a trend for combined reconstructions to be more stable than isolated reconstructions. All patients evaluated their knee as improved or greatly improved and would repeat the procedure. Conclusions: Reconstruction of the PCL-deficient knee with severe posterior laxity is a challenging surgical problem, as combined instability patterns frequently coexist (85% in this study). When appropriate combined reconstructions or primary repair is used, PCL reconstruction with autologous or allograft bone-patellar tendon-bone graft using tibial inlay fixation was shown to be a successful technique at 2- to 10-year follow-up.

Type of Study:A case series of patients who had received arthroscopic ACL reconstructions using quadriceps tendon autograft was retrospectively evaluated. Methods: Sixty-seven ACL reconstructions were evaluated at a mean of 41 months (range, 27 to 49 months). Clinical assessment was made using a modified Lysholm score, documentation of International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the anterior knee pain questionnaire of Shelbourne and Trumper, and by KT-2000 arthrometric analysis. Isokinetic strength testing and radiographic assessments were also performed. Results: Arthrometric analysis showed that 63 knees (94%) were graded A or B with a median laxity of 2 mm postoperatively. The Lysholm score improved postoperatively from 71 to 90 (P ≤ .05). Extension peak torque of the quadriceps muscle recovered to 82% and 89% of that of the contralateral knee at 180°/second at 1 year and 2 years after surgery, respectively. The patellar position in terms of congruence angle and Insall-Salvati ratio did not show any significant change. Only 4 patients complained of moderate pain on kneeling and 1 patient complained of harvest-site tenderness. Conclusions: ACL reconstruction using a quadriceps tendon autograft showed satisfactory results with reduced donor-site morbidities. The quadriceps tendon can be a reliable source of graft, and is comparable to bone-patellar tendon-bone or hamstring tendon in ACL reconstruction.

Fifteen months before this episode, he underwent an ACL reconstruction (autologous patellar tendon graft surgery) plus posterolateral reconstruction with direct suture and fascia lata augmentation. Radiographs revealed correct positioning of tunnels and fixation screws. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the graft rupture was close to the tibial bone block and presented a signal compatible to the optimal graft incorporation. Surgery recording and clinical records were reviewed. No failures were found. After careful evaluation we concluded that the primary cause of failure was trauma. Based on these findings a salvage surgery technique was performed. Return to sport activities was allowed after four months when sufficient strength and range of motion had returned. Recent follow up (2 years 8 months postoperative) has shown an excellent result with a Lysholm score of 100, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score of 100, and a KT-1000 arthrometer reading of between 0 and 5 mm. The athlete has returned to his previous professional level. We believe this simple, specific, nonaggressive, and anatomic reconstructive technique may be used in the case of avulsion or distal detachment caused only by trauma and with a graft that is likely to heal. © 2004 Arthroscopy Association of North America.","ACL autograft salvage; ACL graft rupture; Arthroscopy","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; autotransplantation; case report; human; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee injury; knee radiography; male; medical record; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; rugby; scoring system; sport injury; surgical technique; suturing method; tendon transplantation; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Johnson, Darren L., Revision anterior cruciate ligament surgery: Experience from Pittsburgh, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 325, pp. 100-109, (1996); Athroscopy Association of North America Annual Meeting, (1995); Greis, Patrick E., Revision anterior cruciate ligament surgery: Causes of graft failure and technical considerations of revision surgery, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 12, 4, pp. 839-852, (1993); Crucial Ligaments, (1994); Arciero, Robert A., Endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: complication of graft rupture and a method of salvage., The American journal of knee surgery, 9, 1, pp. 27-31, (1996)","","","W.B.

This association was examined, along with the effect of femoral and tibial tunnel enlargement on the clinical results of ACL reconstruction performed with either bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or hamstring (HST) autografts. Forty-six patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction (23 receiving BPTB autograft and 23 HST) between March 1999 and July 2001. Thirty patients (13 receiving BPTB autograft and 17 HST) completed the last clinical and radiologic evaluations and were included in the study. The mean age of patients in the HST group was 29.8 years (range 18-39) and that in the BPTB group was 27.6 years (range 20-37). The mean follow-up period was 24.6 months (range 12-36) in HST group and 18.5 months (range 12-40) in BPTB group. The effect of tunnel enlargement on the clinical results was evaluated by comparing preoperative and postoperative Lysholm, Tegner, and International Knee Documentation Committee scores and ligament laxity measurements between and within the groups. Postoperative femoral and tibial tunnel diameters in both groups were significantly larger than their corresponding preoperative tunnel diameters. In an intergroup evaluation, the enlargement of the tibial tunnel was similar in both groups (P=.556), but the femoral tunnel diameter was significantly larger in the HST group than in the BPTB group (P>.001). Preoperative laxity of the knees significantly improved after the operations in both groups, but no difference between the groups was evident at the final follow-up visit. No correlation between tunnel widening and the clinical results of the BPTB and HST procedures was observed.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone tunnel enlargement; Knee; Patellar tendon, hamstring tendons, autograft; Reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; autograft; bone graft; clinical article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; female; follow up; hamstring; human; joint laxity; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; preoperative evaluation","","","","","","","L'Insalata, John C., Tunnel expansion following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A comparison of hamstring and patellar tendon autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 4, pp. 234-238, (1997); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); Webster, Kate E., Bone tunnel enlargement following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A randomised comparison of hamstring and patellar tendon grafts with 2-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 9, 2, pp. 86-91, (2001); Hogervorst, Tom, Abnormal bone scans of the tibial tunnel 2 years after patella ligament anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Correlation with tunnel enlargement and tibial graft length, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 8, 6, pp. 322-328, (2000); Nebelung, Wolfgang, Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with semitendinosus tendon using endobutton fixation on the femoral side, Arthroscopy, 14, 8, pp. 810-815, (1998); Jansson, Kim A., Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the hamstring autograft and endobutton fixation technique: A clinical, radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging study with 2 years follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 5, pp. 290-295, (1999); Simonian, Peter T., Tunnel expansion after hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with 1-incision EndoButton femoral fixation, Arthroscopy, 16, 7, pp. 707-714, (2000); Segawa, Hiroyuki, Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendons, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 9, 4, pp. 206-210, (2001); Buelow, Jens Ulrich, A prospective evaluation of tunnel enlargement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstrings: Extracortical versus anatomical fixation, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 10, 2, pp. 80-85, (2002); Fink, Christian, Tibial tunnel enlargement following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft, Arthroscopy, 17, 2, pp. 138-143, (2001)","","","Springer Healthcare kathleen.burke@springer.com","","","","","","0741238X","","ADTHE","","English","Adv.

Specific diagnosis in knee pain is difficult, most service patients are grouped together as ""Patello-Femoral Stress Syndrome"". Knee pain incidence within the service population is unknown, but thought to be greater than those presenting to General Practitioners. 293 active duty service men (100 Army and 193 Royal Navy) were interviewed and examined in relation to their knees. 138 measurements were made on each subject. 118 admitted to knee problems. Six had specific diagnoses, ranging from patellar tendonitis to ACL deficiency (with marked anterior instability). The remaining 112 individuals formed the study group and examination findings were compared with the 175 without Patello-Femoral Stress Syndrome. The results have been analysed to determine normal ranges and predictors of knee pain. Age, years in the military and results of patello-femoral compression tests were consistently significantly different between the groups. This survey provides useful information on normal values at examination. Q angle measurement was a poor predictor of knee pain. There was no clinically detectable anatomical variant that correlated with the Patello-Femoral Stress Syndrome. There was poor correlation between Tegner activity score and the perceived limitation on sport or work, as assessed on a visual analogue scale.","","arthralgia; article; human; knee; knee injury; male; medicine; pathology; sport injury; Arthralgia; Athletic Injuries; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Naval Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00359033","","","15745258","English","J R Nav Med Serv","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-19644385720"

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery has seen significant progress since bioabsorbable interference screws have replaced synthetic metallic screws for ligament graft fixation within the femoral and tibial osseous tunnel. Our study compared the MR images of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using bioabsorbable interference screws with those of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using metallic screws to evaluate the MR aspects of degradation and osteointegration processes of bioabsorbable interference screws post-operatively. Materials and methods. Between September 1999 and December 2002 we performed MRI on 40 patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon auto-graft using PDLLA bioabsorbable screws in 35 cases and metallic screws in 5 cases. After surgery, all patients underwent an intensive rehabilitation programme along with clinical evaluation using the standard knee ligament evaluation form of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and radiological examinations. MR studies were performed 1, 2 and 3 years post-operatively using a 0.5-Tesla MR scanner with T1- and T2*-weighted and STIR sequences. Results. Thirty-three patients were clinically classified as group A IKDC (full return to sports activity) and 7 patients as group B IKDC. No foreign-body reaction was found in patients treated with bioabsorbable interference screws, both from a clinical point of view and from laboratory exams. Ferromagnetic artefacts were found in all patients treated with metallic interference screws. In patients with bioabsorbable interference screws, degradation of the screws and absence of significant artefacts allowed correct evaluation of the signal of the reconstructed ligament throughout its length, the osseous tunnels and the joint cavity. In 34 of 35 patients with bioabsorbable interference screws, the screw could not be detected due to complete degradation. In 8, 12 and 4 cases, a small cyst-like formation due to screw hydrolysis was present at the screw site within 1, 2 and 3 years from surgery respectively. Only in 4 cases was the process of osteointegration of the screw and bone plug complete 3 years after the operation, with consequent restoration of bone morphology. Discussion and conclusions. The use of bioabsorbable interference screws is a valuable alternative to synthetic metallic fixation implants as the absence of artefacts allows correct post-operative MR follow-up. MRI is the only technique able to visualize all the portions of the transplant and to evaluate the healing process. Bioabsorbable interference screws usually degrade within one year. However, full osteointegration requires a long time and may not be complete 3 years after surgery. The presence of cyst-like formations at the screw site has to be regarded as a normal feature of the screw degradation process. Therefore, the use of bioabsorbable interference screws is recommended as it enables MR follow-up of the knee after ACL reconstruction.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bioabsorbable interference screws; Knee; MR","polylactic acid; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; artifact reduction; biodegradable implant; bone screw; clinical article; female; femur; foreign body reaction; human; knee arthroplasty; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; tibia; Absorbable Implants; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bone Screws; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Metals; Osseointegration; Tendons; Time Factors; Transplantation, Autologous","","polylactic acid, 26100-51-6; Metals, 0","Syborb, Synos","Synos","","","Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Engebretsen, Lars, A prospective, randomized study of three surgical techniques for treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 6, pp. 585-590, (1990); Schaefer, Craig J., Absorbable ligating clips, Surgery Gynecology and Obstetrics, 154, 4, pp. 513-516, (1982); Hollinger, Jeffrey O., Biodegradable bone repair materials.

Henze, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States","Purpose: Despite the high long-term success rates of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions, 8% of patients undergoing this primary procedure have recurrent disability and graft failure. Nonanatomic tunnel positioning (primarily of the femoral tunnel) accounts for most of all technical failures. We hypothesized that reconstructions that closely recreate the oblique femoral attachment of the ACL would result in more normal knee rotational stability than more vertical reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether obliquity of the femoral tunnel in the coronal (frontal) plane has an effect on rotational constraint after ACL reconstruction, as measured by anterior tibial translation, external rotation, and internal rotation. Type of Study: Ex vivo biomechanical study. Methods: Ten matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaver knees were alternately assigned to a standard or an oblique tunnel position reconstruction. Each knee was tested at 30° and 90° of flexion on a materials testing machine in ACL-intact, ACL-sectioned, and ACL-reconstructed states. A 100-N load was applied at a rate of 10 N/second, and anterior tibial translation was measured. Then 6.5 Nm of torque were applied, and external tibial rotation and internal tibial rotation were measured. The effects of tunnel placement and ligament condition were analyzed with a repeated measures analysis of variance. Significance was set at P≤.05 (Tukey's test). Results: At 30° of flexion, internal tibial rotation in oblique reconstruction was restored to intact values and was significantly less than the internal tibial rotation values in standard reconstruction. Internal tibial rotation in standard reconstruction was significantly greater than intact values. No significant differences were found between standard and oblique tunnel reconstructions and the respective intact values for the remaining internal tibial rotation and all external tibial rotation tests, regardless of flexion angle. Conclusions: In our biomechanical model, ACL reconstructions using oblique femoral tunnels restored normal knee kinematics.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Knee; Reconstruction; Rotational stability; Tunnel placement","adult; aged; analysis of variance; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autograft; biomechanics; cadaver; clinical article; female; graft failure; human; kinematics; knee arthroplasty; long term care; male; nonanatomic tunnel positioning; patella tendon; recurrent disease; rotation; standard; statistical significance; surgical technique; tendon graft; tibia","","","","","","","Girgis, F.

The Telos was used as the reference technique. Material and methods Criteria for inclusion were preoperative anterior knee laxity, normal contralateral knee, and intra-articular surgery to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament. Between January 1st, 2000 and October 31st, 2001, 147 patients were operated on for knee instability using an autograft (BPTB or hamstring tendons). For each patient, comparative measurements were made for both knees preoperatively and postoperatively with an average follow-up of 16 months. Measurements with the KT-1000 apparatus were made with forces of 67 N, 89 N, 134 N and manual maximal force. For the Telos, a force of 250 N was used as recommended by the manufacturer. We also evaluated intraobserver variation between the two devices. Results The anterior translation preoperatively as measured by the KT-1000 at 89N was 4.2 ±2.4 mm and 6.3 ± 2.5 mm at maximal manual force. The result for Telos was 3.0 ± 3.6 mm. The data scatter obtained with Telos was wider than with KT-1000 (p < 0.03). The sensitivity of Telos was 72% with 28% false negatives. With KT-1000, sensitivity increased as tensile force increased. Sensitivity was 65% at 89N, 73% at 134N and 92% at maximal manual force. The concordance between the KT-1000 and Telos data was low for either preoperative (10%) or postoperative (30%) measurements. Discussion and conclusion In this study, the results of sensitivity and reproducibility as well as the minimal scatter of the values demonstrated the reliability of KT-1000 for measuring anterior translation of the knee. We recommend routine use of the KT-1000 device for measuring knee laxity. The low sensitivity and the high rate of false negative observed with Telos raises the question of its use a reference technique.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Arthrometer; Knee; Laximeter","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthrometer; article; controlled study; device; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; female; force; human; intermethod comparison; joint laxity; knee instability; knee surgery; major clinical study; male; measurement; observer variation; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; reference value; reproducibility","","","KT-1000, Medmetric; Telos","Medmetric","","","Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior knee laxity in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament disruption, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 6, pp. 401-407, (1985); Sport Med, (1986); Rangger, Christoph, Diagnosis of an ACL disruption with KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, Knee Surgery Sports Traumatology Arthroscopy, 1, 1, pp. 60-66, (1993); Stäubli, Hans Ulrich, Stressradiography of the knee: Cruciate ligament function studied in 138 patients, Acta Orthopaedica, 63, S249, pp. 2-27, (1992); Stäubli, Hans Ulrich, Anterior knee motion analysis.

Hypothesis: The patellar tendon at the donor site would look normal as seen on MRI 6 years after harvesting its central third. Methods: Nineteen consecutive patients were included in the study. MRI examinations of the donor site were performed at 6 (5 to 10) weeks, 6 (6 to 8) months, 27 (24 to 29) months, and 71 (68 to 73) months postoperatively. The contralateral normal side was examined only on the first occasion. Results: The size of the donor-site gap decreased significantly (P = 0.0001) between 6 weeks and 6 years. In most patients, a thinning of the central part of the patellar tendon was still found at 6 years. The thickness of the peripheral patellar tendon was increased, compared with the contralateral healthy side, until 2 years (P = 0.003). On all occasions, the width was increased compared with the contralateral side (P < 0.015). Conclusion: Prospective MRI examinations revealed that the patellar tendon at the donor site had not normalized 6 years after harvesting its central third.

It has not been established, however, whether either of these techniques provides a greater functional advantage to the patient. Purpose: To identify patients' functional capabilities after reconstruction of the ACL with a patellar or semitendinosus tendon autograft. Methods: Forty male soccer players volunteered for the study and were assigned to three homogeneous groups: individuals who had patellar tendon reconstruction (N = 15), individuals who had semitendinosus tendon reconstruction (N = 15), and a control group (N = 10). All patients had undergone surgery 2 yr before this study and received the same rehabilitation training. The testing procedures included measurement of thigh circumference, maximal isometric strength of quadriceps and hamstrings, two- and one-legged jump, squat and gait analysis. Kinetic, kinematic, and electromyographic data were collected. Results: The patellar tendon group exhibited lower (P < 0.05) coactivation of the agonist and antagonist muscles around the knee joint during the squat movement and lower stabilization- and landing degrees during the jumps. Furthermore, the patellar tendon group had a shorter stance phase and reached the first vertical maximum later with the impaired leg while walking (720.2 ± 15.6 ms vs 740.3 ± 14.3 ms, and 24.3 ± 0.64% vs 22.9 ± 0.74% of stance phase), which was not observed in the semitendinosus tendon and control groups. Conclusion: Functional performance is compromised in patients who undergo a patellar tendon graft compared with a semitendinosus graft, possibly due to an altered activation of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles.","EMG; GAIT analysis; Knee stability; Neuromuscular control; SQUAT","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; controlled study; electromyography; functional assessment; gait; hamstring; human; jumping; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; ligament surgery; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; quadriceps femoris muscle; semitendinous muscle; sport injury; standing; tendon graft; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Electromyography; Exercise; Gait; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Patellar Ligament; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Baker, Daniel G., Generality versus specificity: a comparison of dynamic and isometric measures of strength and speed-strength, European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology, 68, 4, pp. 350-355, (1994); Boden, Barry P., Mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injury, Orthopedics, 23, 6, pp. 573-578, (2000); Carter, Thomas R., Isokinetic evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Hamstring versus patellar tendon, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 15, 2, pp. 169-172, (1999); Chappell, Jonathan D., A comparison of knee kinetics between male and female recreational athletes in stop-jump tasks, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 2, pp. 261-267, (2002); Corrigan, J.

Disruption of the anterior cruciate ligament is a common injury, often resulting in functional instability. Currently, arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the central third bone-patellar tendon-bone graft is a common surgical procedure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the postoperative structural remodeling in the ligament following ACL reconstruction over time by X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods. We performed arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with central third bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft for 27 patients (14 males, 13 females, mean 27.2 years old) between October 1995 and January 1999. All patients were examined post-operatively at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months by X-ray to evaluate the sequential change of the tibia bone tunnel and by MRI to monitor the sequential signal changes in the recipient and donor sites. Results. The MRI showed an increased signal at the patellar tendon (donor site) at 3 and 6 months and decreased signal after 1 year. The signal of ACL graft from MRI remained increased after operation. On AP, lateral view of X-ray, the diameter at the joint site of the tunnel was larger than at the bone plug site. Pearson correlation method revealed that the diameter of the bone tunnel expanding at the joint site was statistically greater than that at the bone plug site (p < 0.05). The difference between the bone tunnel diameter at the bone plug site and the joint site was not statistically correlated with the distance between them (by linear regression method, p = 0. 77). Conclusions. We concluded that the windshield wiper effect could not be the only factor inducing the enlargement of the bone tunnel, based on our results. The signal change of patellar tendon was more obvious than that of the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Magnetic resonance imaging; Patellar tendon","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone graft; clinical article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; donor site; female; human; knee radiography; ligament surgery; linear regression analysis; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; patient monitoring; postoperative period; recipient; statistical analysis; surgical approach; tibia; adolescent; middle aged; patella; pathology; postoperative complication; radiography; tendon; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Postoperative Complications; Tendons","","","","","","","Fahey, Mark, Bone Tunnel Enlargement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 410-414, (1994); Jackson, Douglas W., Intraarticular reaction associated with the use of freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized bone-patella tendon-bone allografts in the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 1, pp. 1-11, (1990); Roberts, Thomas S., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized, bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts: Two year results in thirty-six patients, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 1, pp. 35-41, (1991); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); L'Insalata, John C., Tunnel expansion following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A comparison of hamstring and patellar tendon autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 4, pp. 234-238, (1997); Hoeher, Jürgen, Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Fact or fiction?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 4, pp. 231-240, (1998); Trattnig, Siegfried, Magnetic resonance imaging of the postoperative knee, Topics in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 10, 4, pp. 221-236, (1999); Jansson, Kim A., Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the hamstring autograft and endobutton fixation technique: A clinical, radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging study with 2 years follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 5, pp. 290-295, (1999); Fu, Freddie H., Current trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Material and methods: A retrospective comparison of 34 patients operated with a fascia lata graft and 26 patients operated with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. The patients were evaluated twice with a postoperative Lysholm score, a preoperative and postoperative Tegner score, and a postoperative knee-laxity test. Results: The Lysholm scores after the first (P = 0.07) and second (P = 0.29) postoperative control showed no difference between the two groups. There was no difference between the preoperative and postoperative Tegner scores of the two groups (P = 0.42). A total of 27 patients out of 60 practised sports or had knee-straining work postoperatively at the same level as preoperatively. No difference was found between the two groups when comparing the knee-laxity tests (P = 0.12). Discussion: This study did not find any difference in the final functional results when comparing the two operation techniques. Almost half of the patients can expect a return to sports at a preinjury level.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; fascia lata; female; human; joint laxity; knee function; ligament surgery; male; patella; postoperative period; preoperative period; retrospective study; scoring system; sport; surgical technique; tendon graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Transplantation; Fascia Lata; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Patient Satisfaction; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Groves, Ernest W.Hey, The crucial ligaments of the knee‐joint: Their function, rupture, and the operative treatment of the same, British Journal of Surgery, 7, 28, pp. 505-515, (1919); Surg Gynecol Obstet, (1936); Jones, K.

Whether reconstruction is indicated and which technique should be employed is still controversially debated. The surgical results obtained between 1982 and 1992 at the State Orthopedic Hospital Munich for 101 ACL ruptures diagnosed arthroscopically in patients with open physes were evaluated retrospectively. In 69% of cases the main finding of knee joint arthroscopy was the presence of hemarthrosis. In 84% the cause was a sports-related injury, particularly alpine skiing. 15% of the ACL injuries could only be confirmed/diagnosed by arthroscopy. Incorrect clinical diagnoses were found in up to 50% of cases, especially in the assessment of concomitant injuries.In 17 cases only diagnostic arthroscopy (mean age at surgery 12.3 years) was performed. Ten osseous refixations for fracture of intercondylar eminence (12.0 years) and 24 primary suture managements (14.2 years) were performed. In 36 cases, pedicled semitendinosus tendon augmentation was performed in addition to reinsertion (14.9 years). In 14 cases primary plastic repair was performed with the middle one-third of the patellar tendon (15.4 years).Fifty-four patients could be followed up for a mean 6.5 years after the operation by means of Lysholm, Tegner and IKDC scores. The clinical stability examination was supplemented by KT-1000 arthrometer measurement and radiography in two planes. Averaged for all surgical techniques, good and very good results were obtained in over 75% of cases. There were no major growth defects and rarely arthrotic changes. Suture management alone is not infrequently followed by re-ruptures; augmentations or plastic repair are thus the preferred procedures for patients aged 12 years or more. In patients with still wide open physes, the semitendinosus tendon should be preferred due to the possibility of obtaining and anchoring grafts.This study emphatically demonstrates in a large number of ACL stabilizations with open physes that very good stabilization is achieved but no growth defects are to be expected despite transepiphyseal drilling. © , Springer-Verlag.","Arthroscopy; Cruciate ligament tears; Fracture of the intercondylar eminence; Hemarthrosis; Ligament injuries in children and adolescents; Ligament surgery; Open physes","","","","","","","","Osterreich, (1994); Anderson, A.

Seven patients were treated with a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft for the ACL reconstruction and an Achilles allograft for the PCL reconstruction, three patients with ipsilateral/contralateral BPTB autografts, and one patient with BPTB allograft for ACL and Achilles allograft for PCL. Seven patients were operated on acutely (<3 months postinjury), and 4 were treated for chronic conditions. At follow-up, all patients were subjectively and functionally evaluated with a Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. Average patient age at surgery was 29 years, and average postoperative follow-up was 28.4 months. Average postoperative Lysholm score was 87.7 (range: 49-100). Four of 11 patients reported occasional mild pain, 2 occasional swelling, and 4 infrequent instability. No patient required a postoperative manipulation to regain his or her range of motion and 10 of the 11 returned to their previous activity level postoperatively. Of the 10 patients able to return for clinical examination, 2 demonstrated a loss of flexion <5 degrees compared to the other side, 7 demonstrated a mild postoperative posterior drawer at 90 degrees (6 at 1+, 1 at 2+), 3 demonstrated a positive Lachman (grade 1), whereas no patient demonstrated any posterior lateral corner instability. The average anterior active difference on KT-1000 was 2.6 (range: 0-6). Simultaneous reconstruction of the ACL and PCL, although technically difficult, is feasible and yields good to excellent functional results.","","anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; human; injury; knee injury; knee ligament; methodology; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Humans; Knee Injuries; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15388506","","","14584830","English","J Knee Surg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1542780749"

In ten uninjured knees with known hyperextension, the knees were bandaged in the same way as after an ACL-reconstruction. The knees were then studied radiologically in a Hypex brace set at 0°, -5° and -10° of knee extension. Not a single knee was found to be straight in the brace set at 0°. At -5° most of the knees were straight or in slight hyperextension. It took -10° to get all knees straight or in hyperextension. In a prospective randomised study 44 patients who underwent an arthroscopic ACL-reconstruction with a bone patellar tendon bone graft were randomised to use either a brace set at -5° or a straight brace (0°) for at least the first three postoperative weeks. Before and three months after surgery range of motion was determined, using a goniometer with long arms, and sagittal knee laxity was measured with a KT-2000 arthrometer at manual max. Pre- and post-operative pain was evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The same examiner (blindfolded to what type of brace was used) performed all the measurements. At three months, two of the 22 patients with the brace set at -5° and twelve of the 22 patients with the straight brace had a loss of full extension of 2° or more (p<0.001). No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of knee flexion, sagittal knee laxity or post-operative pain. Although extension deficit after ACL-reconstruction can be prevented also in other ways, a Hypex brace set at -5° seems to be an easy way of ensuring full knee extension.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Anterior knee laxity; Extension deficit; Hyperextension brace; Range of motion","adolescent; adult; analytic method; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; bandage; bone graft; brace; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; goniometry; human; joint function; ligament surgery; male; measurement; pain; pain assessment; patella tendon; postoperative care; postoperative pain; preoperative period; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; surgical patient; tendon graft; visual analog scale","","","Hypex, firma albrecht","firma albrecht","","","Cosgarea, Andrew John, Prevention of Arthrofibrosis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Central Third Patellar Tendon Autograft, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 87-92, (1995); Dandy, David J., Problems in regaining full extension of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does arthrofibrosis exist?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 2, 2, pp. 76-79, (1994); Editorial, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 3, (1995); Feller, Julian A., Use of an extension-assisting brace following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 1, pp. 6-9, (1997); Fisher, S.

Their anterior cruciate were reconstructed by applying the mid-one third autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone strip in -press fit technique under arthroscopy. The result was positive in 13 cases in anterior drawer test, in 4 cases in pivot shift test and in 7 cases in Lachman's test preoperatively. RESULTS: The follow-up period was 5-25 months averaged 15 months. The results of the above tests were negative in all the patients. According to Boszotta's evaluation quota, the results were excellent in 9 cases, good in 3 cases and fair in 1 case. The knee stability improved obviously in all patients. CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament injury can be treated by arthroscopic reconstruction with autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone strip and the clinical result of short-term followup is satisfactory.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; female; human; injury; joint instability; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; patella; plastic surgery; tendon; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Surgical Flaps; Tendons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10021892","","","12916300","Chinese","Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0642377666"

Some authors have shown in vitro that the viscoelastic nature of the patellar tendon is responsible for its gradual release (loss of tension). It is the purpose of this study to verify in vivo the biomechanical behavior of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. A total of 40 consecutive patients were submitted to reconstruction of the ACL with flexor tendons of the knee using a method that allows for the gradual tensioning of the doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendons using the Swing Bridge method. Patients were divided into 2 groups: in the first 20 patients (group I), after adequate manual pretensioning and tibial and femoral stabilization, the tendons were twisted using a dynamometer to measure torsion forces until tensioning equal to 2.5 N was achieved. The control group (group II) was made up of the successive 20 patients in whom tensioning of the tendons at 2.5 N was carried out in many phases. Five minutes after initial tensioning at 2.5 N the decrease in tension was recorded that returned to initial values. A similar procedure was carried out after 5 more minutes. The patients in both groups were evaluated using a KT-1000 arthrometer one year after surgery. The patients in group II showed a decrease in torsion equal to 37.2% after the first 5 minutes, and a further 26.8% after 5 more minutes, and measurement by means of KT-1000 revealed mean values for S/S 30 lb. and S/S MM of 1.3 mm and 1.7 mm, respectively, that proved to have a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) as compared to the patients in group I (S/S 30 lb.: 2.0 mm; S/S MM: 2.4 mm). Although these data do not provide indications on the amount and duration of pretensioning and definitive tensioning to be applied to the transplant, they do clearly show the viscoelastic properties of the tendons. These properties require a more in-depth study to better determine the exact tensioning of the neoligament.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; comparative study; elasticity; evaluation; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee; knee meniscus; male; pathophysiology; physiology; rotation; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; viscosity; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Elasticity; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Range of Motion, Articular; Rotation; Tendons; Treatment Outcome; Viscosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00094749","","","14584319","English","Chir Organi Mov","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0642373936"

The results show that placement the femoral tunnel anteriorly to the line which was perpendicular to the Blumensaat line where it starts to curve posteriorly and tibial tunnel angle of 75 degrees or more is associated with statistically significant worsened of clinical outcome. Malalignment of femoral tunnel placement characterised much larger effects of qualitative and quantitative changes.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; chi square distribution; female; human; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; patella; pathology; plastic surgery; tendon; tibia; time; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons; Tibia; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0009479X","","","12884656","Polish","Chir Narzadow Ruchu Ortop Pol","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0141707638"

The aim of the study was to see if the addition of this device, with its specific potential complications (infection, synovitis, mechanical failure) and increased costs, gave better functional stability and less donor site morbidity. Methods: Forty patients (n=20+20) with high physical demands, anterior cruciate ligament rupture less than 3 weeks old, and positive Lachman and pivot shift tests were included in the study. They were randomised by instructions in a sealed envelope that was randomly chosen. Postoperatively, they were immobilised in a plaster of Paris cast for 2 weeks. Full weight-bearing was not allowed until 6 weeks after the operation. Strength training on the operated side started when movement was restored to nearly normal, usually after 8-10 weeks. Return to full sport activity was allowed 1 year after the operation. Clinical and arthrometric follow-up was performed yearly using the Lysholm functional score, Tegner activity score, KT-1000 testing, Lachman and pivot shift tests. Follow-up lasted 3-9 years (mean 7 years). Results and conclusions: At last follow-up we found no statistical difference in stability tests, functional or activity scores; both groups showed stable improvement concerning scores and arthrometry compared with the preoperative values. No advantages were associated with the use of the Kennedy LAD, and we do not recommend it or a similar device for uncomplicated cases. New augmentation devices are simply launched onto the market, and we recommend caution and thorough evaluation in prospective, randomised studies before they are adopted into use.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Knee injuries; Patellar ligament","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; intermethod comparison; joint stability; knee function; ligament surgery; male; muscle strength; muscle training; patella ligament; patella tendon; plaster cast; postoperative infection; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; sport; surgical technique; tendon graft; tenosynovitis; treatment outcome; weight bearing","","","","","","","Casteleyn, Pierre Paul, Management of anterior cruciate ligament lesions: Surgical fashion, personal whim or scientific evidence?

The hypothesis of this study was that the outlet fixation achieved by the flipped BPTB technique results in diminished tunnel widening at the site of the bone plug. Type of Study: Nonrandomized control trial. Methods: The postoperative radiographs of 67 BPTB anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions were retrospectively reviewed; 31 had conventional BPTBs and 36 had the bone plugs flipped at the tibial end to achieve interference screw fixation of the bone plug at the tibial outlet as well as the femoral outlet. Biodegradable interference screws (PLLA) were used in all cases, which facilitated tunnel measurements. One week after surgery, the maximal tibial bone tunnel widths were measured on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs 1 cm below the tibial plateau. These initial postoperative measurements were compared with measurement from radiographs taken annually thereafter. Clinical information including Lysholm, Tegner, IKDC activity, Lachman, pivot-shift, and range of motion data was also obtained and compared for the 2 groups. Results: In the conventional BPTB group, at an average follow-up of 28 months, 28 of 31 (90%) showed at least a 2-mm increase (20%) in the tibial tunnel width. The mean maximum tunnel width increase was 2.2 mm. In the flipped BPTB group, at an average follow-up of 31 months, none of these 36 showed any increase in tunnel size. In fact, 15 patients had no distinct tibial tunnel remaining and, of the other 21, the average remaining tunnel width was 3 mm. The clinical results evaluating the Tegner, Lysholm, IKDC activity levels, KT, and physical examination parameters showed no significant differences between these 2 groups. The tunnel width decreased during the first year, but remained unchanged after 12 months. No tunnel dilation was observed with bone plug outlet fixation while 90% of the conventional group had at least a 20% increase (P < .001). Conclusions: Outlet fixation with the flipped BPTB technique decreased the tibial tunnel width 1 cm below the plateau while 90% of the conventional BPTB patients demonstrated an average widening of 20%.","ACL reconstruction; Flip technique; Outlet fixation; Tunnel widening","anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone allograft; bone screw; clinical article; controlled study; evaluation; external fixator; female; femur malformation; femur tunnel widening; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee radiography; male; medical examination; medical information; patella tendon; postoperative period","","","","","","","Jansson, Kim A., Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the hamstring autograft and endobutton fixation technique: A clinical, radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging study with 2 years follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 7, 5, pp. 290-295, (1999); Nebelung, Wolfgang, Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with semitendinosus tendon using endobutton fixation on the femoral side, Arthroscopy, 14, 8, pp. 810-815, (1998); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); Fahey, Mark, Bone Tunnel Enlargement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 410-414, (1994); Zijl, Jacco A.C., Comparison of tibial tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft or allograft, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 4, pp. 547-551, (2000); Ishibashi, Yasuyuki, The effect of anterior cruciate ligament graft fixation site at the tibia on knee stability: Evaluation using a robotic testing system, Arthroscopy, 13, 2, pp. 177-182, (1997); Lajtai, Georg, Serial magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of operative site after fixation of patellar tendon graft with bioabsorbable interference screws in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 15, 7, pp. 709-718, (1999); Morgan, Craig D., Isometry testing for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction revisited, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 6, pp. 647-659, (1995); Barber, Frank Alan, Flipped patellar tendon autograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 16, 5, pp. 483-490, (2000); Torg, Joseph S., Clinical I diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament instability in the athlete, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 4, 2, pp. 84-93, (1976)","","","W.B.

The present study compared patient-reported outcomes between the sexes after a minimum of 2 years following arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. Patients were also categorized as acute or chronic based on the time from injury to surgery. Outcome questionnaires were mailed to 638 patients, resulting in 151 eligible respondents included in the analysis. The outcome instruments used were the Cincinnati scale, the ACL-Quality of Life scale, and the Tegner activity rating scale. At an average of 5 years following ACL reconstruction no differences were found between males (n=74) and females (n=77) on the ACL-QOL scale. Females perceived a significantly higher activity level prior to surgery according to the Tegner scale. However, no other differences were identified by gender or stage based on prior, highest, or current Tegner activity levels. Results of the Cincinnati scale for the entire sample showed that females scored an average of 5.7 points lower than males. Analysis of this difference by patient age indicates a trend toward lower scores in females between 12-18 and over 24 years old. Chronicity was not a factor that affected outcome in either males or females. No differences were found in the number of patients who complained of anterior knee pain. We conclude that autogenous bone-patella tendon-bone ACL reconstruction is equally successful in well-matched populations of males and females.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Gender; Outcomes","adult; age; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; chronicity; controlled study; female; follow up; human; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; knee injury; knee pain; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; quality of life; questionnaire; scoring system; sex difference; treatment outcome; adolescent; arthroscopy; comparative study; convalescence; injury; orthopedic surgery; plastic surgery; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Quality of Life; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Sex Factors; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Arendt, Elizabeth Anne, Knee Injury Patterns Among Men and Women in Collegiate Basketball and Soccer: NCAA Data and Review of Literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 694-701, (1995); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Barber-Westin, Sue D., A rigorous comparison between the sexes of results and complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 4, pp. 514-526, (1997); Buss, Daniel D., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with use of autogenous patellar-ligament grafts.

Hypothesis: Anatomic fixation of the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft will reduce tunnel enlargement and improve clinical results. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Sixty patients were randomly divided into three groups: a nonanatomic fixation group (traditional single-incision reconstruction), an anatomic fixation group (reconstruction in which a bone plug was grafted into the tibial tunnel), and an anatomic fixation group with all-inside reconstruction. Stability of the knee joint was examined with a KT-1000 arthrometer at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. At 12 months, anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were made to assess tunnel enlargement. Results: Although the magnitude of tibial displacement gradually increased after reconstruction in all three groups, the anatomic fixation group had significantly better stability than the groups undergoing nonanatomic fixation or all-inside anatomic fixation at 4 and 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. However, there was no significant difference between the three groups at 24 months. Regarding the tibial tunnel, residual rates and enlargement of tunnels were different between the reconstruction techniques. The nonanatomic reconstruction group had significantly greater tunnel enlargement. Conclusion: Anatomic fixation of the graft decreased the tunnel enlargement but had no effect on knee stability at 2-year follow-up. © 2003 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; cohort analysis; female; fracture external fixation; human; intermethod comparison; knee instability; knee radiography; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; medical examination; orthopedic equipment; osteosynthesis; patella tendon; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; randomization; surgical anatomy; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Anatomic versus non-anatomic tibial fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, SUPPL. 1, pp. S43-S48, (1998); Butler, D.

Type of Study: Biomechanical experiment using human cadaveric specimens. Methods: Ten human cadaveric knees (age, 41±13 years) were reconstructed by placing a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft at the 10 and 11 o'clock positions, in a randomized order, and then tested using a robotic/universal force-moment sensor testing system. Two external loading conditions were applied: (1) 134 N anterior tibial load with the knee at full extension, 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion, and (2) a combined rotatory load of 10 N-m valgus and 5 N-m internal tibial torque with the knee at 15° and 30° of flexion. The resulting kinematics of the reconstructed knee and in situ forces in the ACL graft were determined for each femoral tunnel position. Results: In response to a 134-N anterior tibial load, anterior tibial translation (ATT) for both femoral tunnel positions was not significantly different from the intact knee except at 90° of knee flexion as well as at 60° of knee flexion for the 10 o'clock position. There was no significant difference in the ATT between the 10 and 11 o'clock positions, except at 90° of knee flexion. Under a combined rotatory load, however, the coupled ATT for the 11 o'clock position was approximately 130% of that for the intact knee at 15° and 30° of flexion. For the 10 o'clock position, the coupled ATT was not significantly different from the intact knee at 15° of flexion and approximately 120% of that for the intact knee at 30° of flexion. Coupled ATT for the 10 o'clock position was significantly smaller than for the 11 o'clock position at 15° and 30° of flexion. The in situ force in the ACL graft was also significantly higher for the 10 o'clock position than the 11 o'clock position at 30° of flexion in response to the same loading condition (70 ± 18 N v 60 ± 15 N, respectively). Conclusions: The 10 o'clock position more effectively resists rotatory loads when compared with the 11 o'clock position as evidenced by smaller ATT and higher in situ force in the graft. Despite the fact that ACL grafts placed at the 10 or 11 o'clock positions are equally effective under an anterior tibial load, neither femoral tunnel position was able to fully restore knee stability to the level of the intact knee.","Anterior cruciate ligament; In situ force; Knee kinematics; Reconstruction; Tunnel placement","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; bone graft; clinical article; controlled study; force; functional assessment; human; human tissue; kinematics; knee function; knee instability; ligament surgery; patella; rotation; surgical technique; tendon graft; tibia; torque","","","","","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R56AR039683); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS","","Clark, John M., The interrelation of fiber bundles in the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 8, 2, pp. 180-188, (1990); Furman, W., The anterior cruciate ligament: a functional analysis based on postmortem studies, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 58, 2, pp. 179-185, (1976); Fuss, Franz Konstantin, Anatomy of the cruciate ligaments and their function in extension and flexion of the human knee joint, American Journal of Anatomy, 184, 2, pp. 165-176, (1989); Girgis, F.

Type of Study: Case control study. Methods: Sagittal MRIs from 30 patients with a reconstructed ACL graft and from 30 individuals with an intact ACL were reviewed. Reconstructed patients were operated on with a 2-incision technique using a patellar tendon autograft. These selected patients had a normal or nearly normal IKDC score with a 3 mm or less anterior posterior translation on KT-1000 arthrometer testing compared with the intact knee. MRI showed a continuous and homogeneous graft without evidence of roof impingement. Obliquity of the grafted ACL was determined on each lateral MRI by measuring the intersection of the graft line with the tibial plateau plane. These figures were compared with data similarly obtained from 30 individuals with a stable knee and an intact ACL determined by history and physical examination. Results: Graft obliquity in reconstructed patients averaged 67° with a range between 55° and 81°. In normal controls, intact ACL obliquity averaged 51° with a range between 45° and 55°. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < .0001). Conclusions: MRIs of patients with an appropriate tibial tunnel placement in order to avoid notch impingement showed a continuous and homogeneous graft similar to the native ACL, but with a more vertical graft that does not recreate the normal sagittal obliquity. However, according to arthrometer testing, these more vertical grafts can control anterior posterior knee displacement.","ACL reconstruction; Functional anatomy; MRI evaluation; Sagittal obliquity","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; functional anatomy; human; knee dislocation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; postoperative complication; surgical technique; tendon graft; tibia; treatment outcome; treatment planning","","","","","","","Howell, Stephen M., Tibial tunnel placement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions and graft impingement, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 283, pp. 187-195, (1992); Howell, Stephen M., Unimpinged and impinged anterior cruciate ligament grafts: MR signal intensity measurements, Radiology, 179, 3, pp. 639-643, (1991); Howell, Stephen M., Failure of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament due to impingement by the intercondylar roof, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 75, 7, pp. 1044-1055, (1993); Morgan, Craig D., Definitive landmarks for reproducible tibial tunnel placement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 3, pp. 275-288, (1995); Jackson, Douglas W., Tibial tunnel placement in ACL reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 10, 2, pp. 124-131, (1994); Tomczak, Reinhard J., Tunnel placement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: MRI analysis as an important factor in the radiological report, Skeletal Radiology, 26, 7, pp. 409-413, (1997); Clancy, William G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using one-third of the patellar ligament, augmented by extra-articular tendon transfers, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 64, 3, pp. 352-359, (1982); Harner, Christopher Dechant, Quantitative analysis of human cruciate ligament insertions, Arthroscopy, 15, 7, pp. 741-749, (1999); Odensten, Magnus, Functional anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament and a rationale for reconstruction, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 2, pp. 257-262, (1985); Sidles, John A., Ligament length relationships in the moving knee, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 6, 4, pp. 593-610, (1988)","M.A. Ayerza; Inst.

However, no existing clinical studies show adequate support for the choice of one graft over the other. Hypothesis: Hamstring tendons are equally as good as patellar tendon in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. Study Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial. Methods: Ninety-nine patients with laxity caused by a torn anterior cruciate ligament underwent arthroscopically assisted reconstruction with graft randomization according to their birth year. Grafts were either bone-patellar tendon-bone with metal interference screw fixation or double-looped hamstring tendons with metal plate fixation. There were no significant differences between the two groups preoperatively or at operation. Standard rehabilitation included immediate postoperative mobilization without a knee brace, protected weightbearing for 2 weeks, and return to full activity at 6 to 12 months. Results: Forty-three patients in the patellar tendon group and 46 patients in the hamstring tendon group were available for clinical evaluation at a minimum of 21 months after surgery. No statistically significant differences were seen with respect to clinical and instrumented laxity testing, International Knee Documentation Committee Score ratings, isokinetic muscle torque measurements, and Kujala patellofemoral, Lysholm, and Tegner scores. Conclusion: Equal results were seen for patellar and hamstring tendon autograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions at 2 years after surgery. Both techniques seem to improve patients' performance. © 2003 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; clinical trial; hamstring; human; intermethod comparison; knee function; knee ligament injury; knee radiography; ligament surgery; major clinical study; muscle strength; patella tendon; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; scoring system; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison between patellar tendon and doubled semitendinosus/gracilis tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Hamstring tendon grafts have been increasingly used as an alternative, but there are very few controlled studies comparing the methods. Hypothesis: Use of semitendinosus tendon grafts will cause less donor site morbidity and result in better knee-walking ability. Study Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial. Methods: Seventy-one patients who had a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture underwent arthroscopic reconstruction with interference screw fixation and use of either bone-patellar tendon-bone or semitendinosus tendon graft. Outcome assessment was performed by physiotherapists not involved in the patients' care. Results: At the 2-year follow-up, no differences were found in terms of the Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side laxity measurement, single-legged hop test, or International Knee Documentation Committee classification results. The knee-walking test was rated difficult or impossible to perform by 53% of the bone-patellar tendon-bone group and by only 23% of the semitendinosus graft patients, a significant difference. Conclusions: The semitendinosus tendon graft is at least an equivalent option to the bone-patellar tendon-bone graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and we recommend its use. © 2003 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; clinical trial; follow up; human; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee ligament injury; ligament surgery; major clinical study; muscle strength; patella tendon; physiotherapist; priority journal; prospective study; rating scale; semitendinous muscle; tendon graft; treatment outcome; walking; weight bearing","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Boszotta, Harald, Refilling of removal defects: Impact on extensor mechanism complaints after use of a bone-tendon-bone graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 16, 2, pp. 160-164, (2000); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, Closing patellar tendon defects after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Absence of any benefit, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 2, pp. 82-87, (1998); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, Is a knee brace advantageous after anterior cruciate ligament surgery?

Method: IKDC, Tegner and Lysholm scores were used for clinical evaluation. Ligament stability was tested using the Rolimeter instrument. For statistics we used the Chi square test. Results: At follow-up the Tegner activity level was 5.2, the Lysholm score was 93.6 points. Subjective assessment for function was rated normal or nearly normal in 83.7%, for stability in 71.6%. The side-to-side difference measured with the Rolimeter was normal in 87.8% and nearly normal in 12.2%. Pivot shift was proven to be negative in 94.6%. 29.7% of patients showed degenerative changes in X-rays at folllow-up. There was a significant correlation between time interval from injury to sugery and the grade of degenerative changes. Arthrosis significantly correlates with the rate of meniscus injury. Acute operative treatment increases the rate of arthrofibrosis significantly. Conclusion: To avoid osteoarthrosis we recommend an early (subacute) ACL reconstruction and meniscus refixation in the case of meniscus injury.","ACL reconstruction; Long-term results; Patellar tendon; Progression of osteoarthrosis","anterior cruciate ligament; article; autograft; controlled study; correlation analysis; follow up; human; incision; knee function; knee instability; knee meniscus rupture; knee radiography; ligament surgery; major clinical study; medical assessment; osteoarthritis; patella tendon; surgical technique; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis; Postoperative Complications; Risk Factors; Tendon Transfer; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Hawkins, Richard J., Followup of the acute nonoperated isolated anterior cruciate ligament tear, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 3, pp. 205-210, (1986); Noyes, Frank R., The symptomatic anterior cruciate-deficient knee.

Type of Study: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction at the University of Chicago, demonstrating a full and painless range of motion and no other knee ligament injury or history of previous knee surgery, were eligible. Twenty-six patients, with an average age of 25 years (range, 16 to 48) were enrolled. Average time from injury to reconstruction was 8 weeks. The patients' contralateral knee served as an internal control, and 26 age-matched and gender-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled as an external control group. ACL reconstructions were performed using a single-incision technique with either bone-patellar tendon-bone or quadrupled hamstring autograft. They were allowed immediate weightbearing as tolerated and participated in a standardized rehabilitation program, with the goal of returning to sport at approximately 6 months. Proprioception testing was carried out using an electrogoniometer, in a seated position. Joint position sense (JPS) and threshold to detection of passive motion (TDPM) were measured preoperatively and at 3 and 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Results: Mean KT-2000 values 6 months postoperatively were 1.38 mm (±2). Modified Lysholm score improved significantly (P < .01). Calculated r values were 0.65 for JPS and 0.96 for TDPM. No significant differences in postoperative proprioception were found between hamstring and patellar tendon grafts or among patients with meniscus injury, meniscus repair, or chondral injury. Preoperatively, the mean TDPM in both the injured and contralateral knees was significantly higher (worse) than in the external control knees (P = .008; P = .016). Evaluation of changes in proprioception from preoperative to 6 months postoperative showed significant improvement in both injured and contralateral knees (P = .04; P = .01). At 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference from controls. Conclusions: TDPM was a more reliable method than JPS for testing proprioception before and after ACL reconstruction in this study. Bilateral deficits in knee joint proprioception (TDPM) were documented after unilateral ACL injury. Reconstruction of a mechanical restraint (ACL graft) was believed to have a significantly positive impact on early and progressive improvement in proprioception.","ACL Reconstruction; Proprioception","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autograft; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; goniometry; hamstring; human; knee arthroplasty; male; patella tendon; proprioception; reliability; surgical technique","","","","","University of Chicago; Pritzker School of Medicine; Arthroscopy Association of North America, AANA","From the Orthopaedic Sports Medicine Service, the University of Chicago Sports Medicine; the Pritzker School of Medicine, the University of Chicago; the University of Chicago Hospitals, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.

Purpose: Our purpose was to determine the relationship between meniscal status at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and ultimate long-term function and stability. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: We prospectively studied 63 patients for an average of 10.4 years after arthroscopically assisted bone-patellar tendon-bone anterior cruciate reconstruction. All surgeries were performed between 1988 and 1991; concomitant meniscal surgery was performed if necessary. Subjects were divided into subgroups relative to the integrity of their menisci at the end of the reconstruction procedure (intact meniscus, partial meniscectomy, complete meniscectomy). Results: Patients who had undergone any degree of meniscal resection reported significantly more subjective complaints and activity limitations than those with intact menisci. Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores were lower in the meniscectomy subgroups than in the meniscus-intact group. Objective testing revealed a significantly lower ability to perform the single-legged hop in the meniscectomy subgroups. Ligament stability based on instrumented laxity measurements was not significantly different between the subgroups. Radiographic abnormalities were also more common in the subgroups that had undergone meniscectomy. Conclusions: The menisci should be repaired if at all possible, especially in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, for optimal functional outcome and patient satisfaction. © 2002 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; joint laxity; knee function; knee instability; knee meniscus; knee radiography; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; meniscectomy; patient satisfaction; priority journal; prospective study; scoring system; symptomatology","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison between medial meniscus repair, partial meniscectomy, and normal meniscus in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 307, pp. 165-173, (1994); Allen, Christina Ruth, Importance of the medial meniscus in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 18, 1, pp. 109-115, (2000); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Hypothesis: Patients who had augmentation will have better outcomes after 8 years. Study Design: Prospective randomized case control study. Methods: Between 1991 and 1993, 100 patients were randomized to groups undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts with (49) or without (51) use of a Kennedy ligament augmentation device. Of these 100 patients, 94 were examined at an average of 8 years after surgery. Fifteen patients were excluded because of rupture in the other knee and 11 because of rerupture in the same knee. Results: Of the remaining 68 patients, the mean Lysholm function score was 84 in the augmentation group and 87 in the control group. There was a statistically significant relationship between preoperatively detected cartilage injury and osteoarthritis. Almost half of the patients had developed osteoarthritis. We observed no significant difference between the two groups concerning rerupture rate, Lysholm or Lachman test scores, or KT-1000 arthrometer measurements.

Return to former sports levels and early osteoarthrotic changes were especially focussed. Examination included 50 athletes (32 men, 18 women) who underwent meniscal repair in inside-out technique during the period of 1989 to 1998. 23 patients had isolated full-thickness meniscal tears, 27 an associated rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament which was reconstructed in 13 cases with a patellar-tendon autograft. 3 study groups were formed referring to the athletes preoperative sports level evaluated with Tegner's score. Reexamination included Lysholm score, IKDC score and Fairbank's score. With a mean age of 32.1 years (range 13-53 years) and an average follow-up of 6.3 years 72% of the patients (n = 36) showed a stable joint function on reexamination. With no persisting anterior knee instability 86% of the professional athletes returned to former full sports activities on competitive levels. Non competitive athletes returned in all cases (100%) to their former level. Fairbank's score increased by 0.1 observing minimal osteoarthitic signs. However, persisting anterior knee instability showed on reexamination poor results. Only one third of all athletes were able to return to former activity levels. Osteoarthritic changes were observed in all patients. Professional athletes had the most severe osteoarthritic changes with a significant (p = 0.03) increase of 0.8 in Fairbank's score. The results demonstrate that complete recovery on sports activities after meniscal repair is not possible without reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Isolated meniscal repair shows poor results in persisting anterior knee instability and does not prevent increasing osteoarthritic changes in athletes.","Chronic anterior knee instability; Meniscal repair; Osteoarthritic changes; Sports injury","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; autograft; chronic disease; convalescence; disease association; female; follow up; human; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee instability; knee meniscus rupture; male; osteoarthritis; outcomes research; patella tendon; retrospective study; scoring system; sport; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Athletic Injuries; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Suture Techniques; Tendon Transfer","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison between medial meniscus repair, partial meniscectomy, and normal meniscus in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 307, pp. 165-173, (1994); Baratz, Mark E., Meniscal tears: The effect of meniscectomy and of repair on intraarticular contact areas and stress in the human knee.

The question is, if the results of an ACL reconstruction in patients over 40 years of age are as good as those in younger patients. Method: From 1989 to 1994 we replaced the ACL with a mid-third BPTB autograft in 397 patients following ACL rupture. A total of 309 patients (78%, 110 female, 199 male, the average age was 27 years) were followed for an average of 43 months. The results were compared relating to four groups of age (group 1: < 20 years, n = 41; group 2: 20-29 years, n = 175; group 3: 30-40 years, n = 77; group 4: > 40 years, n = 16). Results: We did not find any significant differences between the groups in the different score ratings, the subjective and objective knee function and stability, the pain and the level of activity. The average Cincinnati score of the whole group was 91 points (HSS score: 78/16% excellent/good, Lysholm score: 90 points, IKDC score: 22/31% A/B). Conclusion: ACL replacement is a sufficient therapy for patients over 40 years of age with symptomatic knee instability following ACL rupture. The subjective and objective clinical outcome is comparable to the good results of ACL replacement in younger patients without any significant differences.","ACL replacement; Age; Knee instability","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; female; human; joint stability; knee instability; major clinical study; male; rating scale; scoring system; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Roentgen Stereophotogrammetry Analysis (RSA) is a three-dimensional motion analysis method that has been shown to be an accurate tool for evaluating joint kinematics. Thus, RSA provides a means that can be used to evaluate other less invasive techniques. The objectives of this study were to compare A-P laxity values as measured using the KT-1000 Knee Arthrometer, planar stress radiography and RSA, and to determine if they detect similar changes in A-P laxity over time in 15 subjects following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon autografts. The A-P laxity values of the injured knee were measured immediately following surgery and at their 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits. A-P laxity was defined as the A-P translation of the tibia relative to the femur that occurred between the posterior and anterior shear load limits of -90 to +130 N, respectively. The values of A-P laxity across all time points were 11.4 ± 3.0, 10.2 ± 3.3, and 6.9 ± 3.0 mm (mean ± standard deviation) for the KT-1000, planar stress radiography and the RSA methods, respectively. These values were significantly different from each other (p<0.001). The two-dimensional analyses techniques (planar stress radiography and the KT-1000) consistently over-estimated the true laxity values that were obtained using the three-dimensional RSA technique. Significant increases in A-P laxity values over time were also detected with the KT-1000 (p = 0.04) and the RSA technique (p = 0.04). However, this increase was not evident when using planar stress radiography (p=0.89). This study determined that the KT-1000 and RSA document temporal changes in A-P laxity following ACL reconstruction that were not documented by planar stress radiography. © 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The measurements were performed on 86 patients on average 7 years after the surgery. The clinical evaluation was performed using the standard knee ligament evaluation form of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm and the Marshall knee scores. At seven years, the isokinetic mean strength deficit of knee extension at the 60° per second was 10% in the operated limb as compared to the contralateral limb (NS). In the knee flexion, the differences were even smaller and statistically not significant either. The strength deficit of the knee extension at all knee angle velocities (p < 0.005), and flexion at 60 degrees per second (p < 0.05), correlated to the one legged hop testing, so that the patients with the greatest strength deficit also had the worst outcome in the one legged hop test. Also, the correlation between thigh atrophy and the deficit in the isokinetic strength test was significant in knee extension at all knee angle velocities (p < 0.001), and in knee flexion at 180° per second (p < 0.005). In the final evaluation of the IKDC, 21 patients were rated as ""normal"", 51 as ""nearly normal"", 13 as ""abnormal"", and one as ""severely abnormal"". The mean of the Lysholm score was 83, classified as good, and that of Marshall score 43, classified as good. In conclusion, the one legged hop testing, as a functional muscle strength testing after an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, seems to correlate well with the isokinetic strength testing of the knee, especially in the knee extension. Because the hop testing can be easily performed and without extra equipment, we recommend its use for the evaluation of the functional muscle performance after an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The measurement of the thigh atrophy is also easy to perform, and should be used beside the one legged hop testing, especially if the isokinetic strength testing is not available.","ACL reconstruction; Hop testing; Isokinetic testing; Muscle performance; Thigh atrophy","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autograft; correlation analysis; female; functional assessment; human; knee arthroplasty; knee function; major clinical study; male; measurement; muscle atrophy; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; scoring system; validation process; Analysis of Variance; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Exercise Test; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Kinetics; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscles; Postoperative Period; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Antonopoulos, J., Anterior tibial translation related to isokinetic concentric quadriceps torques, Isokinetics and Exercise Science, 6, 2, pp. 145-151, (1996); Barber-Westin, Sue D., A rigorous comparison between the sexes of results and complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 4, pp. 514-526, (1997); Clancy, William G., Arthroscopic anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction technique, Annales Chirurgiae et Gynaecologiae, 80, 2, pp. 141-148, (1991); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior knee laxity in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament disruption, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 6, pp. 401-407, (1985); Donatelli, Robert A., Open and closed kinetic chain strength training verse functional exercises to improve performance in patients with ACL reconstructed knees: A prospective study, Isokinetics and Exercise Science, 6, 1, pp. 7-13, (1996); Feiring, David C., Single versus multiple joint isokinetic testing with ACL reconstructed patients, Isokinetics and Exercise Science, 6, 2, pp. 109-115, (1996); Fu, Freddie H., Current trends in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

The purpose of this study was to analyze mid-term results and assess prognosis factors. Material and methods: All patients underwent artrhoscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using a central one-third patellar tendon graft. Full follow-up data were available for 51 patients (52 knees) and partial data for 24 others (25 knees). Eight patients (9 knees) were lost to follow-up. The IKDC criteria were used to analyze outcome at a mean 6 years post-surgery. Results: Graft failure was observed in 5 knees and a graft tears after a new sprain was seen at 3 years. The patients were satisfied or very satisfied in 88.5% of the cases. The Trillat-Lachman test revealed a persistent dampened brake in 5 knees and a frank click in 4 (7.7%). Complete movement was recovered in all knees excepting 2 exhibiting persistent flexion. Residual laxity (active Lachman test) was 5 mm in 81.5% of the cases, between 6 and 10 mm in 17%, and greater than 10 mm in only 1 case (2.5%). IKDC scores were A = 25%, B = 50%, C = 21% and D = 4%. Forty-two patients (61%) returned to their sports activities and 9 of the 12 high-level athletes resumed competition at the same level as preoperatively. Arthroscopy enabled a well- or very well-positioned femoral tunnel in 88% of the cases, conditioning final IKDC outcome (p < 0.02). There was a correlation between the meniscal status and residual laxity. Discussion: This study demonstrated a high proportion (21%) of patients with an incomplete repair (21% IKDC class C) with a residual laxity greater than 5 mm and a late hard brake. Simple patellar tendon graft provided insufficient repair of the anterior cruciate ligament. The subjective outcome was better than the objective outcome since 88.5% of the patients were satisfied or very satisfied (patients seen at last follow-up or contacted by telephone). Good objective outcome was correlated with good femoral position of the transplant and preservation of the meniscus. Failures were explained by poor position of the transplant, long-standing laxity, and renewal of sports activities too early. Conclusion: Arthroscopic repair of the anterior cruciate ligament is a reliable procedure, but as failures are observed, indications should take into consideration the type of laxity and the status of the meniscus. For unique anterior laxity, the central one-third patellar tendon graft gives good results. For advanced anterior laxity, augmentation with an extra-articular lateral tenodesis would be necessary.","ACL; ACL reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Graft; Meniscus","anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; competition; correlation analysis; graft failure; human; joint laxity; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee meniscus; knee radiography; major clinical study; prognosis; retrospective study; sport; treatment indication; treatment outcome; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Transplantation; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Tendons; Time Factors","","","","","","","Laffargue, Philippe, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Arthrotomy versus arthroscopy, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 85, 4, pp. 367-373, (1999); Index Traumat Sport, (1998); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993); Greffe Libre Du Ligament Croise Anterieur Assistee Par Arthroscopie Resultats Precoces De 86 Cas Avec Un Recul Minimum De Un an, (1996); Dejour, Henri, Tibial translation after anterior cruciate ligament rupture: Two radiological tests compared, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 76, 5, pp. 745-749, (1994); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to assess the five-year outcome after ACL plasty in patients aged over 40 at the time of surgery. Material and methods: Between 1990 and 1997, 41 patients aged 44.5 ± 4.5 years (28 men, 25 right side) underwent intra-articular reconstruction of the ACL. Clinical and radiological assessment using the IKDC criteria was obtained at a mean 62 months postoperatively using manual instrumental measurements with KT-1000. The indication for reconstruction was instability in daily life activities for 40 patients and difficulties encountered in sports activities in one; there were three cases of remodeling. Arthroscopy was used in all cases to perform a patellar tendon graft (bone-tendon-bone in 30 cases associated with extra-articular lateral reinforcement in eleven). Results There were no significant complications. Among 12 patients who initially participated in competition sports, seven were able to resume their activity at their former level. At last follow-up, global IKDC score was A for 12, B for 25, and C for three and D for one. All patients scored C or D had a poor IKDC symptom score, basically because of pain. Motion was not modified. The IKDC radiology score was A for 25, B for 15 and C for one, but the three cases of remodeling did not progress. Prognostic factors for overall IKDC result were: age of the patient at the time of reconstruction (under 45 years), and the delay to surgery for accident victims (less than one year). The following criteria had no effect at last follow-up: gender, sport practiced, type of initial laxity (anterior alone or global anterior), presence of meniscal damage, preservation of the medial and/or lateral meniscus, chondral injury observed peroperatively, and use of a lateral reinforcement. Radiographic remodeling observed in this group of 41 patients was related to delay from accident to surgery (p = 0.0007) and preservation of the medial meniscus (p = 0.03). Age, gender, type of activity before surgery, degree of initial and residual laxity had no statistically significant effect on remodeling. Conclusion: Age over 40 years is not a contraindication for arthroscopic free patellar tendon graft for the treatment of chronic anterior laxity. Using rigorous preoperative assessment criteria (delay from accident to surgery, absence of joint space narrowing on the AP and lateral view before intervention, symptomatic instability in daily life activities and motivated patient) this type of procedure can be performed safely and provides good functional outcome at five years. The current follow-up is insufficient to judge potential joint degradation. Age is not a contraindication if certain precautions are taken.","Anterior curciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Knee; Ligamentoplasy","accident; adult; age; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; clinical examination; competition; female; follow up; human; joint mobility; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee instability; knee meniscus rupture; knee radiography; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; postoperative complication; prognosis; retrospective study; scoring system; sport; statistical analysis; symptomatology; tendon graft; treatment contraindication; treatment indication; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Dejour, Henri, Chronic anterior laxity of the knee treated by free patellar graft and extra-articular lateral plasty: Long term results on 148 cases, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 85, 8, pp. 777-789, (1999); Dejour, Henri, Results of operated chronic anterior laxities. 251 cases reviewed with a minimum 3 year follow-up, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 74, 7, pp. 622-636, (1988); Fu, Freddie H., Anterior cruciate ligament surgery 1996: State of the art?, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 325, pp. 19-24, (1996); Lerat, Jean Luc, 10 to 16 years follow-up results of 138 anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability of the knee using the central third of the patellar tendon augmented by extra-articular plasty, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 84, 8, pp. 712-727, (1998); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Shelbourne, K.

Material and method: This non-randomized study included 129 consecutive patients operated on between October 1996 and September 1998. Ninety patients were available for assessment at one year: 50 in the patellar tendon group and 40 in the hamstring tendon group. The two groups were comparable for all criteria except sex. A single operator assessed all patients using the IKDC 93 chart. Laxity was measured by comparison with the healthy knee using the KT1000 at maximal manual tension. Preoperative laxity was 8.0 ± 3.0 mm in the patellar tendon group and 7.6 ± 3.0 in the hamstring tendon group. All ligamentoplasties were performed arthroscopically using a blind femoral tunnel. The patellar tendon was fixed with two metallic interference screws and the four-strand hamstring autografts with two different methods: an RCI® interference screw or a cortical system associating a femoral Endobutton® and tibial fixation with a bicortical tibial screw. Lateral tendonesis was performed with the fascia lata in 60% of the patients in the patellar tendon group and in 45% of those in the hamstring tendon group. Rehabilitation exercises were initiated early and were the same in the two groups. Results: Overall results were satisfactory in more than 80% of the patients in both groups. The final IKDC score was significantly better in the patellar tendon group and subjective patient satisfaction was better in the hamstrings group. Residual pain was significantly less pronounced in the hamstrings tendon group (p = 0.004). Laxity was improved significantly better in the patellar tendon group: average residual laxity = 2.7 ± 2.1 mm versus 4.5 ± 2.8 mm (p = 0.03) in the hamstrings tendon group; hard stop at the Lachman test in 96% of the patellar tendon group and 78% in the hamstrings tendon group (p = 0.007). Residual laxity was significantly less pronounced in the women in the patellar tendon group. There was no significant difference in laxity by type of fixation in the hamstrings tendon group. Recovery in terms of level of activity and type of sport was the same in the two groups. Discussion: These two surgical techniques provide good functional outcome at one year with better control of laxity with patellar tendon autografts and better relief of pain with four-strand hamstrings autografts. Longer follow-up would be useful to assess laxity long after hamstring reconstruction. We compared the type of transplant and the fixation method together as a single unity, but progress in four-strand hamstring autograft fixation will certainly allow even more optimal results and improved correction of laxity. In our opinion, the patellar tendon autograft remains the gold standard for high-performance athletes practicing a contact-pivot sport, but both types of ACL reconstruction are most useful. We select patients for four-strand hamstring tendon reconstruction as a function of age, sex, and type of sports activities.","Chronic anterior laxity; Hamstrings; Ligamentoplasty; Patellar tendon","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; autograft; bone screw; device; female; follow up; functional assessment; hamstring; human; intermethod comparison; joint laxity; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; knee function; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; patient satisfaction; physical activity; preoperative evaluation; scoring system; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons; Time Factors","","","Endobutton; RCI","","","","Frank, Cyril Basil, The science of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 79, 10, pp. 1556-1576, (1997); Engebretsen, Lars, A prospective, randomized study of three surgical techniques for treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 6, pp. 585-590, (1990); Grøntvedt, Torbjørn, A prospective, randomized study of three operations for acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament: Five-year follow-up of one hundred and thirty-one patients, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 78, 2, pp. 159-168, (1996); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Patients and methods: The study was based on 61 consecutive ACL reconstructions using an allograft from the central third of the patellar tendon and an arthroscopic monotunnel technique. The femoral tunnel was made in the isometric area and the tibial tunnel in the posterior part of the area of the ACL anatomic footprint. Knees with associated meniscal or chondral disease were excluded, as well as cases in which other ligaments were involved. Results: After an average follow-up of 6 years, manual testing of knee stability revealed a negative Lachman test and pivot-shift test in 69% and 91% of patients, respectively. The Genucom® laxity test disclosed anterior and anterolateral translations of less than 5 mm in 57 (93%) and 59 (98%) of cases. According to the IKDC protocol, 59 knees were normal or almost normal. The average score of the Lysholm test was 91 points and of the Tegner activity scale, 6.9. Only two patients had postoperative extension deficits, due to arthrofibrosis and cyclops syndrome, respectively, which responded well to surgery. No degenerative radiological changes were detected. Conclusions: The results suggest that this type of reconstruction achieves satisfactory intermediate-term stability with a low rate of complications.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone-tendon-bone; Knee; Notchplasty; Surgery","adolescent; adult; allograft; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; child; female; follow up; human; knee instability; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; postoperative complication; retrospective study; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Amis, Andrew Arthur, Functional anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament.

The use of personalised three-dimensional (3D) models of the bones enabled us to ensure a reproducible measurement of three-dimensional kinematic and laxity parameters. Our results showed that even when knee laxity was restored to normal, 3D kinematic measurements revealed that the reconstructions tended to under or over-constrain the knee's movement.

Material: We investigated 41 sportsmen with a lowfield MRI after an ACL-reconstruction and correlated the results with a second look arthroscopy. We measured parasagittal SE-T1-, TSE-T2- and STIR-images. There are four types of arthroscopic assessment (7). Type 1: Tight ACL-like graft with synovial coating, type 2: Tight bundle-like graft with incomplete synovial coating, type 3: Lax untidy structured graft, type 4: rudimentary graft. Results: In 31 sportsmen we found in the TSE-T2 weighted images a low signal, smooth and tight graft. In the SE-T1 images 20 sportsmen showed this case of graft. In STIR-images we had 15 sportsmen. In the secondlook arthroscopy we saw 20 sportsmen with a type-1-graft and 16 with a type-2-graft and 4 sportsmen had a type-3-graft. In 30 of 31 sportsmen who showed a low signal, smooth and tight graft in the TSE-T2-images we found a type-1- or type-2-graft in the secondlook arthroscopy. Conclusion: There is a good visualisation in lowfield-MRI of the patellar tendon graft in sportsmen. Even in the critical peroid (3.-24. month) we found a good correlation between MRI and arthroscopy in TSE-T2-images and we had no increase of signal. Early diagnosis of postoperative problems like rerupture, graft failure and laxitity is possible and therapeutic procedures can initiated.","ACL-reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Correlation; MRI","","","","","","","","Autz, George, Magnetic resonance evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament repair using the patellar tendon double bone block technique, Skeletal Radiology, 20, 8, pp. 585-588, (1991); Bellelli, Alberto, La maturazione sinoviale dei legamenti crociati ricostruiti, Radiologia Medica, 98, 6, pp. 454-461, (1999); Bernard, Manfred, Femoral insertion of the ACL.

Their surgical technique have been described and early results have been compared with those from anterior cruciate ligament plasties with the interference screw fixation technique during a prospective study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 665 anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were performed between September 1997 and August 1999 at the Department of Sports Surgery of the National Institute for Sports Medicine. 418 of them were operated on by transtibial technique using free bone--patellar tendon--bone autografts with 265 femoral press-fit and 153 interference screw fixations. 110 patients from the press-fit and 72 from the interference screw group could be followed-up (average follow-up period: 19 months). Physical examination, evaluation by International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores, radiology, and stability test by KT-1000 arthrometer were used as follow-up tests with statistical comparison. RESULTS: According to the International Knee Documentation Committee score, 77% of the patients with the interference screw and 87% of the patients from the press-fit group turned out to get to the normal or nearly normal categories. Neither the Lachman, anterior drawer and pivot shift tests, nor the results of the KT-1000 measurements have shown statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients. Mild (3-5 degrees) extension deficit has been detected at 14% of the patients with interference screw and 8% of the patients in the press-fit group. Mild (6-15 degrees) flexion deficit has been observed at 22% of the patients with interference screw and 24% of the patients from press-fit group with moderate (16-25 degrees) of flexion deficit at 4% of the patients. The subjective opinions of more than 90% of the patients were that the operation proved to be excellent or good. Based on the functional and stability data of the follow-up study, 87% of the patients operated on with femoral press-fit autograft fixation technique for their anterior cruciate ligament have shown excellent or good results. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with the interference screw technique well-accepted in the literature, no statistically significant difference could be found, therefore this method can be recommended as alternative one for the femoral fixation of the anterior cruciate ligament graft.","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; bone transplantation; convalescence; female; femur; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; methodology; orthopedic surgery; patella; pathophysiology; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Transplantation; Female; Femur; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Patella; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","A.

However, improper insertion of the screws may reduce primary stability, injure the posterior femoral cortex, or displace hardware into the joint. Even if placed properly, metallic screws interfere with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. In case of revision surgery, removing screws may be difficult and leaves bone defects. Type of Study: Retrospective study. Methods: An arthroscopic technique was developed that achieves patellar tendon autograft fixation by press-fit without any supplemental internal fixation. Forty patients were examined clinically and by KT-1000 arthrometer 28.7 months (range, 22 to 40 months) postoperatively. Results: The mean difference in side-to-side laxity was 1.3 mm (SD 2.2) and the results according to the IKDC score were as follows: 7 A, 28 B, 5 C, and 0 D. Conclusions: The double press-fit technique we present avoids all complications related to the use of interference screws and creates an ideal environment for osseous integration of the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. Concurrently, it achieves a stable fixation of the autograft and allows early functional rehabilitation. However, fixation strength depends on bone quality and the arthroscopic procedure is demanding.","ACL reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft; Press-fit technique","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone graft; bone screw; clinical article; debridement; double press fit technique; female; human; interference screw fixation; isometric exercise; knee arthroscopy; lavage; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteosynthesis; patella fracture; patella tendon; retrospective study; scoring system; surgical technique; weight bearing; wound healing; wound infection","","","KT-1000 arthrometer","","","","Kannus, Pekka A., Conservatively treated tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Type of Study: Prospective clinical study. Methods: Ten consecutive patients underwent arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction using the mid-third bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft. The tendon defect was left open and the paratenon was approximated with sutures. Tantalum beads were inserted in the distal part of the patella and in the tibial tuberosity through the bone defects. The distance between the tantalum markers in the patella and the tibial tuberosity was measured with RSA at the first day and at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Results: A decrease of patellar tendon length was observed in all cases. The amount of shortening averaged 1.6 mm (range, 0.5 to 3.2 mm), 3.2% of the initial length. In 4 patients, tendon shortening was detected during the first 4 weeks after surgery. In 6 cases, decrease of patellar tendon length started between the fourth and the eighth week. The shortening process continued in 8 knees until the 12th week. No further changes in patellar tendon length were observed after the 12th postoperative week. In 2 patients, shortening of the patella tendon exceeded 2 mm. The amount of patellar tendon shortening was not related to anterior knee pain. Conclusions: After removing the BPTB autograft, irreversible shortening of the remaining two thirds of the patellar tendon occurred during the first 12 postoperative weeks.","Anterior cruciate ligament; BPTB graft; Patella height; Patellar tendon; Roentgen-stereometric-analysis","tantalum; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; female; follow up; height; human; knee function; knee instability; knee radiography; knee surgery; male; outcomes research; patella height; patella tendon; postoperative complication; stereometry; tendon graft; tibia tuberosity","","tantalum, 7440-25-7","","","","","Duri, Zaid A.A., Patellar tendonitis and anterior knee pain., The American journal of knee surgery, 12, 2, pp. 99-108, (1999); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Factors affecting donor-site morbidity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 4, pp. 222-228, (1997); Kleipool, Arthur E.B., Pain after use of the central third of the patellar tendon for cruciate ligament reconstruction: 33 patients followed 2-3 years, Acta Orthopaedica, 65, 1, pp. 62-66, (1994); Sachs, Raymond A., Patellofemoral problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 6, pp. 760-765, (1989); Muellner, Thomas, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction alters the patellar alignment, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 15, 2, pp. 165-168, (1999); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, Closing patellar tendon defects after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Absence of any benefit, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 2, pp. 82-87, (1998); Breitfuss, H., The tendon defect after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the midthird patellar tendon-a problem for the patellofemoral joint?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 194-198, (1996); Chase, J.

Type of Study: Case series. Methods: This study population included 26 men and 9 women with 19 acute and 16 chronic knee injuries. Ligament injuries included 19 ACL/PCL/posterolateral instabilities, 9 ACL/PCL/medial cruciate ligament (MCL) instabilities, 6 ACL/PCL/posterolateral/MCL instabilities, and 1 ACL/PCL instability. All knees had grade III preoperative ACL/PCL laxity and were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively with arthrometer testing, 3 different knee ligament rating scales, stress radiography, and physical examination. Arthroscopically assisted combined ACL/PCL reconstructions were performed using the single-incision endoscopic ACL technique and the single femoral tunnel-single bundle transtibial tunnel PCL technique. PCLs were reconstructed with allograft Achilles tendon (in 26 cases), autograft bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) (in 7 cases), and autograft semitendinosus/gracilis (in 2 cases). ACLs were reconstructed with autograft BPTB (16 cases), allograft BPTB (12 cases), Achilles tendon allograft (6 cases), and autograft semitendinosus/gracilis (1 case). MCL injuries were treated with bracing or open reconstruction. Posterolateral instability was treated with biceps femoris tendon transfer, with or without primary repair, and posterolateral capsular shift procedures as indicated. Results: Postoperative physical examination revealed normal posterior drawer/tibial step-off in 16 of 35 (46%) knees. Normal Lackman and pivot-shift test results were found in 33 of 35 (94%) knees. Posterolateral stability was restored to normal in 6 of 25 (24%) knees, and tighter than normal knee results were found in 19 of 25 (76%) knees evaluated with the external rotation thigh foot angle test. In this group, 30° varus stress testing was normal in 22 of 25 (88%) knees, and grade 1 laxity was found in 3 of 25 (12%) knees. 30° valgus stress testing was normal in 7 of 7 (100%) surgically treated MCL tears, and in 7 of 8 (87.5%) brace-treated knees. Postoperative KT-1000 arthrometer testing mean side-to-side difference measurements were 2.7 mm (PCL screen), 2.6 mm (corrected posterior), and 1.0 mm (corrected anterior) measurements, a statistically significant improvement from preoperative status (P = .001). Postoperative stress radiographic side-to-side difference measurements measured at 90° of knee flexion and 32 lb posteriorly directed proximal force were 0 to 3 mm in 11 of 21 (52.3%) knees, 4 to 5 mm in 5 of 21 (23.8%), and 6 to 10 mm in 4 of 21 (19%) knees. Postoperative Lysholm, Tegner, and HSS knee ligament rating scale mean values were 91.2, 5.3, and 86.8, respectively, showing a statistically significant improvement from preoperative status (P = .001). Conclusions: Combined ACL/PCL instabilities can be successfully treated with arthroscopic reconstruction and the appropriate collateral ligament surgery. Statistically significant improvement is noted from the preoperative condition at 2- to 10-year follow-up using objective parameters of knee ligament rating scales, arthrometer testing, stress radiography, and physical examination. Postoperatively, these knees are not normal, but they are functionally stable. Continuing technical improvements will probably improve future results.","Allograft; Biceps tendon transfer; Combined ACL/PCL reconstruction; Multiple ligament injured knee","achilles tendon; article; autograft; bone stress; clinical article; evaluation; female; follow up; functional assessment; hospital for special surgery knee ligament rating scale; human; knee arthroscopy; knee ligament injury; knee radiography; kt 1000 arthrometer testing; ligament surgery; lysholm score; male; measurement; physical examination; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; rating scale; scoring system; statistical significance; surgical approach; surgical technique; tegner score; tendon graft","","","","","","","Fanelli, Gregory C., Posterior cruciate ligament injuries in trauma patients, Arthroscopy, 9, 3, pp. 291-294, (1993); Fanelli, Gregory C., Posterior cruciate ligament injuries in trauma patients: Part II, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 5, pp. 526-529, (1995); Fanelli, Gregory C., Arthroscopically assisted combined posterior cruciate ligament/posterior lateral complex reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 12, 5, pp. 521-530, (1996); Tegner, Yelverton, Rating systems in the evaluation of knee ligament injuries, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 198, pp. 43-49, (1985); Am J Knee Surg, (1988); Knee Ligaments Structure Function Injury and Repair, (1990); Fanelli, Gregory C., The posterior cruciate ligament arthroscopic evaluation and treatment, Arthroscopy, 10, 6, pp. 673-688, (1994); Malek, Mehrdad M., Technique of arthroscopically assisted PCL reconstruction, Orthopedics, 16, 9, pp. 961-966, (1993); Techniques in Therapeutic Arthroscopy, (1993); Knee, (1994)","G.C.

Methods: Fifty-six patients with a torn anterior cruciate ligament were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Twenty-eight underwent reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, and twenty-eight were treated with a two-strand semitendinosus-gracilis autograft. Patients were followed for an average of thirty-nine months (range, thirty-six to fifty-seven months). At the time of final follow-up, twenty-two patients in each group were evaluated in terms of clinical test findings, patient satisfaction, activity level, functional status, and isokinetic muscle strength. Results: The objective outcome of replacement of the torn anterior cruciate ligament with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was superior to that obtained with a two-strand semitendinosus-gracilis graft. At the three-year follow-up interval, the patients in whom a hamstring graft had been used had an average of 4.4 mm of increased anterior knee laxity compared with the laxity of the contralateral, normal knee, whereas the patients in whom a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had been used had an average of 1.1 mm of increased knee laxity. Fourteen percent (three) of the twenty-two patients with a hamstring graft had a mild pivot shift, and 27% (six) had a moderate pivot shift. Only 14% (three) of the twenty-two patients with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft had a mild pivot shift, and none had a moderate pivot shift. At the same follow-up interval, the patients in whom a hamstring graft had been used had significantly lower peak knee-flexion strength than those who had a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (p = 0.039). In contrast, the two treatments produced similar outcomes in terms of patient satisfaction, activity level, and knee function (ability to perform a one-legged hop, bear weight, squat, climb stairs, run in place, and duckwalk). Conclusions: After three years of follow-up, the objective results of anterior cruciate ligament replacement with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft were superior to those of replacement with a two-strand semitendinosusgracilis graft with regard to knee laxity, pivot-shift grade, and strength of the knee flexor muscles. However, the two groups had comparable results in terms of patient satisfaction, activity level, and knee function.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; bone graft; climbing; clinical examination; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; functional assessment; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; intermethod comparison; joint laxity; knee arthroplasty; knee function; major clinical study; male; muscle graft; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; patella tendon; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; running; semitendinous muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome; walking","","","","","","","Eriksson, Ejnar, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 7, 1, pp. 167-179, (1976); Feagin, John A., Isolated tear of the anterior cruciate ligament: 5-year follow-up study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 4, 3, pp. 95-100, (1976); Johnson, Robert J., The treatment of injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 74, 1, pp. 140-151, (1992); Butler, David L., Ligamentous restraints to anterior-posterior drawer in the human knee.

Although it is quite easy to perform, Endobutton fixation in ACL surgery requires that maximum care be taken to ensure that the Endobutton has flipped.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Endobutton; Pitfall","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; bone plate; case report; convalescence; equipment; human; injury; male; patella; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative complication; radiography; tendon; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Plates; Equipment Failure; Humans; Male; Patella; Postoperative Complications; Recovery of Function; Tendons","","","","","","","Barrett, Gene R., Endobutton button endoscopie fixation technique in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 3, pp. 340-343, (1995); Becker, Roland, Structural properties of sutures used in anchoring multistranded hamstrings in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A biomechanical study, Arthroscopy, 15, 3, pp. 297-300, (1999); Malek, Mehrdad M., Intraoperative complications of arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft., Instructional course lectures, 45, pp. 297-302, (1996); Muneta, Takeshi, Intra-articular detachment of the endobutton more than 18 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 15, 7, pp. 775-778, (1999); Techniques for Acl Reconstruction with Multi Trac Drill Guide, (1994); Simonian, Peter T., Potential pitfall of the EndoButton, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 14, 1, pp. 66-69, (1998)","S.

We have developed an innovative modified BHB method involving anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. It takes into account the 2 bundles of the ACL: The anteromedial bundle and the posterolateral bundle. The composite graft was prepared by folding the gracilis and the semitendi- nosus tendons twice and flanking the ends by bone blocks obtained from the tibia. One tunnel of 11-mm diameter was made in the tibia and the femur, and the top of the graft was introduced into the femoral socket; the distal end of the graft was rotated 90° in the counterclockwise direction for a right knee and 90° in the clockwise direction for a left knee to apply a twist to the graft, giving rise to an anteromedial bundle and a posterolateral bundle. The bone blocks attached to the graft were fixed with 2 interference screws. Modified BHB technique allows free selection of the location of the bone plug, minimizes the intra-articular length of the graft, and maintains the double-bundle structure of the original ACL.","Anatomic reconstruction; Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Modified bone-hamstring-bone composite graft","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopy; article; bone hamstring bone composite graft; composite graft; femur; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; knee arthroplasty; ligament surgery; semitendinous muscle; surgical anatomy; surgical approach; surgical technique; tendon graft; tibia; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Shino, Konsei, Deterioration of patellofemoral articular surfaces after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 206-211, (1993); Kurosaka, Masahiro, A biomechanical comparison of different surgical techniques of graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 225-229, (1987); Yamada, Ikufumi, Concept of the Sharpey screw, Knee, 5, 1, pp. 53-57, (1998); Yasuda, Kazunori 1., Muscle weakness after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar and quadriceps tendons, Bulletin of the Hospital for Joint Diseases Orthopaedic Institute, 51, 2, pp. 175-185, (1991); Brown, Charles H., The use of hamstring tendons for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Technique and results, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 12, 4, pp. 723-756, (1993); More, Robert C., Hamstrings—an anterior cruciate ligament protagonist: An in vitro study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 231-237, (1993); Zaricznyj, Basilius, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee using a doubled tendon graft, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 220, pp. 162-175, (1987); J Bone Joint Surg Am, (1993); Shino, Konsei, Comparison of eccentric and concentric screw placement for hamstring graft fixation in the tibial tunnel, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 8, 2, pp. 73-75, (2000); Maeda, Akira, Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with multistranded autogenous semitendinosus tendon, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 4, pp. 504-509, (1996)","","","","","","","","","07498063","","","11987070","English","Arthroscopy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036590534"

Fifty patients, undergoing an ACL reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, were postoperatively allocated randomly to either a plaster cast or a brace for 5 weeks. The brace group had ROM exercises from post-operative day 7. The commencement of ROM exercises was postponed 4 weeks for the plaster group compared to the brace group, but progressed subsequently with equal speed. There was no difference between the groups in the ROM of flexion or extension 20 weeks after the ACL reconstruction and later. Twenty-four months after surgery, the muscle strength deficit in the hamstring muscles (isokinetic measurements; percent difference, injured vs uninjured) was significantly larger in the brace group (mean ± SD: 5.9 ± 7.8%, P < 0.01) than in the plaster group (-0.9 ± 11.8%, NS) (brace vs plaster group, P <0.05). Furthermore, there was also a tendency in the brace group to a larger strength deficit in the quadriceps muscle (brace: 11.1 ± 13.2%, P <0.001; plaster: 3.8 ± 12.9%, NS) (brace vs plaster group, P = 0.07). There was no difference between the groups in the total sagittal knee laxity, as measured with an arthrometer, or in the subjective knee function or activity level (Lysholm score together with the Tegner activity level) between the groups. It is concluded that the postoperative treatment with early range of motion training after ACL reconstruction gave as good ROM, knee stability, subjective knee function and activity level as the treatment with immobilization. It is hypothesized that the larger strength deficit observed after rehabilitation with early range of motion training is secondary to the more intensive training and physical therapist involvement that was demanded in order to achieve full ROM following immobilization.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Early mobilization; Immobilization; Reconstruction; Rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; brace; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; immobilization; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; pathophysiology; plaster cast; plastic surgery; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rupture; skeletal muscle; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Braces; Casts, Surgical; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immobilization; Knee Injuries; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rupture","","","","","","","Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Andersson, Christer A., Instrumented testing for evaluation of sagittal knee laxity, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 256, pp. 178-184, (1990); Arms, Steven W., The biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation and reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 1, pp. 8-18, (1984); Barber-Westin, Sue D., The effect of rehabilitation and return to activity on anterior-posterior knee displacements after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 264-270, (1993); Beynnon, Bruce D., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strain Behavior During Rehabilitation Exercises In Vivo, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 24-34, (1995); Bynum, Edward Bruce, Open Versus Closed Chain Kinetic Exercises After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Prospective Randomized Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 4, pp. 401-406, (1995); Clancy, William G., Anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in rhesus monkeys.

Several methods for graft fixation have been described. To avoid intraarticular hardware we adopt biological fixation with a femoral conical press-fit fixation. A prospective study was performed on 40 consecutive active athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction with this technique by the same surgeon between November 1994 and September 1995 (mean follow-up 46 months, range 36-62). Results were evaluated by an independent examiner using radiography, computed tomography, subjective and objective evaluation, and isokinetic and functional strength tests. Assessment using the IKDC knee scoring revealed 85% of the patients with a normal or nearly normal knee joint; Tegner's score was 7.5 preoperatively and 6.0 postoperatively, with 60% of the athletes returning to the preinjury sport and level. No patients had instability, with 90% having less than 3 mm side-to-side difference on computerized analysis. The isokinetic test showed mild quadriceps deficit at 3 and 6 months, with no deficit at final follow-up; four patients complained of anterior knee pain and had a positive kneeling test. We found no graft dislocation. All cases showed radiological evidence of graft integration at 3 months time. Long-term results support this technique asx a simple, cost-effective, and reliable alternative for patellar tendon fixation in ACL reconstruction.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Fixation ligament; Knee; Patellar tendon; Press fit; Reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; convalescence; female; femur; follow up; human; injury; knee; male; orthopedic equipment; pathophysiology; physiology; plastic surgery; prospective study; radiography; sport injury; tendon; time; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee; Male; Orthopedic Fixation Devices; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Recovery of Function; Tendons; Time Factors","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Barber-Westin, Sue D., A rigorous comparison between the sexes of results and complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 4, pp. 514-526, (1997); Boszotta, Harald, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft in press-fit technique: Surgical technique and follow-up, Arthroscopy, 13, 3, pp. 332-339, (1997); Brand, Jeff C., Graft fixation in cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 28, 5, pp. 761-774, (2000); Clatworthy, Mark G., Tunnel widening in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective evaluation of hamstring and patella tendon grafts., Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA, 7, 3, pp. 138-145, (1999); Am J Knee Surg, (1988); Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Fahey, Mark, Bone Tunnel Enlargement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 410-414, (1994); Fink, Christian, Tibial tunnel enlargement following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft, Arthroscopy, 17, 2, pp. 138-143, (2001)","","","","","","","","","09422056","","","11914763","English","Knee Surg.

The groups were determined by knee laxity as measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer at the follow-up two to five years after the reconstruction. Group A (n= 15) had an anterior side-to-side laxity difference of <-3 mm (i.e. the reconstructed knee was less lax than the contralateral non-injured knee), Group B (n=376) had a difference of ≥-1, but ≤+2 mm and Group C (n=38) had a difference of ≥6 mm. All the patients had a normal contralateral knee. In Group A, 7/15 (47%) patients and, in Group B, 82/375 (22%) patients had an extension deficit of ≥5° (P=0.052). The corresponding values in terms of flexion deficit were 8/15 (53%) and 99/375 (26%) respectively (P=0.04) (one missing value in Group B). In Group C, 14/38 (37%) had an extension deficit (P=0.04; Group B vs Group C). Group C displayed worse results than Group B in terms of the Lysholm score and the one-leg-hop test (P=0.001 and P=0.011 respectively). The corresponding comparison between Group A and Group B revealed no significant differences. We conclude that a considerable number of patients showed persisting deficits in range of motion (ROM) after an ACL reconstruction. No major differences were found if they were analysed in subgroups with decreased, near normal or with increased knee laxity. The worst residual functional impairment, as measured with the Lysholm score and one-leg-hop test, was found in the group with increased knee laxity and most ROM deficits in the knees with decreased laxity.","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL); Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction; Knee function; Knee laxity","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; classification; clinical trial; comparative study; convalescence; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee injury; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; rupture; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Rupture; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Barber, Sue D., Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction: Function testing, Orthopedics, 15, 8, pp. 969-974, (1992); Bellamy, Nicholas, Validation study of WOMAC: A health status instrument for measuring clinically important patient relevant outcomes to antirheumatic drug therapy in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, Journal of Rheumatology, 15, 12, pp. 1833-1840, (1988); Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, A prospective four- to seven-year follow-up after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 11, 1, pp. 23-27, (2001); Clancy, William G., Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon, Techniques in Orthopaedics, 2, 4, pp. 13-22, (1988); Contemp Orthop, (1982); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior knee laxity in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament disruption, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 6, pp. 401-407, (1985); Eastlack, Marty E., Laxity, instability, and functional outcome after ACL injury: Copers versus noncopers, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 31, 2, pp. 210-215, (1999); Gauffin, Håkan, Function testing in patients with old rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, International Journal of Sports Medicine, 11, 1, pp. 73-77, (1990); Graf, Ben K., Risk factors for restricted motion after anterior cruciate reconstruction, Orthopedics, 17, 10, pp. 909-912, (1994); Harilainen, Arsi, Good muscle performance does not compensate instability symptoms in chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 3, pp. 135-137, (1995)","","","Blackwell Munksgaard","","","","","","09057188","","SMSSE","11985766","English","Scand.

Type of Study: One prospective serial blinded study and 1 retrospective blinded study. Methods: The first part of the study focused on MRI scans obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively in a case series of 10 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopically assisted PCL reconstruction (group A), and of 10 patients who underwent combined ACL-PCL arthroscopic reconstruction (group B). For the second part of the study, MRI scans were obtained in a retrospective series of 10 patients at mid-term follow-up after PCL arthroscopic reconstruction (group C). Signal intensity of 3 zones, corresponding to the proximal, middle, and distal intra-articular graft zones, was evaluated according to the Howell et al. classification. Fiber continuity assessment was performed using a modified Kühne et al. score. The signal intensity of the 3 zones was independently scored. Knee stability was clinically and instrumentally graded according to the IKDC evaluation form (group 4). A multivariance analysis and grouped t test were used for statistical evaluation. Results: In group A, the average MRI evaluation score was 7.65 ± 1.6 at 3 months, 3.8 ± 0.6 at 6 months, 4.75 ± 1 at 9 months and 6.25 ± 1.2 at 1 year. The portion of graft exiting the femoral tunnel exhibited increased signal and faster maturation than the tibial tunnel. In group B (combined ACL-PCL reconstruction), the graft showed slower graft healing with an average MRI score of 4.85 ± 0.7 at 3 months, 1.9 ± 0.7 at 6 months, 3.9 ± 0.9 at 9 months, and 5.3 ± 1.1 at 1 year. At 1 year follow-up, there was no correlation between MRI appearance and stability in group A, even with MRI findings of fiber continuity. However, at long-term evaluation (group C), a strict correlation between MRI appearance and achieved stability was found. Conclusions: The patellar tendon when used for PCL reconstruction requires more than 1 year to achieve a low-signal intensity over its entire course, and the distal zone near the tibial tunnel shows a slower healing process. MRI graft assessment is useful only 1 year or more following PCL reconstruction.","Arthroscopy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Posterior cruciate ligament","adolescent; adult; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone graft; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; female; follow up; healing; human; image analysis; knee instability; knee ligament; ligament surgery; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; postoperative period; school child; surgical technique; treatment outcome","","","0.2-Tesla Artroscan, Esaote; 0.3-Tesla Airis, Hitachi","Esaote; Hitachi","","","Autz, George, Magnetic resonance evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament repair using the patellar tendon double bone block technique, Skeletal Radiology, 20, 8, pp. 585-588, (1991); Howell, Stephen M., Serial magnetic resonance study assessing the effects of impingement on the MR image of the patellar tendon graft, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 3, pp. 350-358, (1992); Howell, Stephen M., Serial magnetic resonance imaging of hamstring anterior cruciate ligament autografts during the first year of implantation: A preliminary study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 1, pp. 42-47, (1991); Howell, Stephen M., Unimpinged and impinged anterior cruciate ligament grafts: MR signal intensity measurements, Radiology, 179, 3, pp. 639-643, (1991); Kühne, Jobst Henner, Magnetic resonance imaging and knee stability following ACL reconstruction, Orthopedics, 21, 1, pp. 39-43, (1998); Moeser, Phillip M., MR imaging of anterior cruciate ligament repair, Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 13, 1, pp. 105-110, (1989); Cheung, Yvonne Yee, MRI of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 16, 1, pp. 134-137, (1992); Murakami, Yuji, MR evaluation of human anterior cruciate ligament autograft on oblique axial imaging, Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 22, 2, pp. 270-275, (1998); Rak, Kevin M., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Evaluation with MR imaging, Radiology, 178, 2, pp. 553-556, (1991); Yamato, Minoru, Mri of patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament autografts, Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 16, 4, pp. 604-607, (1992)","P.P.

Fourteen male subjects submitted to intra-articular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with patellar tendon graft. All parameters improved from the 4th to the 8th month post-op. The deficits were more pronounced for the quadriceps than for the hamstrings, which regained full function at 5 months. Quadriceps performance and thigh circumference were impaired even after 8 months. According to the Lysholm Score, all subjects scored at least as good function and 54% had excellent results. There was a positive correlation between quadriceps performance and both single and triple hops (0.51-0.63), whilst for the harmstrings the correlations were weak (0.32-0.44). We conclude that: 1) Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament injury present quadriceps weakness even after 8 months of the reconstructive surgery using patellar tendon graft; 2) when an isokinetic dynamometer is not available, horizontal impulse tests can be used to evaluate quadriceps deficiency; 3) thigh circumference should not be used as a measurement to predict muscle performance; 4) the Lysholm Score is not sensitive to detect limitations in muscle performance.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; correlation analysis; evaluation; exercise test; hamstring; human; intermethod comparison; isokinetic exercise; joint mobility; knee arthroplasty; knee function; male; motor performance; muscle weakness; patella tendon; postoperative period; prediction; quadriceps femoris muscle; scoring system; tendon graft; thigh","","","","","","","Andriacchi, Thomas P., Functional testing in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 40-47, (1993); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Branch, Thomas P., Dynamic EMG analysis of anterior cruciate deficient legs with and without bracing during cutting, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 35-41, (1989); Principles and Practice of Isokinetics in Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, (1996); DeVita, Paul, Gait adaptations before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 29, 7, pp. 853-859, (1997); Frank, Cyril Basil, The science of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 79, 10, pp. 1556-1576, (1997); Glasgow, Steven G., The effect of early versus late return to vigorous activities on the outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 243-248, (1993); Hargens, Alan Robert, Fluid shifts and muscle function in humans during acute simulated weightlessness, Journal of Applied Physiology Respiratory Environmental and Exercise Physiology, 54, 4, pp. 1003-1009, (1983); Harter, Rod A., Long-term evaluation of knee stability and function following surgical reconstruction for anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 16, 5, pp. 434-443, (1988); Hiemstra, Laurie Anne, Knee strength deficits after hamstring tendo and patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 32, 8, pp. 1472-1479, (2000)","A.C.

Hypothesis: The choice of graft material (patellar tendon or hamstring tendon) does affect clinical outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial. Methods: Two groups of 90 patients each were followed for a minimum of 5 years. Results: International Knee Documentation Committee assessment revealed that more than 85% of each group had an overall score of A or B at all follow-up intervals. The median Lysholm knee score was greater than 90 for both groups at 2 and 5 years. Instrumented testing revealed no significant difference between the two groups beyond 3 years. Thirty-one percent of the patellar tendon group (25) had a fixed flexion deformity and 19% of the hamstring tendon group (14) had fixed flexion deformity at 5 years. Radiologic assessment revealed early osteoarthritic changes in 4% of the hamstring tendon group (2) and in 18% of the patellar tendon group (11) at 5 years. Conclusions: Arthroscopic reconstruction with either graft results in a similar surgical outcome, reliably restoring knee stability over a 5-year period; however, patients with patellar tendon grafts are at greater risk of developing early signs of osteoarthritis. © 2002 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; functional assessment; graft failure; hamstring; human; knee function; knee instability; knee osteoarthritis; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; priority journal; prospective study; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome; weight bearing","","","RCI, Smith and Nephew; Vicryl, Ethicon","Smith and Nephew; Ethicon","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Knee Surgery, (1994); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

There are no established methods of treatment. The objective of the current study was to report the clinical outcome of a two-stage autologous reconstruction on nine knees (eight patients). The mean followup was 40.1 months. The first stage of the reconstruction was done at a mean of 2 weeks after the injury, and the posterior cruciate ligament was reconstructed by an arthroscopically assisted technique using contralateral autogenous hamstring tendon as the graft material. Three months later, the second stage of the reconstruction was done for the ligaments that had not healed with conservative treatment. Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was done on all of the knees using the ipsilateral autogenous hamstring tendon or bone-patellar tendon-bone as the graft material. At the same time, a medial collateral ligament reconstruction using an autogenous semitendinosus tendon was done on one knee, and reconstruction of the posterolateral ligamentous structures using a biceps tendon was done on three knees. Each of the knees that was reconstructed was capable of full extension, and the mean degree of passive flexion was 139.5° ± 5.2°. The mean side-to-side difference in anteroposterior total laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer, manual maximum) was 2.3 ± 1.9 mm. None of the knees had lateral or medial instability. All of the injured ligaments were able to be reconstructed with autografts, and severe contracture was able to be prevented. A good clinical outcome can be achieved when two-stage reconstruction is used for traumatic knee dislocations.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; autograft; biceps brachii muscle; bone graft; clinical article; colloid; conservative treatment; contracture; female; hamstring; human; knee arthroscopy; knee dislocation; knee function; knee instability; knee ligament; knee ligament injury; knee surgery; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; postoperative complication; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Knee Surgery, (1994); Fanelli, Gregory C., Arthroscopically assisted combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 12, 1, pp. 5-14, (1996); Harner, Christopher Dechant, Evaluation and treatment of posterior cruciate ligament injuries, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 26, 3, pp. 471-482, (1998); Meyers, Marvin H., Traumatic dislocation of the knee joint, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 57, 3, pp. 430-433, (1975); Noyes, Frank R., Reconstruction of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments after knee dislocation.

Assessment before and at two, six, 12 and 24 months after surgery, included the history, physical examination, a modified International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the Tegner score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and instrumented laxity testing. There were no cases of reactive synovitis or of infection of the knee, and there was no difference regarding the failure rate between the two groups. The IKDC showed no significant differences between the two groups at any stage of the follow-up. The KOOS evaluation showed consistently better results in all subscales for the LARS group during the first year of follow-up. After 24 months these differences were no longer evident. Instrument-tested laxity was greater in the LARS group at all stages of follow-up, but the differences were not significant at 24 months.

Twenty patients who underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts were randomly assigned to one of the two procedures. Both groups (10 patients in each) were followed up at 1 year. Lysholm and International Knee Documentation scores and thigh circumferences were markedly reduced after surgery in both groups but improved up until the last follow-up examination at 12 months postoperatively. Clinical examination, functional scores, stabilometry measurements, and thigh circumferences did not differ between the two groups. Isokinetic evaluation revealed a significant reduction of extensor peak torques in both groups that was most pronounced at 3 months, then improved continuously but was still present 12 months postoperatively. A significant reduction of peak torques, up to 35%, was seen in the flexor muscles of the involved legs compared with the contralateral legs, but this deficit vanished completely after 12 months in both groups. At 3 and 6 months, for the flexor as well as the extensor muscles, the deficits in peak torque on the injured sides were found to have improved faster in the single-incision group. These results indicate improved dynamic muscle function with use of the single-incision technique because the dissection of the vastus lateralis muscle that occurs in the two-incision technique is avoided.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; clinical article; controlled study; documentation; extensor muscle; female; flexor muscle; human; incision; intermethod comparison; isokinetic exercise; ligament surgery; male; muscle function; patella; postoperative period; priority journal; surgical technique; tendon graft; thigh; torque; vastus lateralis muscle","","","","","","","Brandsson, Sveinbjörn, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: Comparison of outside-in and all-inside techniques, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 33, 1, pp. 42-45, (1999); Carter, Thomas R., Isokinetic evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Hamstring versus patellar tendon, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 15, 2, pp. 169-172, (1999); Engström, Björn K.O., Knee function after anterior cruciate ligament ruptures treated conservatively, International Orthopaedics, 17, 4, pp. 208-213, (1993); Fink, Christian, (Neuro)muscular changes in the knee stabilizing muscles after rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, Sportverletzung Sportschaden : Organ der Gesellschaft fur Orthopadisch-Traumatologische Sportmedizin, 8, 1, pp. 25-30, (1994); Fossier, E., Principles and value of isokinetic evaluation in ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament, Revue de Chirurgie Orthopedique et Reparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur, 79, 8, pp. 615-624, (1993); Gerich, Torsten G., Endoscopic versus limited open technique in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

All reconstructions were performed by the same surgeon, and metal interference screws were used for fixation of all grafts. No significant differences were noted between groups for Lysholm score, reduction in activity, KT-1000 arthrometer findings, quadriceps muscle size, return to sports, or ability to jump and do hard cuts and pivots. Significantly more patients in the patellar tendon group had patellofemoral pain at 6 months after surgery than did the hamstring tendon patients (48% versus 20%), and at last follow-up the incidence of patellofemoral pain was 42% and 20%, respectively. Fourteen patients in the patellar tendon group and seven in the hamstring tendon group had loss of motion (approximately 5°). Four patients (two in each group) had treatment failures and their results were not included in the clinical examination data. At 2 years' follow-up, 97% of patients with patellar tendon grafts and 100% of patients with hamstring tendon grafts rated their results as good or excellent. We found that hamstring tendon grafts performed similarly to patellar tendon grafts, although fewer patients in the hamstring tendon group had patellofemoral pain and loss of motion.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthralgia; autograft; bone screw; conference paper; female; functional assessment; gracilis muscle; human; incidence; knee arthroplasty; knee function; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; priority journal; prospective study; scoring system; semitendinous muscle; sport injury; tendon graft; treatment failure; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

Eighteen patients who had continuity of the anterior cruciate ligament but had symptomatic laxity were treated with arthroscopic electrothermal shrinkage of the anterior cruciate ligament using a monopolar radiofrequency probe. The mean length of follow-up in patients whose stability was maintained was 20.5 months. Seven of the patients had undergone previous reconstruction, four with patellar tendon graft and three with quadrupled hamstring tendon graft. Laxity was chronic in nine patients and acute in nine. The KT-1000 arthrometer results at 1 month postoperatively revealed decreased anterior excursion, with an average side-to-side difference of 1.9 mm. However, 11 patients had a failed result at an average 4.0 months. Of the seven patients with successful results, six had native ligaments and had been treated for acute laxity and one had a patellar tendon graft and had been treated for chronic laxity. Even with the short-term follow-up in our study, it is evident that thermal shrinkage using radiofrequency technology has limited application for patients with anterior cruciate ligament laxity. Although it may be useful in treating patients with an acutely injured native anterior cruciate ligament, further study is needed to see if the ligament stretches out over time or is at increased risk of reinjury.","","collagen; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; clinical article; conference paper; female; follow up; hamstring; human; hyperthermic therapy; joint laxity; knee arthroplasty; knee disease; male; patella tendon; postoperative period; priority journal; radiofrequency; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","collagen, 9007-34-5","","","","","Abelow, Steve P., Laser capsulorrhaphy for multidirectional instability of the shoulder, Operative Techniques in Sports Medicine, 5, 4, pp. 244-248, (1997); Genuine Works of Hippocrates, (1939); Boden, Barry P., Natural history of the ACL-deficient knee, Sports Medicine and Arthroscopy Review, 5, 1, pp. 20-28, (1997); Carson, Eric W., Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction., Instructional course lectures, 47, pp. 361-368, (1998); Chen, Silvia Sihui, Heat-induced changes in the mechanics of a collagenous tissue: Isothermal, isotonic shrinkage, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 120, 3, pp. 382-388, (1998); Dillingham, Michael F., Arthroscopic electrothermal surgery of the knee, Operative Techniques in Sports Medicine, 6, 3, pp. 154-156, (1998); Fanton, Gary S., Arthroscopic electrothermal surgery of the shoulder, Operative Techniques in Sports Medicine, 6, 3, pp. 139-146, (1998); Feagin, John A., Isolated tear of the anterior cruciate ligament: 5-year follow-up study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 4, 3, pp. 95-100, (1976); Garino, Jonathan P., Osteonecrosis of the knee following laser-assisted arthroscopic surgery: A report of six cases, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 4, pp. 467-474, (1995); Getelman, Mark H., Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery., The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 7, 3, pp. 189-198, (1999)","","","SAGE Publications Inc. claims@sagepub.com","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","","English","Am.

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the patellar tendon was used to determine the width of the tendon and the quality of the tissue. The section of the tendon harvested included 7 to 8 mm of the regenerated tendon and 2 to 3 mm of previously untouched tendon either medial or lateral to the healed tissue. The mean time from primary graft harvest to reharvest was 71.0 ± 44 months (range, 32 to 180). An accelerated rehabilitation program was used postoperatively. Objective follow-up of more than 2 years after surgery was available for 8 patients at a mean of 49.0 ± 15.4 months. The average range of motion in the anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knee was 6/0/133 at 1 month postoperatively and 6/0/145 at long-term follow-up. The mean manual maximum KT-1000 arthrometer difference between knees was 1.6 ± 1.2 mm. The mean isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength of the reharvested graft donor knee was 103% ± 7% of that of the opposite knee. Subjective scores were obtained from 11 patients (12 knees) at a mean of 51.5 ± 35.7 months (range, 24 to 150) after surgery; the mean score was 89.3 ± 6.9 points. We conclude that with appropriate preoperative planning, a reharvested patellar tendon can be used for revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to obtain reliable stability and strength postoperatively.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical article; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; joint stability; knee arthroplasty; knee function; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; reoperation; scoring system; tendon graft; treatment outcome; treatment planning","","","","","","","Burks, Robert T., Biomechanical and histological observations of the dog patellar tendon after removal of its central one-third, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 2, pp. 146-153, (1990); Colosimo, Angelo J., Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a reharvested ipsilateral patellar tendon, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 29, 6, pp. 746-750, (2001); Coupens, Steven D., Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the patellar tendon after use of its central one-third for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 3, pp. 332-335, (1992); Karns, Daniel J., Case report: Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 10, 2, pp. 148-151, (1994); Kartus, Jüri Toomas, Ipsi- or contralateral patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament revision surgery.

Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) by transtibial technique with free graft from the patellar tendon fixed by interference screws is a commonly used procedure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results 5 to 6 years after the surgery. Material. Fifty-two of 79 patients operated on in 1995 were checked in the period of 2000-2001. The average age of patients at the time of surgery was 26 years (range, 15-20 years), there were more men (62 %), prevailing were injuries resulting from sports activities (92%). Method. We have used evaluation according to IKDC. We focused on the problems at the site from which the graft was harvested, on the difficulties in the kneeling position and walking on knees. Evaluation of the activity was based on the Tegner score. On radiographs we assessed the length of the patellar tendon, dilatation of the tibial canal and the incidence and degree of osteoarthritis. Results: General evaluation according to IKDC was normal or nearly normal in 79 % of patients. The difference of the anterior displacement of tibia between the operated on and non-operated on knee measured by arthrometer (KT 1000, 89N) was < 3 mm in 58 % of patients and ≤ 5 mm in 95 % of patients. Significant difficulties on the operated on side in the kneeling position and walking on knees were reported by 3 patients, slight difficulties were reported by 28 patients. Twenty patients reported slight difficulties also on the non-operated on side. Prior to the injury the average level of activity after Tegner was 7,9 (range, 6-10), prior to the operation 2,7 (range, 0-6) and at the time of check examination 7,0 (range, 4-10). The same level of activity as before the injury was reported by 61,5 % of patients. Shortening of the patellar tendon on the operated on side > 5 % (6 mm) was found out in 1 patient, shortening of ≤ 5 % (2-3 mm) in 30 patients. Tibial canal on the lateral projection 1 cm beneath the joint line was wider than 10 mm (dilated) in 6 patients. On the operated on knee osteoarthritis was found of the medial compartment of degree B and C in 42 % of patients and on the non-operated knee in 19 % patients. Aggravation of osteoarthritis of the medial compartment by one degree occurred after 5 to 6 years after the surgery in 4 out of 20 patients. All of them underwent meniscectomy. Eighty-six per cent (19 of 22) of patients with osteoarthritis of the medial compartment underwent medial meniscectomy. Discussion. General results according to IKDC are compared with results published by Aglietti, Jomha and Patel. Dilatation of the tibial canal was found out in 6 patients and it was associated with the graft-tunnel mismatch. The relationship between meniscectomy and arthritis is well-know. In 31 % of patients after medial meniscectomy there was found out narrowing of the joint line to 2-4 mm (degree C). In case of partial medial meniscectomy the posterior horn, i.e. the most important part of the meniscus, was in most cases removed. Worsening of the arthritis after resection of the minor radial lesions of the lateral meniscus or after leaving incomplete lesions of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus untreated has not been observed. Conclusion. The surgery allows to improve the stability and extent of activity in most of the patients. The most frequent problem consists in the difficulties at the site of graft harvesting which may contribute to the decrease of subjective satisfaction. The relation between shortening of the patellar tendon and patellar difficulties was not proved. In the patients after medial meniscectomy osteoarthritis progresses even after ACL reconstruction.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Ligament reconstruction; Patellar tendon graft","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease exacerbation; disease severity; female; frequency analysis; human; human tissue; incidence; knee function; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; meniscectomy; outcomes research; patella tendon; patient satisfaction; physical activity; scoring system; sport injury; statistical analysis; surgical technique; tendon graft; tibia; adolescent; arthroscopy; follow up; injury; patella ligament; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Patellar Ligament","","","KT 1000","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison between medial meniscus repair, partial meniscectomy, and normal meniscus in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 307, pp. 165-173, (1994); Blackburn, J.

This study aimed to quantify blood loss with and without notchplasty after arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts. We performed a prospective clinical study of 58 patients, who had undergone arthroscopically assisted autogenous patellar tendon ACL reconstruction. In group I, a notchplasty was necessary according to the local anatomical criteria (intraoperative impingement test). In group II, ACL replacement could be performed without notchplasty. Single and total day drainage volume, serum and suction drain hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels were monitored. One year after surgery, the patients were reviewed to assess the outcome according to the IKDC and Lysholm scores and the KT-1000 arthrometer. The total drainage volume was 448 ml (range 150-550 ml) in group I and 299 ml (range 50-420 ml) in group II (p < 0.001). The serum hematocrit (Hct) decrease was 9.7% in group I and 7.4% in group II (p < 0.001). At 12 months after surgery, the IKDC and Lysholm score evaluations and the KT-1000 arthrometer measurements revealed no clinical differences between the notchplasty and non-notchplasty groups. Despite a 30% increase in blood loss, notchplasty has been shown to be a useful procedure to prevent graft impingement without negative side-effects.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Blood loss; Bone-patellar tendon-bone; Notchplasty","hemoglobin; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bleeding; blood level; blood volume; bone graft; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; hematocrit; human; human tissue; knee arthroscopy; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; measurement; monitoring; patella tendon; peroperative care; plastic surgery; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; prospective study; scoring system; suction drainage; surgical anatomy; surgical technique; tendon graft; tibia; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Blood Loss, Surgical; Collateral Ligaments; Female; Hematocrit; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Orthopedic Procedures; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rupture; Suction; Treatment Outcome","","","KT-1000 arthrometer","","","","Norwood, Lyle A., Anterior cruciate ligament: Functional anatomy of its bundles in rotatory instabilities, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 7, 1, pp. 23-26, (1979); Norwood, Lyle A., The intercondylar shelf and the anterior cruciate ligament, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 5, 4, pp. 171-176, (1977); Tanzer, Michael, The relationship of intercondylar notch size and content to notchplasty requirement in anterior cruciate ligament surgery, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 6, 2, pp. 89-93, (1990); Yaru, Nicholas C., The effect of tibial attachment site on graft impingement in an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 217-220, (1992); Howell, Stephen M., Arthroscopic roofplasty: A method for correcting an extension deficit caused by roof impingement of an anterior cruciate ligament graft, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 3, pp. 375-379, (1992); Berg, Eugene E., Assessing arthroscopic notchplasty, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 7, 3, pp. 275-277, (1991); Morgan, Eric A., The effect of intercondylar notchplasty on the patellofemoral articulation, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 24, 6, pp. 843-846, (1996); Mann, Thomas A., The natural history of the intercondylar notch after notchplasty, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 2, pp. 181-188, (1999); LaPrade, R.

The use of the hamstring tendon as a graft could reduce these detrimental effects, related to the extensor muscle. The purpose of our study was to evaluate hamstring muscle power after ACL reconstruction at 3 and 24 months following surgery. Twenty-five patients were evaluated clinically with isokinetic testing, using the LIDO isokinetic dynamometer. IKDC and KT 2000 were used for clinical assessment of anterior tibial displacement. An aggressive rehabilitation protocol with resumption of sport after 3 or 4 months of recovery was used in all patients. The results of IKDC and KT 2000 were highly satisfactory at both testing stages. Isokinetic tests showed at 3 months ah 11% deficit for extensor muscles and an 18% deficit for flexor muscles of the post-operative leg. At two years the power of the extensor muscle was greater or the same as that on the non-operative-side, while flexor muscle power remained reduced at least 10%. Extensor power values after 3 months are similar to those observed on a long term follow-up for patellar tendon reconstruction. The flexor muscle deficit noted at 3 months is absent at 2 years and function completely restored at this time. This suggests hamstring ACL reconstruction guarantees a fast functional recovery for the extensor and flexor muscle function and compares well with patellar tendon procedures. ©2001, Editrice Kurtis.","ACL; Hamstrings; Isokinetic; Muscle performance","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; controlled study; convalescence; device; dynamometry; evaluation; female; follow up; functional assessment; hamstring; human; Italy; knee function; ligament surgery; machine; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; muscle training; patella tendon; priority journal; sport; tendon graft; tibia","","","Lido dynamometer, Davis","Davis","","","Shelbourne, K.

This is a case series type of study. We reviewed 131 arthroscopically ACL reconstructions, with a long-term follow-up of 7.1 years. All patients were reviewed using the IKDC score, full weight-bearing, bilateral X-rays, Kt-1000 evaluation. At the follow-up we obtained 47% A, 40% B, 11% C and 2% D overall IKDC scores. Analyzing the Kt-1000 evaluation we had good-excellent results in 87.4% of the one-incision group and 83.9% in the two incision group. At follow-up we also tested lower limb motor control in 77 patients using a mobile platform. We obtained excellent result for 91% in the bipodalic static test, 91% in the right static test, 93% in the left static test, and 62% in the bilateral dynamic test. Subjectively, 123 of the 126 (97.6%) patients stated that they were satisfied with the surgical reconstruction. Unsatisfactory cases did not show significant errors or mismatched tunnels at the X-ray evaluation. The fair and poor results were due to anterior knee pain and clinical laxity. We think that they might derive in part from errors when tensioning the graft or biological problems, that consist in loosening of ligamentization of the graft. The ACL reconstructed knee showed good results and a good lower limb motor control. A precise technique and an accelerated rehabilitation program is mandatory in ACL arthroscopically assisted reconstruction. ©2001, Editrice Kurtis.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Long-term follow-up; Patellar tendon","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopy; article; endoscopic surgery; female; follow up; human; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; motor control; patella tendon; priority journal; satisfaction; sport injury; synovectomy; weight bearing","","","","","","","Jones, K.

A patellar tendon ACL reconstruction was performed in 141 patients with inside-out (group I, n=78) and outside-in technique (group II, n=63). Clinical results were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form; radiographic study was performed in anteroposterior, lateral, and notch views. Overall results in group I were normal in 23% of cases, nearly normal in 55%, and abnormal in 22%; in group II there were normal results in 19% of cases, nearly normal in 57%, abnormal in 19%, and severely abnormal in 5%. Radiographic examination identified important differences between the two groups. The main differences between the two surgical techniques were related to the positioning of the femoral tunnel. With the inside-out technique the femoral tunnel was significantly more vertical, both in the frontal and the sagittal planes. Moreover, the femoral tunnel was higher when drilled from the inside, but the difference between the two techniques was not statistically significant. The differences found between the two techniques regarding the tibial tunnel were not significant, although in the inside-out group the tibial tunnel seemed slightly more lateral, vertical, and posterior. Moreover, we observed a greater risk of bone-screw divergence on the femur in the inside-out group. This divergence was greatest in the sagittal plane. However, we observed no effect of this bone-screw divergence on the stability of the knee at follow-up.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Clinical results; Patellar tendon; Radiographic evaluation; Reconstruction technique","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; comparative study; female; follow up; human; injury; knee injury; male; methodology; orthopedic surgery; plastic surgery; prospective study; radiography; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures","","","","","","","Merrill S Atlas of Radiographic Positions and Radiologic Procedures, (1986); Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison of clinical and radiological parameters with two arthroscopic techniques for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 1, pp. 2-8, (1995); Almekinders, Louis C., Post-operative problems following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 2, pp. 78-82, (1995); Amiel, David A., Tendons and ligaments: A morphological and biochemical comparison, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 1, 3, pp. 257-265, (1983); Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Amis, Andrew Arthur, Proceedings of the ESSKA Scientific Workshop on Reconstruction of the Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligaments, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 2, 3, pp. 124-132, (1994); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament using a patellar tendon allograft.

Methods: The original study group included prospectively 58 patients who underwent arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction with BPTB graft in a two-tunnel technique between 1991 and 1993. Seven patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 51 patients for a first follow-up at 6 months and a second follow-up at 3-6 years (mean 4.3 years). Clinical results were evaluated by means of the Lysholm score and the IKDC score. Laxity was assessed using a KT-1000 arthrometer applying an 89 N anterior load in 20° of flexion. Increased laxity was defined as a 3 mm increase in AP translation between the first and the second follow-up. Results: At mid-term follow-up pivot shift was negative in 86% of cases. IKDC score: normal=28%, nearly normal=44%, abnormal=24%, severely abnormal=4%. KT-1000: <3 mm=68%, 3-5 mm=24%, >5 mm=8%. The mean KT-1000 side-to-side difference was 1.08 (0.17) mm at 6 months and 2.01 (0.29) mm at 3-6 years. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.005). According to the defined criteria, seven patients had increased laxity at the second follow-up, suggesting a malfunction of the graft due to stretch-out or injury. In this subgroup the mean KT-1000 measurements were 0.86 (0.26) mm at the first follow-up and 5.93 (0.54) mm at the second follow-up. In five of these patients, a malposition of the tunnels was identified as a possible cause. In the remaining group, KT-1000 measurements did not differ significantly between the first and the second follow-up [1.12 (0.20) mm versus 1.37 (0.21) mm]. Conclusions: Increase in AP laxity occurred in 14% of our cases between the first and the second follow-up. In most of these cases increased laxity was due to inadequate surgical technique, especially malposition of bony tunnels. If tunnel position was correct, there was no evidence for elongation of grafts over time as a general principle.","Anterior cruciate ligament; BPTB graft; Follow-up; KT-1000; Surgery","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; plastic surgery; prospective study; rupture; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Rupture; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Abe, Shuji, Light and electron microscopic study of remodeling and maturation process in autogenous graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 9, 4, pp. 394-405, (1993); Alm, Anders, Transposed medial third of patellar ligament in reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Radiol., Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt am Main, Hessen, Germany, ","We analyzed prospectively the diagnostic efficacy of contrast-enhanced MRI following anterior cruciate neoligament (ACL) reconstruction. One hundred fifty-six MR examinations were performed 2, 12, 52, 76, and 104 weeks post-operatively on 68 patients with ACL transplants. Sagittal, parasagittal, and coronal images using unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted spinecho sequences, and post-contrast images utilizing T1-weighted spinecho and fat-saturated sequences, were acquired. Results were correlated with those of the pivot shift, Lachman, and a mechanical test. The MR examination criteria included morphological analysis, signal intensity, transplant contrast enhancement, secondary signs (e.g., elongation of normal ligaments), and comparison with clinically standardized test results. Two weeks post-operatively all neoligaments showed homogeneous low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted spinecho sequences indistinguishable from that of normal cruciate or patellar ligaments [contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) on T1: 1.6], with a 9% percentile enhancement. At 12-52 weeks, signal intensity increased (C/N: 6.7), with a mean 50% percentile enhancement. The 1-year follow-up allowed no definite assessment of the neoligament's course. At 76 and 104 weeks, significant decrements in signal intensity (C/N: 3.0) and ligamentous percentile enhancement (25%) occurred. All patients tested displayed stable transplants 2 years post-operatively. Contrast-enhanced MRI allows accurate evaluation of morphology and function up to 3 months post-operatively and 1-2 years following ACL reconstructive surgery.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Gadolinium contrast enhancement; Knee injuries; MR imaging","contrast medium; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical trial; contrast enhancement; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; female; follow up; human; image reconstruction; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; morphology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; signal noise ratio; surgical technique; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Contrast Media; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gadolinium DTPA; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Prospective Studies","","Contrast Media, 0; Gadolinium DTPA, 80529-93-7","","","","","Rak, Kevin M., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Evaluation with MR imaging, Radiology, 178, 2, pp. 553-556, (1991); Larsen, Lars P.S., Diagnosis of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee by sonography, European Journal of Ultrasound, 12, 2, pp. 163-167, (2000); Schwarz, Winfried, Manual sonometry of the knee.

Forty-six patients (37 male, 9 female, mean age, 33.6 ± 8.0 years) who underwent open ACL reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft and 25 patients (18 male, 7 female, mean age, 32.3 ± 9.9 years) who were treated nonoperatively were evaluated by the same two examiners at 5-7 and 10-13 years following injury. The evaluations included objective and subjective scoring (Lysholm, OAK, IKDC), instrumented testing (Cybex, KT 1000), radiographic evaluation, and assessments of sports activity, with respect to type, frequency and associated symptoms. According to Lysholm, OAK and IKDC scores, the operative group performed significantly (p < 0.05) better and was able to maintain increased involvement in sports, although both groups participated less over time. However, risks for degenerative joint changes were similar for both the operative and the nonoperative group. A significant (p < 0.05) correlation between participation in high-risk pivoting sports, such as soccer or basketball and osteoarthritic changes could be found for the nonoperative group, only. Sports activity represents an important variable not only affecting the outcome, but also influencing treatment decisions following ACL injuries.","Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Outcome; Sports activity; Treatment decision","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; conservative treatment; correlation function; female; human; instrumentation; major clinical study; male; osteoarthritis; patella tendon; scoring system; sport; tendon graft; treatment outcome; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Athletic Injuries; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Selection; Rupture; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","","","Cybex II+, Lumex; KT 1000","Lumex","","","Casteleyn, Pierre Paul, Management of anterior cruciate ligament lesions: Surgical fashion, personal whim or scientific evidence?

The arthroscopic procedure with single incision was hypothesized to improve proprioception and to provide earlier rehabilitation. Twenty-nine patients with chronic ACL-deficiency were included in the prospective study. Fifteen patients were operated endoscopically, 14 patients using the two-tunnel technique. Proprioception, Lysholm and Tegner scores as well as stability (KT-1000) were assessed preoperatively, 3 and 6 months postoperatively as well as after 3.9±0.4 years. A significant deficit of proprioception was assessed in both groups preoperatively. Six months postoperatively, both groups showed a restitution of proprioception near full extension and full flexion of the knee. In the mid-range position, the proprioception could not be restored. At the final examination after 3.9 years, the deficit documented in the mid-range position still persisted.

Type of Study: Prospective study of ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone in an acute population. Methods: From October 1991 through June 1997, 1,015 patients underwent ACL reconstruction, 769 with bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts; 235 met the criteria for this study. All chronic injuries, failed and/or bilateral reconstructions were excluded making the total population 139. The final populations included 115 patients in a non-WC group and 24 patients in a WC group. Average follow-up for was 34.5 months for the WC group and 33.6 months for the non-WC group. All patients had equal objective evaluations, which allowed the subjective criteria to be analyzed. Results: The results revealed a significant difference in the subjective data of patients with WC benefits. Uniformly, WC patients rated subjective criteria as far worse than the non-WC group in postoperative stages. The average of the 15-item visual analog scale showed statistically significant (P < .01) differences between the WC and non-WC groups. Average postoperative Tegner scores were 3.05 for the WC group and 6.02 for the non-WC group, which was statistically significant. The WC group did not return to their preinjury Tegner score. Conclusions: The data show that the patients' perception of their knee function drastically differs from the objective findings on examination; therefore, it should be anticipated that the WC patient might have lower subjective outcomes from surgical treatment when compared with their non-WC counterparts.","ACL reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Knee surgery; Patellar tendon autograft; Workers' compensation","","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Arthroscopy Association of North America Specialty Day Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, (1998); Misamore, Gary W., Repair of the rotator cuff: A comparison of results in two populations of patients, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 77, 9, pp. 1335-1339, (1995); Bray, Robert Charles, Arthroscopic lateral release for anterior knee pain: A study comparing patients who are claiming worker's compensation with those who are not, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 237-247, (1987); Noyes, Frank R., A comparison of results of arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between workers' compensation and noncompensation patients, Arthroscopy, 13, 4, pp. 474-484, (1997); Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); Tegner, Yelverton, Rating systems in the evaluation of knee ligament injuries, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 198, pp. 43-49, (1985); Kelly, Anne-Maree Maree, Patient satisfaction with pain management does not correlate with initial or discharge VAS pain score, verbal pain rating at discharge, or change in VAS score in the emergency department, Journal of Emergency Medicine, 19, 2, pp. 113-116, (2000); Beck, Charles L., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the endoscopic technique, Operative Techniques in Orthopaedics, 2, 2, pp. 86-98, (1992); Diment, Michael T., Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a central-third patellar tendon autograft and two incisions, Operative Techniques in Sports Medicine, 1, 1, pp. 45-49, (1993)","G.R.

We used computed tomography (CT) sequentially to monitor the time course of these changes over a 2-year period and correlated the results to clinical outcome and instrumented laxity measurements. Type of Study: Case series. Methods: Thirty-four patients (11 women, 23 men; mean age, 26.4 ± 4.5 years) who underwent endoscopic patellar tendon ACL reconstruction, were evaluated clinically according to IKDC, Lysholm, and Tegner scores as well as with respect to changes in tibial tunnel morphology over a 2-year period. Subsequent CT scans were performed at 1 and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The tibial bone tunnel was measured in the sagittal and coronal planes at 5 different levels (L1 to L5). Results: The diameters of the tibial tunnel increased an average overall by 30.6% in the sagittal plane and 16.4% in the coronal plane within 2 years. The enlargement was significantly higher (P < .05) in the mid portion of the tunnel (L 2/3: 44.0% and 47.9% in the sagittal and 29.8% and 29.9% in the coronal plane, respectively), which resulted in a uniform cavity-type appearance. The percentage of change in tunnel size was significantly higher (P < .05) within the first 6 weeks following surgery compared with all other time intervals. No correlation between the amount of tunnel enlargement and the clinical results or between tunnel enlargement and KT-1000 measurements could be detected. Conclusions: Endoscopic ACL reconstruction is associated with tibial tunnel enlargement, which is already present within weeks following surgery. However, no negative effects on the clinical results were found over a 24-month period in our study population.","ACL reconstruction; Patellar tendon; Tibial tunnel enlargement","","","","","","","","Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

C., Roseville Orthopedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, CA, United States","In order to determine if recent changes in tunnel placement during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction are producing better outcomes, the results of three different ""bone-patellar tendon-bone"" anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques were compared. These techniques were: two-incision with the tibial tunnel at the anterior ""footprint"" of the anterior cruciate ligament (group I), two-incision with freehand placement of the tibial tunnel in the central or posterior ""footprint"" (group II), and endoscopic single incision utilizing a guide keying on the posterior cruciate ligament to achieve posterior tibial tunnel location (group III). The femoral tunnel was established with a rear-entry guide for the two-incision techniques. A guide keying off the posterior intercondylar shelf or roof was used for femoral tunnel placement with the endoscopic technique. Subjective rating, Lysholm scores, range of motion, manual and instrumented laxity, and radiographic tibial and femoral tunnel location in the sagittal plane were studied for 33 patients (twelve in group I, nine in group II, twelve in group III) at minimum follow-up of two years. Patients had uniform rehabilitation programs. Statistically significant differences were found between the groups for a number of the variables: the mean maximum manual KT-1000 score was 3.7 millimeters for group I compared to 1.4 millimeters for group III; the mean flexion deficit was 0.5 degrees for group I and 8.3 degrees for group III; tibial tunnels were located 31% posteriorly along the sagittal tibial articular length for group I, while groups II and III were 38% and 43% respectively. Femoral tunnels for groups I and II were located 83% and 79% posteriorly along Blumensaat's line respectively, where as the mean for group III was 69%. Recent techniques (group III) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction successfully achieved ""posterior"" tibial tunnel placement. This was associated with superior results as judged by instrumented laxity measurements. The significance of the endoscopic technique's anterior femoral tunnel location relative to that of the two-incision techniques is uncertain but warrants further study.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; comparative study; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; plastic surgery; retrospective study; rupture; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Rupture; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15415457","","","11813947","English","Iowa Orthop J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035747417"

Type of Study: A retrospective investigation. Methods: Seventy-two patients who did not have previous knee surgery or surgery of the contralateral knee were re-examined 5 to 9 years after the primary ACL reconstruction. The clinical assessment was made using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation system, and the Lysholm and the Marshall knee scores. Also, radiographic evaluation and isokinetic strength testing were performed. There were 34 patients (25 men and 9 women) with an isolated ACL tear (group A), and 38 patients (23 men and 15 women) with an ACL tear and accompanying injuries (group B). The mean age was 29 years (SD 9; range, 15 to 49 years) in group A, and 34 years (SD 12; range, 15 to 61 years) in group B. Bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft with mini-arthrotomy technique and screw fixation was used in all patients. Postoperative rehabilitation was also similar in both groups. In group B, 10 medial and 12 lateral (partial or subtotal) arthroscopic meniscectomies were performed at the same time as the ACL reconstruction. Also, 18 of the 19 medial collateral ligament ruptures, the 2 lateral collateral ligament ruptures, and the 1 posterior cruciate ligament rupture were treated surgically at this operation. Results: Subjectively (overall assessment, pain, swelling, and giving way of the knee) and objectively (range of motion, stability, crepitation, isokinetic strength testing, and radiological changes of the knee), the groups did not have any significant differences in the 5- to 9-year results. Also, the final evaluation results using the IKDC and the Lysholm and the Marshall knee scores were similar in both groups. However, there were significantly more subsequent knee surgeries in the injured knee in group B than in group A. Conclusions: Our results show no large differences between patients with an isolated ACL tear and those with an ACL tear with accompanying injuries 5 to 9 years after an ACL reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. Tibiofemoral osteoarthritis was quite rare, and this may be partly attributable to the fact that the ACL reconstructions were successful, so that all the knees were stable at the re-examination. However, the future will show the final outcome for the patients.","Accompanying injuries; Anterior cruciate ligament; Isolated tear; Reconstruction","adolescent; adult; anamnesis; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone screw; clinical examination; clinical feature; controlled study; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; isokinetic exercise; joint stability; knee radiography; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; meniscectomy; muscle strength; osteoarthritis; postoperative care; rehabilitation medicine; retrospective study; scoring system; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Fu, Freddie H., Anterior cruciate ligament surgery 1996: State of the art?, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 325, pp. 19-24, (1996); Järvinen, Markku J., Reconstruction of chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency in athletes using a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft - A two-year follow up study, International Orthopaedics, 19, 1, pp. 1-6, (1995); Arangio, George A., Incidence of associated knee lesions with torn anterior cruciate ligament: Retrospective cohort assessment, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 7, 1, pp. 1-8, (1998); Maletius, Wolfgang, Eighteen- to twenty-four-year follow-up after complete rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 27, 6, pp. 711-717, (1999); Asahina, Shintaro, Intermediate-term results of meniscal repair in anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knees, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 26, 5, pp. 688-691, (1998); Barber, Frank Alan, Meniscus repair rehabilitation with concurrent anterior cruciate reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 13, 4, pp. 433-437, (1997); Barrett, Gene R., Preliminary results of the T-fix endoscopic meniscus repair technique in an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction population, Arthroscopy, 13, 2, pp. 218-223, (1997); Schmitz, Miguel A., The management of meniscal tears in the ACL-deficient knee, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 573-593, (1996); Aagaard, Henrik, Function of the normal meniscus and consequences of meniscal resection, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, 9, 3, pp. 134-140, (1999); Burks, Robert T., Fifteen-year follow-up of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, Arthroscopy, 13, 6, pp. 673-679, (1997)","T.

Results: At final IKDC evaluation, 3 patients (20%) were graded A, 7 (46.7%) were graded B, 3 (20%) were graded C, and 1 patient (6.7%) was graded D. One patient underwent revision surgery in another hospital for severe postoperative residual laxity. Two C-graded patients had an unsatisfactory outcome as a result of serious complications related to knee injuries. All patients with a grade A or B returned to sports activity. At stress view examination, mean posterior side-to-side translation measured at the lateral tibial plateau was 5.8 ± 1.1 mm and the mean translation at the medial tibial plateau was 7.3 ± 1.5 mm; the mean anterior dislocation was 3.3 ± 0.4 mm. The preoperative HSS score rated an average of 32 ± 9. Postoperatively, the average score reached was 89.6 ± 8.3. The preoperative Lysholm score was 65.5 ± 9.1 (range, 48 to 78) in patients with chronic lesions and at follow-up was 95.1 ± 4.5 (range, 88 to 100). The average Tegner activity score decreased in patients with chronic lesions from 6.9 ± 1.7 (range, 4 to 9) before injury to 5.5 ± 1.6 (range, 2 to 9) at follow-up (P = .053). At follow-up, 7 patients (50%) returned to their preinjury level after surgery. Conclusions: These results show the effectiveness and safety of simultaneous arthroscopic reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments using autografts that can adequately restore satisfactory stability, even in the presence of minimal peripheral laxity (1° or 2°). We conclude that the use of autografts can restore ligament function with good patient compliance and without significant surgical complications.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Knee dislocation; Posterior cruciate ligament","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; clinical article; female; human; knee dislocation; knee instability; knee ligament; knee ligament injury; ligament surgery; male; postoperative complication; rating scale; rehabilitation medicine; surgical technique; tendon graft","","","","","","","Fanelli, Gregory C., Arthroscopically assisted combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 12, 1, pp. 5-14, (1996); Noyes, Frank R., Reconstruction of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments after knee dislocation.

Type of Study: Double-blind prospective study. Methods: Fifty-five patients were prospectively evaluated at 2-year follow-up. In group A, 24 patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with bone -patellar tendon - bone and interference screw fixation. In group B, 31 patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with bone - patellar tendon - bone and transcondylar screw fixation. Patients were evaluated by using the IKDC form, Lysholm-II form, Tegner scoring system, and KT-2000 arthrometer. Results: In group A, final IKDC clinical evaluation achieved 0% grade A, 62.5% grade B, 25% grade C, and 12.5% grade D. In group B, 29.1% achieved grade A, 54.8% grade B, 12.9% grade C, and 3.2% grade D. The difference was statistically significant (P < .05). The injured versus normal side-to-side KT-2000 difference at maximum manual loading was 3.68 mm (SD, 1.71) in group A and 1.64 (SD, 2.05) in group B (P < .0001). Conclusions: This prospective study could not provide significant data suggesting that 1 method of fixation is superior to the other. Therefore, we consider both methods comparable in terms of stability and functional outcome at short-term follow-up. Transcondylar fixation offers the following advantages: fixation without intra-articular hardware, greater bone-to-bone fixation, and the possibility of fixation with breakage of the posterior femoral tunnel wall. Moreover, this method may be a useful alternative in revision ACL surgery.","ACL reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Fixation; Knee","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; follow up; human; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; outcomes research; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; surgical technique","","","","","","","Matthews, Leslie S., Pitfalls in the use of interference screws for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Brief report, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 5, 3, pp. 225-226, (1989); Am J Knee Surg, (1989); Berg, Eugene E., Autograft bone-patella tendon-bone plug comminution with loss of ligament fixation and stability, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 12, 2, pp. 232-235, (1996); Doerr, A.

Fifteen patients underwent operative reconstruction with hamstring tendons with wide open physes and 6 patients with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB). All grafts were anatomically placed through transphyseal bone tunnels in the femur and tibia. Nineteen of 20 patients (20 of 21 reconstructions) returned for follow-up at an average of 34 months (range: 17-89 months). All patients had reached skeletal maturity at follow-up. No patient had limb-length discrepancy >1 cm postoperatively. No change in tibiofemoral alignment was noted (average 4.5 versus 4.25, P=.69). Modified Lysholm score was 93/95, and 19 of 20 athletes returned to preinjury level sports activity. Ligament laxity side-to-side difference was <3 mm in 16 patients, 3-6 mm in 2 patients, and >6 mm in 2 patients. One patient developed recurrent symptomatic laxity and was lost to follow-up. Two late graft ruptures (1 hamstring and 1 BPTB graft) occurred after major reinjury during sports. In this group of patients, ACL reconstruction through bone tunnels successfully eliminated instability although the failure rate, including late graft ruptures, was higher than that usually reported for adults. No limb length or angular deformity developed as a result of the transphyseal tunnels.","","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; child; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee meniscus; male; methodology; plastic surgery; postoperative complication; questionnaire; skeletal muscle; sport injury; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Athletic Injuries; Child; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Muscle, Skeletal; Postoperative Complications; Questionnaires; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","08997403","","","11703036","English","Am J Knee Surg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035464453"

The prospective study included 107 randomized patients (50 BTB and 57 ST). The follow-up period was set to 20-35 weeks postoperatively (mean 26.8±3.5 weeks). One patient suffered early graft rupture and 89 (84%) of the remaining 106 patients were able to attend the follow-up within the given time limit. There were no differences in sick leave between the groups. The Lysholm score, Tegner activity level score and Visual Analog Scales (VAS) with the questions ""How does your knee function?"" and ""How does your knee affect your activity level?"" revealed no differences between the groups. Subjective patellofemoral pain, patellofemoral compartment findings and donor site morbidity were more common in the BTB group, P<0.05. Lachman test grade 1+ was more common in the ST group, P<0.05, but there was no significant difference in instrumented Lachman side-to-side comparison. The ST group scored better in the one-leg hop test than the BTB group, P<0.05. No correlations between these clinical and functional findings and subjective knee function scores were found. In conclusion, ACL reconstruction with ST tendon graft presented fewer short-term postoperative problems as compared to reconstruction with BTB.","ACL reconstruction; Anterior knee pain; Early morbidity; One-leg hop; Patellar tendon; Semitendinosus tendon; Sick leave; Visual analog scale","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; injury; joint instability; male; medical leave; middle aged; patella; postoperative complication; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Sick Leave; Tendons","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Anderson, Allen F., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons Augmented by the Losee Iliotibial Band Tenodesis: A Long-term Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 620-626, (1994); Barrett, Gene R., Endobutton button endoscopie fixation technique in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 3, pp. 340-343, (1995); Brown, Charles H., The use of hamstring tendons for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Technique and results, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 12, 4, pp. 723-756, (1993); Corry, Ian S., Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Fifty patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The patients in Group A wore a brace for three weeks post-operatively, while the patients in Group B were rehabilitated without the use of a brace. Pre-operatively, the groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, activity level, knee laxity and muscle strength. The follow-up examination was performed by one independent observer. All the patients were followed up for a minimum of two years. At the follow-up, there were no significant differences between the study groups in terms of the Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, IKDC evaluation system, one-leg-hop quotient, KT-1000 measurements and isokinetic torque. Using the visual analogue scale, the patients in Group A evaluated their pain during the first two post-operative weeks as 1.0 (0-7), compared with 2.3 (0-9) in Group B (P= 0.04). Furthermore, the patients in Group A had a tendency towards fewer problems with swelling, haemathrosis and wound leakage during the early post-operative period (P= 0.08). We conclude that the patients who were rehabilitated with the use of a brace had less pain and a tendency towards fewer complications during the early post-operative period than the patients who were rehabilitated without the use of a brace.

We used computed tomography (CT) sequentially to monitor the time course of these changes over a 2-year period and correlated the results to clinical outcome and instrumented laxity measurements. Type of Study: Case series. Methods: Thirty-four patients (11 women, 23 men; mean age, 26.4 ± 4.5 years) who underwent endoscopic patellar tendon ACL reconstruction, were evaluated clinically according to IKDC, Lysholm, and Tegner scores as well as with respect to changes in tibial tunnel morphology over a 2-year period. Subsequent CT scans were performed at 1 and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The tibial bone tunnel was measured in the sagittal and coronal planes at 5 different levels (L1 to L5). Results: The diameters of the tibial tunnel increased an average overall by 30.6% in the sagittal plane and 16.4% in the coronal plane within 2 years. The enlargement was significantly higher (P < .05) in the mid portion of the tunnel (L 2/3: 44.0% and 47.9% in the sagittal and 29.8% and 29.9% in the coronal plane, respectively), which resulted in a uniform cavity-type appearance. The percentage of change in tunnel size was significantly higher (P < .05) within the first 6 weeks following surgery compared with all other time intervals. No correlation between the amount of tunnel enlargement and the clinical results or between tunnel enlargement and KT-1000 measurements could be detected. Conclusions: Endoscopic ACL reconstruction is associated with tibial tunnel enlargement, which is already present within weeks following surgery. However, no negative effects on the clinical results were found over a 24-month period in our study population.","ACL reconstruction; Patellar tendon; Tibial tunnel enlargement","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; correlation analysis; endoscopic surgery; female; follow up; human; ligament surgery; male; postoperative complication; scoring system; surgical approach; surgical technique; tibia; time series analysis; treatment outcome","","","HiSpeed CT/I, GE Medical Systems","GE Medical Systems","","","Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

Type of Study: Prospective study of ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone in an acute population. Methods: From October 1991 through June 1997, 1,015 patients underwent ACL reconstruction, 769 with bone-patellar cendon-bone autografts; 235 met the criteria for this study. All chronic injuries, failed and/or bilateral reconstructions were excluded making the total population 139. The final populations included 115 patients in a non-WC group and 24 patients in a WC group. Average follow-up for was 34.5 months for the WC group and 33.6 months for the non-WC group. All patients had equal objective evaluations, which allowed the subjective criteria to be analyzed. Results: The results revealed a significant difference in the subjective data of patients with WC benefits. Uniformly, WC patients rated subjective criteria as far worse than the non-WC group in postoperative stages. The average of the 15-item visual analog scale showed statistically significant (P < .01) differences between the WC and non-WC groups. Average postoperative Tegner scores were 3.05 for the WC group and 6.012 for the non-WC group, which was statistically significant. The WC group did not return to their preinjury Tegner score. Conclusions: The data show that the patients' perception of their knee function drastically differs from the objective findings on examination; therefore, it should be anticipated that the WC patient might have lower subjective outcomes from surgical treatment when compared with their non-WC counterparts.","ACL reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Knee surgery; Patellar tendon autograft; Workers' Compensation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; female; follow up; human; knee function; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; outcomes research; patella tendon; patient satisfaction; postoperative complication; scoring system; treatment failure; workman compensation","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Arthroscopy Association of North America Specialty Day Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, (1998); Misamore, Gary W., Repair of the rotator cuff: A comparison of results in two populations of patients, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 77, 9, pp. 1335-1339, (1995); Bray, Robert Charles, Arthroscopic lateral release for anterior knee pain: A study comparing patients who are claiming worker's compensation with those who are not, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 237-247, (1987); Noyes, Frank R., A comparison of results of arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction between workers' compensation and noncompensation patients, Arthroscopy, 13, 4, pp. 474-484, (1997); Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); Tegner, Yelverton, Rating systems in the evaluation of knee ligament injuries, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 198, pp. 43-49, (1985); Kelly, Anne-Maree Maree, Patient satisfaction with pain management does not correlate with initial or discharge VAS pain score, verbal pain rating at discharge, or change in VAS score in the emergency department, Journal of Emergency Medicine, 19, 2, pp. 113-116, (2000); Beck, Charles L., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the endoscopic technique, Operative Techniques in Orthopaedics, 2, 2, pp. 86-98, (1992); Diment, Michael T., Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a central-third patellar tendon autograft and two incisions, Operative Techniques in Sports Medicine, 1, 1, pp. 45-49, (1993)","G.R.

The pre-injury Tegner activity level was 7 compared with 5 at the four- to seven-year follow-up (P<0.0001). The preoperative Lysholm score was 74.5 points. At the two-year follow-up, the Lysholm score was 95 points, while it was 90 points at the four- to seven-year follow-up (P<0.0001 preoperative vs two years and preoperative vs four to seven years and P<0.0005 two years vs four to seven years). Using the IKDC evaluation system, 80% of the patients were classified as normal or nearly normal and 20% as abnormal or severely abnormal at the final follow-up. The KT-1000 laxity measurements revealed a side-to-side difference of 2.9 mm preoperatively, 0.6 at two years and 1.0 mm at four to seven years. Twenty-six patients underwent additional surgery during the follow-up period. The results after arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament appear to be satisfactory both at the short- and the medium-term follow-ups, but there appears to be some deterioration between the two-year and the four- to seven-year follow-up.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Follow-up; Medium-term; Prospective; Reconstruction","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; male; methodology; middle aged; pathology; plastic surgery; prospective study; reoperation; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Reoperation; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the central third patellar tendon: A 5-8-year follow-up, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 3, pp. 138-144, (1997); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthrometric Results of Arthroscopically Assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction using Autograft Patellar Tendon Substitution, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 2, pp. 179-185, (1995); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Single-incision endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

The gait of 11 ACL-deficient patients was studied using Vicon equipment before and after surgery. Measurements of the angle between the patellar tendon and the long axis of the tibia were obtained in order to calculate TT in the sagittal plane relative to the uninjured limb during standing and walking. Before surgery, patients did not show abnormal TT on the injured side, but after surgery significant anterior TT was found in the operated limb for every parameter of gait. Abnormal anterior TT occurring during activity does not seem to be reduced by reconstruction; rather, it increases. It may be that the increased translation results from relaxation of excess contraction of the hamstring muscles, since compensatory muscle activity no longer is required in a reconstructed knee. The reduction of TT may not be an appropriate objective in surgery on the ACL.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; calculation; clinical article; controlled study; gait; hamstring; human; in vivo study; ligament surgery; measurement; muscle contraction; muscle relaxation; orthopedic equipment; patella tendon; priority journal; standing; tibia; walking","","","Vicon 370, Oxford Metrics","Oxford Metrics","","","Snyder-Mackler, Lynn, The relationship between passive joint laxity and functional outcome after anterior cruciate ligament injury, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 2, pp. 191-195, (1997); Forster, Ian W., Is the KT1000 knee ligament arthrometer reliable?, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 71, 5, pp. 843-847, (1989); Bray, Robert Charles, Meniscal lesions and chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency.

The hamstring tendon group showed better isokinetic knee extension strength than did the patellar tendon group after 6 months, but not after 12 and 24 months. There was a significant weakness in isokinetic knee flexion strength among the hamstring tendon group. Anterior knee pain was not significantly different between the groups, but kneeling pain was significantly less common in the hamstring tendon group after 24 months.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthralgia; article; autograft; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; hamstring; human; knee arthroplasty; knee function; major clinical study; patella; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; tendon graft","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Aune, Arne Kristian, Interference screw fixation of hamstring vs patellar tendon grafts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 2, pp. 99-102, (1998); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

Radiographic evaluation showed no patellofemoral osteoarthritis in 53 patients (group I), mild osteoarthritis in 34 patients (group II), moderate osteoarthritis in 12 patients, and severe osteoarthritis in 1 patient (group III, moderate and severe changes). The average shortening of the patellar tendon was 2.4 mm in group I, 3.9 mm in group II, and 6.8 mm in group III. The placement of the femoral or tibial tunnel of the graft, as measured from lateral radiographs, did not correlate significantly with the degree of patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Patients who developed patellofemoral osteoarthritis experienced worse final outcomes, were more often dissatisfied with the condition of the operated knee, experienced more frequent pain and swelling in the knee joint, and had poorer range of motion and poorer quadriceps muscle strength than did patients without patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Only three patients had an unstable knee, and degenerative changes in the tibiofemoral joint were uncommon.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; female; follow up; human; knee arthroplasty; knee instability; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; osteoarthritis; patella tendon; patellofemoral joint; postoperative complication; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Berg, Eugene E., Patellar height ratios.

Several MRI sequences were used to evaluate the 2-year postoperative appearance of asymptomatic knee with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructed with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) and semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) tendon autografts. Design and patients. Two groups with successful repair of ACL tear with BTB (n=10) or STG (n=10) autografts were imaged at 1.5 T with sagittal And oblique coronal proton density-, T2-weighted and sagittal STIR sequences and plain and contrast-enhanced oblique coronal T1-weighted sequences. The appearance of the graft and periligamentous tissues was evaluated. Results. In all 20 cases, the ACL graft showed homogeneous, low signal intensity with periligamentous streaks of intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In 10 cases, localised areas of intermediate signal intensity were seen in the intra-articular segment of the graft on proton density- and T1-weighted images. The graft itself did not show enhancement in either of the two groups, but mild to moderate periligamentous enhancement was detected in 10 cases. Conclusion. The MRI appearance of ACL autograft is variable on proton density- and T1-weighted images. Periligamentous tissue showing contrast enhancement is a typical MRI finding after clinically successful ACL reconstruction.","ACL; Anterior cruciate ligament; BTB; Contrast enhancement; MRI; STG","gadolinium pentetate; metal; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone screw; clinical article; clinical trial; contrast enhancement; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; femur; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; ligament surgery; male; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; plate fixation; postoperative period; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; tendon graft; tibia; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Screws; Bone Transplantation; Female; Humans; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Prospective Studies; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons","","","","","Helsingin ja Uudenmaan Sairaanhoitopiiri, HUS; Academy of Finland; Suomen Radiologiyhdistys; Pehr Oscar Klingendahlin Rahasto","Acknowledgements This study was supported in part by the Pehr Oscar Klingendahl Foundation, the Radiological Society of Finland, a Research Grant from Helsinki University Central Hospital, Academy of Finland and the Foundation of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Finland.","Jones, K.

Immediately after fixation, the change in the graft midsubstance length during passive knee flexion-extension was measured using a Hall-effect transducer, and anterior-posterior knee laxity was measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer. Subjects were divided into group 1 (N = 6), with graft elongation values bounded by the 95% confidence intervals of the normal anterior cruciate ligament elongation values, and group 2 (N = 7), subjects with values outside these intervals. Immediately after reconstruction, the side-to-side difference in anterior-posterior laxity between the reconstructed and uninjured knees was not different between group 1 (-2.6 ± 0.7 mm, mean ± SEM) and group 2 (-1.7 ± 1.0 mm) (P = 0.49). At 5-year follow-up, the difference was 1.2 ± 0.7 mm for group 1, while for group 2 it was significantly greater at 4.7 ± 0.6 mm (P = 0.004). At surgery, graft elongation values produced by flexion of the knee that are outside the limits of the anterior cruciate ligament result in significant increases in anterior knee laxity at long-term follow-up, while grafts with elongation values similar to the normal anterior cruciate ligament do not. Not only is restoration of anterior-posterior laxity values to within normal limits important, but the biomechanical behavior of the graft produced by flexion-extension of the knee should be appreciated.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; bone graft; clinical article; controlled study; female; follow up; force transducer; human; in vivo study; instrumentation; joint laxity; knee function; long term care; male; priority journal; stretching; tendon graft","","","KT-1000 arthrometer, Medmetric","Medmetric","National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (T32AR007568)","","Beynnon, Bruce D., The measurement of anterior cruciate ligament strain in vivo, International Orthopaedics, 16, 1, pp. 1-12, (1992); Beynnon, Bruce D., The measurement of elongation of anterior cruciate-ligament grafts in vivo, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 76, 4, pp. 520-531, (1994); Bylski-Austrow, Donita I., Anterior cruciate ligament replacements: A mechanical study of femoral attachment location, flexion angle at tensioning, and initial tension, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 8, 4, pp. 522-531, (1990); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior knee laxity in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament disruption, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 13, 6, pp. 401-407, (1985); Anterior Cruciate Ligament Current and Future Concepts, (1993); Fleming, Braden C., An in vivo comparison between intraoperative isometric measurement and local elongation of the graft after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 76, 4, pp. 511-519, (1994); Fleming, Braden C., Calibration and application of an intra-articular force transducer for the measurement of patellar tendon graft forces: An in situ evaluation, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 121, 4, pp. 393-398, (1999); Fleming, Braden C., Factors influencing the output of an implantable force transducer, Journal of Biomechanics, 33, 7, pp. 889-893, (2000); Grood, Edward S., The correlation between anterior‐posterior translation and cross‐sectional area of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 10, 6, pp. 878-885, (1992); Hamada, Masayuki, Preoperative anterior knee laxity did not influence postoperative stability restored by anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 16, 5, pp. 477-482, (2000)","","","American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","11292040","English","Am.

The same postoperative rehabilitation protocol was used for all patients and follow-up at a median of 31 months (24 to 59) was carried out by independent observers. Four patients (2%) were lost to follow-up. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding the Stryker laxity test, one-leg hop test, Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, patellofemoral pain score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score or visual analogue scale, reflecting patient satisfaction and knee function. Slightly decreased extension, compared with the non-operated side, was found in the patellar tendon group (p<0.05). Patients with associated meniscal injuries had lower IKDC, visual analogue (p<0.01) and Lysholm scores (p<0.05) than those without such injuries. Patients in whom reconstruction had been carried out less than five months after the injury had better final IKDC scores than the more chronic cases (p<0.05). We conclude that patellar tendon and quadruple semitendinous tendon grafts have similar outcomes in the medium term. Associated meniscal pathology significantly affects the final outcome and early reconstruction seems to be beneficial.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; bone screw; clinical protocol; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; injury; knee function; knee instability; knee meniscus; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; outcomes research; patella; pathology; patient satisfaction; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; randomization; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; rehabilitation; scoring system; semitendinous muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; visual analog scale","","","","","","","Webb, Jonathan M., Endoscopic reconstruction for isolated anterior cruciate ligament rupture, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 80, 2, pp. 288-294, (1998); Engebretsen, Lars, A prospective, randomized study of three surgical techniques for treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 6, pp. 585-590, (1990); Feagin, John A., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Bone-patella tendon-bone versus semitendinosus anatomic reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 341, pp. 69-72, (1997); Grøntvedt, Torbjørn, Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts with and without augmentation, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 78, 5, pp. 817-822, (1996); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); O'Neill, Daniel B., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A prospective randomized analysis of three techniques, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 78, 6, pp. 803-813, (1996); Marder, Richard A., Prospective evaluation of arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Knee joint proprioception was assessed with a new method designed to test joint position sense. The Lysholm score for the tibial eminence group was 94 ± 7. Only the patients in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient group demonstrated statistically significantly increased laxity and inferior proprioception when the injured leg was compared with the uninjured leg. Both laxity and proprioception were statistically inferior for the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient group when compared with both the treated tibial eminence fracture group and the anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed group. No statistically significant difference was observed between the anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed and treated tibial eminence fracture groups. Correlation was observed between laxity and proprioception when all patients were analyzed.

Preoperatively, there were no significant differences between groups. At a mean of 35.4 ± 11.6 months postoperatively, 102 patients returned for evaluation. International Knee Documentation Committee knee evaluation revealed no significant differences in symptoms, function, return to pre-injury activity, harvest site abnormalities, or limitation of motion between groups 1 and 3. Patients in group 2 had a higher incidence of patellofemoral crepitation and loss of motion than did patients in group 3. The mean manual maximum KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was 2.1 ± 2.0 mm in group 1, which was statistically significantly better than the difference in group 3 (3.1 ± 2.3 mm). Final knee rating showed that 34 of 35 patients in group 1, 23 of 34 patients in group 2, and 26 of 33 patients in group 3 had a normal or nearly normal overall knee rating. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a semitendinosus and gracilis or a patellar tendon autograft may yield similar subjective results; however, the patellar tendon autograft may provide better objective stability in the long term. In addition, there appears to be no benefit to combining an intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an extraarticular procedure.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; device; female; follow up; gracilis muscle; human; intermethod comparison; knee function; knee instability; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella; patella tendon; patellofemoral joint; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; semitendinous muscle; surgical technique; symptomatology; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","KT-1000, Medmetric","Medmetric","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Alm, Anders, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by using the medial third of the patellar ligament.

The aim of ACL-reconstruction is to achieve normal function of the knee by using different approaches and grafts. Methods: The results of fifty patients who had had a reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) through a small arthrotomy, with the use of the central third of an autogenous, bone-patellar tendon-bone free graft, at King Hussein Medical Center, between the years 1994-1997, were reviewed retrospectively. Forty five (90%) patients were active soldiers between the ages of 20-30 years. The average time between injury and operation was 27 months (1-72). The analysis of causes of injury revealed that 50% were sport injuries (contact and non-contact), 46% due to fall and twisting injuries. All patients presented with knee pain, recurrent swelling, and giving way either partial or full. Twenty eight (56%) knees had an associated meniscal injury. The patients had an aggressive rehabilitation program advocated by Shelbourne and Nitz, aiming for early restoration and maintenance of movement and strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings. The patients were evaluated by clinical examination, radiological assessment, subjective questionnaire, and the functional status was evaluated according to the scoring scale of Lysholm and Gilliquist. Results: Based on the above scoring system we found that 45(90%) knees were graded as excellent or good and no longer gave way. Full motion (0-135 degree) was restored in all knees except in two who had restriction of flexion. No evidence of degenerative changes were seen except in one patient who developed late infection. The unsolved problem of anterior knee pain developed in ten (20%) patients. Conclusion: This procedure, with the patient's cooperation and understanding of the rehabilitation program, yielded results similar to those of other procedures.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthrotomy; article; clinical article; clinical examination; clinical feature; functional assessment; hamstring; human; knee function; knee meniscus rupture; ligament surgery; male; operation duration; patella tendon; quadriceps femoris muscle; questionnaire; radiodiagnosis; retrospective study; scoring system; surgical approach; surgical technique","","","","","","","Sandberg, Rolf, Operative versus non-operative treatment of recent injuries to the ligaments of the knee.

Background: The patient was a 28-year-old female who Sustained a traumatic injury to her left knee while playing ice hockey. After 6 weeks of rehabilitation (15 visits), the athlete elected to undergo ACL reconstruction following buckling episodes that she experienced during both skating and walking. Methods and Measures: Following ACL reconstruction using a patellar tendon autograft, the patient was treated for 6 months in 44 visits. Initial treatments consisted of effusion management, neuromuscular control of lower extremity muscles, and regaining passive range of motion, especially extension. Although instability testing revealed a negative pivot shift and a 2-millimeter side-to-side difference on KT-1000 examination, the patient reported a sensation of buckling when she attempted skating at 4 months (27 visits) following ACL reconstruction. Off-ice strength and functional testing of the lower extremity did not demonstrate deficits. At that time, a specific neuromuscular program for returning a patient to ice hockey was implemented. Results: Following 17 physical therapy visits, which combined sport-specific and sex-specific neuromuscular rehabilitation, the patient was able to return to competitive ice hockey. Six months following ACL reconstruction, the patient reported no feeling of instability during skating. The patient reported a Lysholm score of 100 and Tegner activity score of 9. An onice functional test revealed the athlete's score was 80% of her pre-injury score. Conclusions: Failure of static knee stabilizers can be a cause of instability. Following ACL reconstruction, a neuromuscular rehabilitation program may prevent residual knee instability once the static stabilizers have been restored. A sport-specific neuromuscular rehabilitation program for the athlete participating in ice hockey should be considered.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Ice hockey; Knee instability; Sex-specific rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; athlete; autograft; case report; female; functional assessment; human; knee injury; knee ligament injury; leg movement; ligament injury; medical instrumentation; muscle strength; patella tendon; sport injury; tendon graft","","","KT-1000 knee arthrometer","","","","Beard, David John, Proprioception enhancement for anterior cruciate ligament deficiency.

The randomized prospective clinical study consisted of 2 groups with 15 patients each, admitted at our center with acute (< 8 weeks) traumatic loss of ACL-stability. The ACL-reconstruction was performed in open technique using a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft and fixation with bioresorbable (study group) or titanium (control group) interference screws. Results: Employing a special questionnaire patients' satisfaction was recorded. Functional results were scored using clinical examination and the Lachman test under sonographic control. Foreign-body reactions against the implants were assessed by clinical examinations and on radiographs. The follow-up of all patients was at least for 2 years. Ligament stability of the knee joint, operative and postoperative complication rate did not significantly differ between the two groups. 14 patients of the study group and 13 patients of the control group were completely satisfied. One patient of the study group was dissatisfied because of developing an infection. Conclusion: The results using bioresorbable interference screws in ACL-reconstruction are identic to those employing standard titanium implants. Differences in rates of operative and postoperative complications were not statistically significant. The advantages of the bioresorbable implants include the absence of urgent implant removal in case of secondary ACL-reconstruction procedures and undisturbed MRI and CT scans postoperatively.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bioresorbable interference screws; Patellar tendon autograft","titanium; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; biodegradable implant; bone screw; clinical article; clinical examination; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; device; double blind procedure; female; foreign body reaction; human; joint stability; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; patient satisfaction; postoperative complication; randomized controlled trial; surgical technique; tendon graft","","titanium, 7440-32-6","sterrat 7, Johnson and Johnson","Johnson and Johnson","","","An, Yuehuei H., Fixation of osteotomies using bioabsorbable screws in the canine femur, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 355, pp. 300-311, (1998); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

The arthroscopic procedure with single incision was supposed to increase stability and to improve proprioception by earlier rehabilitation. 29 patients with ACL deficiency were included in the study. 15 patients were treated endoscopically, 14 patients by using the two-tunnel technique. Proprioception, Lysholm and Tegner scores as well as stability (KT-1000) were assessed preoperatively, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. A deficit of proprioception was assessed in either group preoperatively, which could be improved after 3 months only in the arthroscopic group. 6 months postoperatively, either group showed a restitution of proprioception near full extension and full flexion of the knee. In the mid range position, the proprioception could not be restored. There were no differences in stability and the Lysholm and Tegner scores between the groups after 6 months postoperatively. The comparison between the patients with acute and chronic instability shows a better proprioception in the acute group in the mid range position 6 months after the reconstruction.","ACL deficiency; Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction; Joint proprioception; Restitution of proprioception; Two-tunnel technique","anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; clinical article; human; joint instability; knee arthroplasty; proprioception; scoring system; surgical technique; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Postoperative Complications; Proprioception; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Barrack, Robert L., Proprioception of the knee joint.

This article describes the results of replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament using the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. The evaluation after five years shows the advantages and the morbidity within this technique. Methods, 46 consecutive ACL reconstructions were performed. The author describes the operative technique and the rehabilitation protocol. The pre-injury sports activities were collected and grouped into categories on the basis of the demands in terms of knee stability. Clinical evaluation was conducted according to the International Knee Documentation Committee guidelines. Return to sport was analysed. Results. After a minimum five-year follow-up there were 80,5% normal or nearly normal knees in the IKDC evaluation. Overall outcome was not age or sex dependent. Subjective result was good in thirty six patients. No problem was found to the extensor knee mechanism. A second surgery for removal of painful prominent hardware was required. Thirteen athletes reduced their level of sports activity and four could not return to sport because of knee-related change. Conclusions. The semitendinosus and gracilis tendons autografts offer several advantages for reconstruction of antero-lateral instability over the central third of the patellar tendon. The hamstring replacement provides a large surface area of revascularization, a precise positioning, and an easy tensioning. The fast knee motion recovery allows this surgical procedure as the first choice for a torn ACL reconstruction in the middle aged patient (over forty years). A careful patient selection accomplishes good results. On the bases of this study it is author's opinion that ACL replacement with doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendons can reduce the incidence of failed return to sport.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Antero-lateral chronic instability; Semitendinosus and gracilis autografts","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; male; semitendinous muscle; sport injury; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Jones, K.

Also, the isokinetic muscle torque was measured. At 7 years, anterior knee pain, as classified by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), was absent in 40 patients, mild in 47 patients, and moderate in 4 patients. None was classified as suffering from severe anterior knee pain. In the logistic regression analysis of predicting factors (forward-stepping), knee extension torque deficit of the operated limb was the only factor that showed significant association with anterior knee pain. The other objective measurements of the knee (flexion torque deficit, range of motion, stability evaluation, and radiographic evaluation of the knee) were not associated with anterior knee pain. Subjectively and not surprisingly, the patients without anterior knee pain were more often satisfied with the overall outcome than the patients with anterior knee pain. Also, the Lysholm and Marshall knee scores and the final outcome in the IKDC rating scale were significantly better in patients without than with anterior knee pain.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior knee pain; Reconstruction; Torque deficit","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthropathy; article; female; follow up; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; pain; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; tendon; time; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Diseases; Knee Joint; Male; Pain; Postoperative Complications; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendons; Time Factors","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

This technique shortens the tendon portion to match the intra-articular length by rotating 1 bone plug 180°proximally onto the tendon, thus flipping the bone plug over its ligamentous insertion. Bioscrews (poly L-lactic acid; Linvatec, Largo, FL) secured the grafts. All patients undergoing this procedure with a minimum 21 months follow-up were reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative Tegner, Lysholm, and IKDC activity scores, and Lachman and pivot shift tests were obtained. Postoperative KT testing and radiographs were obtained. Fifty patients were followed-up for an average of 28 months (range, 21 to 39 months). Average patient age was 34 years (range, 16 to 52 years). Tegner scores increased from 2.0 preoperatively to 6.0 postoperatively. Lysholm scores increased from 46 preoperatively to 93 at follow-up, with 86% excellent (66%) or good (20%). IKDC activity scores increased from 3.1 preoperatively to 1.7 postoperatively. KT manual-maximum difference at follow-up averaged 0.7 mm, with 74% less than 3-mm, 18% 3- to 5-mm, and 8% greater than 5-mm difference. Postoperative Lachman results were 0 in 45 patients and 1 + in 5 patients. Postoperative pivot shift was absent in all but 1 patient. Full extension was achieved in all cases and flexion averaged 136°with no patient having less than 120°flexion. No lytic bone changes or tunnel widening were seen. The flipped patellar tendon autograft reduces graft length to its intra- articular portion, increasing graft stability, isometry, and stiffness, and avoiding tunnel graft mismatch with clinically excellent results.","ACL reconstruction; Bioscrew; Flip; Interference fixation; Isometric; Patellar tendon autograft; Tunnel mismatch","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; clinical article; female; graft survival; human; knee arthroplasty; male; patella; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Paulos, Lonnie E., Knee rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and repair, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 9, 3, pp. 140-149, (1981); Lakartidningen, (1968); Gillquist, Jan, Reconstruction for old rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Type of Study: Prospective randomized. Materials and Methods: Forty patients who underwent endoscopic ACL reconstruction were included in the study and randomized intraoperatively. Group A consisted of 20 patients (6 women, 14 men; mean age, 29.6 years) who had femoral bone block fixation with a bioabsorbable interference screw and tibial fixation with a titanium interference screw. Group B included 20 patients (5 women, 15 men; mean age 29.6 years) who had fixation of both femoral and tibial bone blocks with titanium interference screws. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to age, gender, height, weight, time from injury to surgery, activity level, and concomitant injuries. Results: Clinical results (using IKDC, Lysholm, Tegner scores) of the 2 groups as well as instrumented laxity measurements (KT-1000) did not show significant (P > .05) differences at any stage of follow-up. No complications with respect to graft fixation could be found. Computed tomography scans, performed within the first postoperative week, at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively revealed a uniform picture for all patients within the groups, showing completed screw degradation at 12 months in group A. Conclusion: Polyglyconate interference screw fixation for patellar tendon grafts has not been found to be associated with increased clinical complications or significant osteolysis. It provided equivalent fixation and clinical results compared with titanium screws. However, replacement of the screw with bone did not take place for up to 3 years postoperatively.","ACL reconstruction; Bioabsorbable interference screw; Polyglyconate","maxon; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; biodegradable implant; bone graft; bone screw; clinical article; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; male; patella tendon; surgical technique","","maxon, 75734-93-9","EndoFix, Smith and Nephew","Smith and Nephew","","","Barber, Frank Alan, Preliminary results of an absorbable interference screw, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 5, pp. 537-548, (1995); Bryan, James M., Comparison of ""inside-out"" and ""outside-in"" interference screw fixation for anterior cruciate ligament surgery in a bovine knee, Arthroscopy - Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 12, 1, pp. 76-81, (1996); Gerich, Torsten G., Pullout strength of tibial graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament replacement with a patellar tendon graft: Interference screw versus staple fixation in human knees, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 2, pp. 84-88, (1997); Hulstyn, Michael J., Biomechanical evaluation of interference screw fixation in a bovine patellar bone-tendon-bone autograft complex for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 9, 4, pp. 417-424, (1993); Kurosaka, Masahiro, A biomechanical comparison of different surgical techniques of graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 225-229, (1987); Marti, Christoph B., Metallic versus bioabsorbable interference screw for fixation of bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A preliminary report, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 5, 4, pp. 217-221, (1997); Stähelin, Andreas C., Clinical degradation and biocompatibility of different bioabsorbable interference screws: A report of six cases, Arthroscopy, 13, 2, pp. 238-244, (1997); Tuompo, Pertti K., Strength of the fixation of patellar tendon bone grafts using a totally absorbable self-reinforced poly-l-lactide expansion plug and screw.

One surgeon performed anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on 124 patients with unilateral ruptures and no history of previous incisions in the anterior knee region. The traditional one-incision graft harvesting technique was used in 58 patients and the subcutaneous two-incision technique was used in 66 patients. At 2 years, the International Knee Documentation Committee classification, Lysholm score, arthrometry side-to-side difference, and single-legged hop test showed no significant differences between groups. The area of insensitivity was a median of 24 cm2 in the traditional harvest group and 0 cm2 in the subcutaneous harvest group. The patients with subcutaneous harvest had a tendency toward fewer problems during walking on their knees than did the patients with traditional harvest. Our conclusion is that the subcutaneous two-incision graft harvesting technique caused less disturbance in anterior knee sensitivity and a tendency of less discomfort during walking on one's knees than the traditional one-incision technique.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical trial; female; follow up; human; human cell; human tissue; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; priority journal; scoring system; surgical approach; surgical technique; tendon graft","","","","","","","J Bone Joint Surg, (1945); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Arthornthurasook, Art, Study of the infrapatellar nerve, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 16, 1, pp. 57-59, (1988); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthrometric Results of Arthroscopically Assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction using Autograft Patellar Tendon Substitution, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 2, pp. 179-185, (1995); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Berg, P., A lateral skin incision reduces peripatellar dysaesthesia after knee surgery, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 73, 3, pp. 374-376, (1991); Breitfuss, H., The tendon defect after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the midthird patellar tendon-a problem for the patellofemoral joint?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 194-198, (1996); Buss, Daniel D., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with use of autogenous patellar-ligament grafts.

The thickness was significantly increased compared with the intact contralateral patellar tendon, regardless of when the magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Ultrasonography showed the same findings at a mean follow-up of 26 months. Histologic evaluation of the repair tissue in the central part of the tendon, as well as the tissue in the peripheral part of the patellar tendon at the donor site, revealed a significant increase in cellularity and vascularity as compared with normal control tendons.

Sixteen men and nine women (average age, 23.8 years) were evaluated preoperatively, then underwent intraarticular autogenous patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by the same surgeon and were evaluated at 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. Muscle strength was measured isokinetically and neuromuscular function was quantified with simultaneous anterior tibial translation and surface electromyography tests. Forty subjects (26 men and 14 women; average age, 23.5 years) with no known knee abnormalities served as the control group. Subjective questionnaire results showed that by 18 months postoperatively, 20 subjects (80%) believed they had regained their preoperative levels of function. Unfortunately, muscle function in most subjects had not returned to normal. At 12 to 18 months postoperatively, when knee rehabilitation was terminated, significant deficiencies in muscle performance persisted in most patients. Interestingly, in this group of stable knees, quadriceps and hamstring muscle reaction times appeared to be the best objective indicators of subjective knee function.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; follow up; human; human cell; human tissue; joint laxity; knee function; male; muscle function; muscle strength; neuromuscular function; priority journal; tendon graft","","","","","","","Adalberth, Torsten, Magnetic resonance imaging, scintigraphy, and arthroscopic evaluation of traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 2, pp. 231-237, (1997); Barrack, Robert L., Evidence of reinnervation of free patellar tendon autograft used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 2, pp. 196-202, (1997); Barrack, Robert L., Proprioception in the anterior cruciate deficient knee, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 1, pp. 1-6, (1989); Barret, D.

From January 1991 to November 1996 we experienced only 2 infected knees in 1, 300 reconstructions, but between December 1996 and February 1997 10 patients in 70 ACL reconstructions developed a postoperative suspected infection. We found the origin of contamination (coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) in the supposedly sterile inflow cannula. When we changed this device, we had only 1 infection in the next 400 reconstructions. The diagnosis in these cases was derived from clinical signs and laboratory results, but only 2 of 11 samples of aspirated synovial fluid tested positive for Staphylococcus. The mean interval between the surgery and the onset of signs of infection and the start of antibiotic therapy was 7.7 days. All the patients had antibiotic association at the highest level. Six knees underwent arthroscopic debridement when the clinical signs indicated resistence to antibiotics. The normal postoperative rehabilitation program was modified but was not discontinued. Although recovery time was longer, overall results were similar to uncomplicated reconstructions. On the basis of our experience, we believe that when there is a notable increase in infection rates, a thorough search for contamination is indicated. Our source of infection was material that was thought to be sterile. Ultimately, early diagnosis and treatment is of critical importance to obtain good results. Even suspicion of infective postoperative complication should be sufficient cause to search for responsible microorganisms and begin antibiotic therapy. Arthroscopic debridement should be proposed to patients with resistence to antibiotics.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone; Patellar tendon; Septic arthritis","antibiotic agent; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; antibiotic resistance; article; clinical article; coagulase negative Staphylococcus; debridement; human; human cell; human tissue; knee arthroplasty; postoperative infection; rating scale; surgical technique","","","","","","","Jackson, Robert W.M.D., The septic knee—Arthroscopic treatment, Arthroscopy, 1, 3, pp. 194-197, (1985); Arthroscopy, (1988); Smith, Michael J., Arthroscopic treatment of the septic knee, Arthroscopy, 2, 1, pp. 30-34, (1986); Bernhang, Arthur M., Clostridium pyoarthrosis following arthroscopy, Arthroscopy, 3, 1, pp. 56-58, (1987); Thiery, J.

We performed an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in a single hindlimb of 11 sheep using a doubled semitendinosus tendon autograft secured to the femur with an endoscopic button and polyester tape and to the tibia with sutures tied around a screw. The histologic structure of the intraarticular segment of the graft at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 52 weeks after surgery was compared with that of the normal semitendinosus tendon and anterior cruciate ligament. The random collagen fiber orientation progressed to a longitudinal orientation from the peripheral to the central areas of the graft over the initial 12 weeks after surgery. A uniform sinusoidal crimp pattern similar to that seen in the normal anterior cruciate ligament was identified under polarized light in nearly one-half of each graft by 24 weeks. Further maturation was noted at 52 weeks. Graft necrosis was not evident at any time period. This study showed that semitendinosus tendon autografts transform into a histologic structure similar to that of the normal anterior cruciate ligament over the initial year after surgery, as has been described for patellar tendon grafts.","","collagen fiber; animal model; animal tissue; anterior cruciate ligament; article; controlled study; hamstring; ligament surgery; nonhuman; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; sheep; tendon graft","","","","","","","Amiel, David A., Tendons and ligaments: A morphological and biochemical comparison, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 1, 3, pp. 257-265, (1983); Amiel, David A., The natural history of the anterior cruciate ligament autograft of patellar tendon origin, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 6, pp. 449-462, (1986); Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anterior cruciate ligament replacement using patellar tendon.

We retrospectively who have Workers' Compensation claims. This minimum 2-year follow-up study analyzed the occupational, functional, and objective results of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction at our institution between 1987 and 1995 were included in the current study . All reconstruction were performed by the senior author (B.R.B.) using arthroscopic-assisted techniques (single and double-incision) with bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts followed by an accelerated rehabilitation protocol. Postoperative follow-up physical examinations revealed a negative anterior drawer in 19 patients (91%), a negative Lachman in 15 patients (68%), and a negative pivot shift in 21 patients (96%). The KT-1000 arthrometric evaluation at follow-up showed a mean maximum manual difference of 1.9 mm with 15 patients (68%) having a maximum manual difference of <3 mm and 7 patients (32%) from 3 to 5 mm. The mean postoperative scores for the Hospital for Special Surgery scoring scale was 86, Noyes Sports activity scale 81, Noyes ADL score 36, Noyes Problem with Sports 75, Noyes Sports Function score 87, Lysholm score 82, and the Tegner score 5.9. The Noyes Occupational rating system increased from preoperative 48 to 60 postoperatively and the Noyes Job Title rating system scare remained at 5 after surgery. Functional testing revealed mean deficits of no more than 9% between the reconstructed and normal knees. SF-36 testing revealed significantly higher scores in the Role Physical and General Health categories and a significantly lower score in the Mental Health category when compared with United States norms. Subjective evaluation revealed that 95% of the patients would undergo a similar procedure if faced with a similar injury to the contralateral knee in the future. The results of the current study show that ACL reconstruction leads to predictable functional and occupational results in those patients with work-related injuries. All of our patients were able to return to work. The hypothesis that Workers' Compensation compromises the results of ACL reconstruction was not observed in this study.","ACL reconstruction; Workers' compensation claims","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical article; female; function test; human; ligament surgery; male; patient satisfaction; physical examination; rating scale; reoperation; tendon rupture; treatment outcome; workman compensation","","","","","","","Arciero, Robert A., Single versus two-incision arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 12, 4, pp. 462-469, (1996); Am J Knee Surg, (1989); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Single-incision endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft.

Mean KT-1000 arthrometer results were 1.9 ± 1.3 mm for the contralateral group and 2.2 ± 1.1 mm for the ipsilateral group. The mean time to return to sports at full capability in a competitive subgroup was 4.1 months for contralateral patients and 5.5 months for ipsilateral patients. Overall, 49% of patients in the contralateral group and 12% of patients in the ipsilateral group returned to their preinjury levels of activity by 4 months postoperatively. Our results indicate that the contralateral patellar tendon can be used to restore range of motion and strength sooner than an ipsilateral patellar tendon graft. Patients can also have a faster return to full capability in sports without compromising ultimate stability.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; female; human; knee function; knee instability; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); de Carlo, Mark S., Rehabilitation program for both knees when the contralateral autogenous patellar tendon graft is used for primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A case study, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 29, 3, pp. 144-159, (1999); Engebretsen, Lars, A prospective, randomized study of three surgical techniques for treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 6, pp. 585-590, (1990); Graf, Ben K., Complications of intra-articular anterior cruciate reconstruction., Clinics in sports medicine, 7, 4, pp. 835-848, (1988); Lephart, Scott M., Quadriceps strength and functional capacity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Patellar tendon autograft versus allograft, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 5, pp. 738-743, (1993); Marder, Richard A., Prospective evaluation of arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Type of Study: Prospective case series. Materials and Methods: Thirty meniscal repairs in 29 patients were evaluated by a comprehensive examination (28 repairs) a mean of 34 months postoperatively, by follow-up arthroscopy (6 repairs) a mean of 24 months postoperatively, or both. The mean age of the patients at the time of the meniscal repair was 45 years (range, 40 to 58 years). Twenty-one patients (72%) also had ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament, which were reconstructed at the time of the meniscal repair with bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts (16 patients) or allografts (5 patients). The Cincinnati Knee Rating System was used to rate symptoms, functional limitations with sports and daily activities, patient perception of the knee condition, and sports and occupational rating levels. Results: At a mean of 33 months postoperatively, 26 meniscal repairs (87%) were asymptomatic for tibiofemoral joint symptoms and had not required subsequent surgery. Three repairs failed to heal, requiring partial meniscectomy, and 1 knee with tibiofemoral symptoms related to the repair was treated conservatively. There was no significant effect of the side of the meniscal repair, chronicity of injury, or condition of the articular cartilage on the presence of tibiofemoral symptoms or meniscal resection. Concomitant anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction appeared to increase the rate of asymptomatic meniscal repairs. The patient rating of overall knee condition was normal/very good in 76%, good in 12%, and fair/poor in 12%. Conclusions: In athletically active patients, we recommend the preservation of meniscal tissue wherever possible regardless of age, basing indications for the procedure on current and future activity levels.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Avascular meniscus repair; Middle-aged","adult; article; autograft; clinical article; female; human; knee arthroscopy; knee function; knee meniscus rupture; male; pathological anatomy; surgical anatomy; surgical technique; treatment indication","","","","","","Supported in part by the Cincinnati Sportsmedicine Research and Education Foundation.","Barber, Frank Alan, Meniscus repair: Results of an arthroscopic technique, Arthroscopy, 3, 1, pp. 25-30, (1987); DeHaven, Kenneth E., Long-Term Results of Open Meniscal Repair, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 5, pp. 524-530, (1995); Eggli, Stefan, Long-term Results of Arthroscopic Meniscal Repair: An Analysis of Isolated Tears, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 715-720, (1995); Morgan, Craig D., Arthroscopic meniscal repair evaluated by second-look arthroscopy, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 6, pp. 632-638, (1991); Buseck, M.

Fourteen patients with a STG-endobutton ACL reconstruction were examined 3 months (n = 1), 1 year (n = 1) and 2 years (n = 12) postoperatively. An age- and sex-matched group with a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autograft ACL reconstruction with similar follow-up was taken as control. Data on clinical examination, laxity and isokinetic muscle torque measurements, anteroposterior and lateral view radiography were obtained, and knee scores (Lysholm and Tegner) were collected. Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed in the STG-endobutton group with a 1.5-T imager. There were no statistical differences between the groups with respect to clinical findings, stability tests, or knee scores. In the STG-endobutton group the average femoral and tibial bone tunnel diameter detected on anteroposterior view radiography had increased at 2-year follow-up by 33% and 23%, respectively. On MRI the ligamentous graft itself was not enhanced by the contrast medium whereas periligamentous tissue within and around the STG graft bundles showed mild contrast enhancement. In conclusion, the MRI results suggest that enhancing periligamentous tissue accumulated in and around the STG graft associated with the tunnel expansion. In spite of the significant bone tunnel enlargement observed on the follow-up radiography the STG-endobutton knees were stable and the patients satisfied.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bone tunnel enlargement; Hamstring tendons; Magnetic resonance imaging; Radiographic evaluation","contrast medium; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; bone screw; case control study; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; femur; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; knee injury; male; muscle contraction; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella ligament; pathology; patient satisfaction; physiology; postoperative complication; prospective study; radiography; randomized controlled trial; tendon; tibia; torque; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Case-Control Studies; Contrast Media; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Internal Fixators; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Muscle Contraction; Patellar Ligament; Patient Satisfaction; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendons; Tibia; Torque; Transplantation, Autologous","","Contrast Media, 0","","","","Acknowledgements This study was supported financially by the Orthopedic and Traumatology Investigation Foundation, Helsinki University Central Hospital Foundation, and Per Oscar Klingen-dahl Foundation.","Aune, Arne Kristian, Interference screw fixation of hamstring vs patellar tendon grafts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 2, pp. 99-102, (1998); Barrett, Gene R., Endobutton button endoscopie fixation technique in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 3, pp. 340-343, (1995); Clancy, William G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using one-third of the patellar ligament, augmented by extra-articular tendon transfers, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 64, 3, pp. 352-359, (1982); Arthroscopy, (1995); Fahey, Mark, Bone Tunnel Enlargement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 410-414, (1994); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993); 8th Esska Congress, (1998); Howell, Stephen M., Revascularization of a Human Anterior Cruciate Ligament Graft During the First Two Years of Implantation, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 42-49, (1995); Hueftle, Mark G., Lumbar spine: Postoperative MR imaging with Gd-DTPA, Radiology, 167, 3, pp. 817-824, (1988); Hoeher, Jürgen, Bone tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Fact or fiction?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 6, 4, pp. 231-240, (1998)","H.J.

Twenty subjects who experienced acute ACL disruption and underwent reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft participated in a controlled rehabilitation program and were studied at a mean follow-up of 2 years. A control group of ten subjects were also studied. In both groups proprioception was evaluated by measuring the threshold to detection of passive motion (TDPM) with the knee at 15° of flexion with and without a functional knee brace applied. The Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Cincinnati knee score, and two functional knee tests were also used as outcome measurements. Anterior-posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur was evaluated with the KT-1000 arthrometer. There were no significant differences in TDPM between the ACL-reconstructed and contralateral knees, or between the ACL reconstructed group and the healthy control group. Bracing did not produce a significant change in the TDPM for the ACL-reconstructed group or for the control group. There were low to moderate correlations between TDPM and the other outcome measurements. This study indicates that there is no significant differences in proprioception between the ACL-reconstructed knee and the contralateral uninvolved knee 1 year or more after surgery. Functional knee bracing does not seem to improve proprioception in patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction and been followed up on average 2 years after surgery.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Brace; Knee function; Proprioception","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone transplantation; brace; case control study; differential threshold; female; femur; follow up; human; knee; knee injury; knee osteoarthritis; male; middle aged; movement (physiology); patella ligament; pathophysiology; physiology; proprioception; retrospective study; tibia; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Transplantation; Braces; Case-Control Studies; Differential Threshold; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patellar Ligament; Proprioception; Retrospective Studies; Tibia; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Barber, Sue D., Quantitative assessment of functional limitations in normal and anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 255, pp. 204-214, (1990); Barrack, Robert L., Proprioception of the knee joint.

The aim of this paper is to report the outcome in four patients in whom the graft (bone-patellar tendon-bone) was dropped onto the operating-room floor during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and was then re-implanted after decontamination by topic antibiotic treatment. Material and methods. Between 1992 and 1996, 1038 anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were performed. In four cases, the bone- patellar-tendon-bone graft was dropped onto the operating theater floor. The graft was then soaked in rifamycin at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml in normal saline for 10 mn, and soaked in gentamycin at 0.6 mg/ml for a further 10 mn. Finally, the graft was washed in physiological saline. All cases had been given a loading dose of second generation cephalosporin (cefamandole), after deflating the tourniquet. Post-operatively, the patients were given amoxicillin and clavulanic acid for 15 days. The patients were reviewed radiologially and clinically (IKDC form) with a mean follow-up of 24 months. Results. Post operatively all patients had an uncomplicated recovery. No wound problems was observed in 3 of the four patients achieved an IKDC grade A knee. The final patient had a grade B, after 55 month follow-up. All patients recovered their initial sport level. The radiological Lachman test shows a mean differential value of 0.3 mm. Discussion. Dropping the graft during ACL reconstruction is a very rare problem. In this event, the surgeon can choose several options: Harvesting an other site, sterilizing the graft by irradiation, autoclaving, ethylene oxyde..., or using a topical antibiotic treatment. Cooper showed, in an in vitro study that the contamination rate was halved by antibiotic soaking of the graft. Conclusion. We used a topic antibiotic treatment with success in all four cases. We feel warranted the implantation of a graft which has been dropped, and then antibiotic soaked. The patient should of course be informed and told to report any sign or symptom of infection. On the strength of this result, we would like to propose a decontamination protocol which can be used in this sort of incident, fortunately very rare.","ACL reconstruction; Bone-tendon graft; Complication; Contamination; Knee","amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; cefamandole; gentamicin; rifamycin; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; case report; graft infection; human; infection risk; instrument sterilization; knee arthroplasty; patella tendon; postoperative care; sport; bacterial infection; intraoperative period; patella; postoperative complication; tendon; tibia; transplantation; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bacterial Infections; Humans; Intraoperative Period; Patella; Postoperative Complications; Tendons; Tibia","","","augmentin; gentalline; kefandol; rifocine","","","","Cooper, Daniel E., Contaminated patellar tendon grafts: Incidence of positive cultures and efficacy of an antibiotic solution soak-An in vitro study, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 7, 3, pp. 272-274, (1991); Sterilization of Medical Products, (1981); Rev Chir Orthop, (1989); Fideler, Bradley M., Gamma Irradiation: Effects on Biomechanical Properties of Human Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone Allografts, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 5, pp. 643-646, (1995); Gingrass, Ruedi P., The effect of various topical and parenteral agents on the prevention of infection in experimental contaminated wounds, Journal of Trauma - Injury, Infection and Critical Care, 4, 6, pp. 763-783, (1964); Jackson, Douglas W., Intraarticular reaction associated with the use of freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized bone-patella tendon-bone allografts in the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 1, pp. 1-11, (1990); Noyes, Frank R., Biomechanical analysis of human ligament grafts used in knee-ligament repairs and reconstructions, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 66, 3, pp. 344-352, (1984)","","","","","","","","","00351040","","RCORA","10612141","French","Rev.

The ACL and PCL were reconstructed using the patellar tendon and the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons, respectively. Early mobilisation using a continuous-passive-movement machine and active exercises was started on the second day after operation. At a mean follow-up of 39 months no patient reported 'giving way' and all except one had good range of movement. Of the 41 knees, 21 were rated as excellent, 15 good, four fair and one poor. Early reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments and primary repair of the collateral ligaments followed by an aggressive rehabilitation programme are recommended for these young, active patients.","","adult; article; clinical article; exercise; female; follow up; human; joint mobility; knee dislocation; knee ligament; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; priority journal; tissue graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Collateral Ligaments; Dislocations; Exercise Therapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Postoperative Complications; Reoperation; Tendons","","","","","","","Mediguide Orthop, (1992); Green, N.

A prospective study was made of 129 patients following arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL to compare the 2-yr clinical results obtained with two techniques, namely a free patellar tendon (PT) graft or a double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (DLSTG) graft, and fixation with a bioabsorbable in terference screw. All patients were operated by the same surgeon in a random sequence. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of sex, age, interval between injury and reconstruction and sports level. The IKDC form, a KT-1000 arthrometer and the one-leg hop test were employed for clinical evaluation. Residual joint motility was significantly greater (p<0.05) in the DLSTG group, whereas the differences in femoropatellar symptoms, subjective and objective stability and recovery of function were not significant. MRI of 15 patients from each group 3 and 6 mon ths after surgery revealed lower synovial reactivity and less joint effusion in the DLSTG group (p<0.03). It is felt that the clinical results of ACL reconstruction with a DLSTG graft combined with compaction and press-fitting and fixation with bioabsorbable interference screws are comparable with those provided by a PT graft.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Interference screw; Semitendinosus and gracilis","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; athlete; biodegradable implant; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; functional assessment; gracilis muscle; human; joint mobility; knee arthrography; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; priority journal; semitendinous muscle","","","","","","","Traumatic Disorders of the Knee, (1994); Howell, Stephen M., Rationale and endoscopic technique for anatomic placement and rigid fixation of a double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis graft, Techniques in Orthopaedics, 13, 4, pp. 319-328, (1998); Rowden, Neville J., Anterior cruciate ligament graft fixation: Initial comparison of patellar tendon and semitendinosus autografts in young fresh cadavers, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 4, pp. 472-478, (1997); Steiner, Mark E., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Graft Fixation: Comparison of Hamstring and Patellar Tendon Grafts, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 240-247, (1994); Annual Meeting of American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, (1995); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Noyes, Frank R., Biomechanical analysis of human ligament grafts used in knee-ligament repairs and reconstructions, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 66, 3, pp. 344-352, (1984); Marder, Richard A., Prospective evaluation of arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

We followed 59 patients who had had arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL using a central-third patellar-tendon autograft for seven years to assess the long-term effectiveness of recent advances in reconstruction of the ACL. The standard criteria for evaluation of the International Knee Documentation Committee, the Lysholm knee score and measurements using the KT 1000 arthrometer all showed satisfactory results. Deterioration in the clinical performance after seven years was associated with osteoarthritic changes and correlated with chronic ligament injuries and meniscectomy. There were three traumatic and three spontaneous ruptures. We believe that the procedure can be successful, but remain concerned about failure of the graft and osteoarthritis. The results raise questions about the best time to operate and suggest that early surgery may reduce the risk of osteoarthritis.","","flucloxacillin; gentamicin; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; bone screw; female; graft failure; human; intravenous drug administration; knee arthroscopy; ligament injury; major clinical study; male; meniscectomy; osteoarthritis; patella tendon; priority journal; treatment failure; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Screws; Braces; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Middle Aged; Patella; Range of Motion, Articular; Recurrence; Reoperation; Rupture; Rupture, Spontaneous; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Levy, I.

At follow-up after two years, the subjective assessments were normal in 5 cases, nearly normal in 12 and abnormal in 4. No cases of infection nor clinically evident reactive synovitis were observed. CT after 1 year showed that the bone plugs were completely incorporated in the bone tunnels. The gap between the screw and the plug was completely-filled with bone and there was a reactive bone layer around the screw. There was no evidence of lysis at the absorbable implant site. The screws had retained their shape and there were slight signs of resorption along their outer and inner surfaces. MRI provided a more meaningful picture of the position of the tunnels and the intra-articular part of the graft. CT, on the other hand, proved superior through its better demonstration of bone plug incorporation, the bone-screw interface and screw absorption.","Absorbable; Anterior cruciate ligament; Interference screw; Patellar tendon; Polylactic acid","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone screw; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; female; human; ligament surgery; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; priority journal; synovitis; tendon graft","","","","","","","Cooper, Daniel E., The strength of the central third patellar tendon graft.

This study examined the influence of chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency on muscle activation patterns displayed during abrupt deceleration, relative to timing of tibiofemoral shear forces (F(S)) generated during the task. Design. Experimental data were collected for both limbs of 11 chronic functional anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects and 11 matched controls. Methods. Electromyographic, high speed film and ground reaction force data were sampled as subjects landed in single-limb stance on a force platform after receiving a chest level pass and decelerating abruptly. Temporal characteristics of each muscle burst relative to initial foot-ground contact were derived and F(S) were calculated from net joint reaction forces and the patellar tendon force occasioned by the net moments and inertial forces predicted about the knee. Results. Compared to controls, anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects displayed a delay in hamstring activation so that peak hamstring activity was more synchronous with initial contact and with the high F(S) which occurred after initial contact. Conclusions.

Design and Setting: A 2 × 2 mixed-design analysis of variance (group × leg) was applied to the static posture, dynamic balance, and strength data. In addition, Pearson product-moment correlations were calculated to determine the strength of the relationships among the dependent measures. All data were collected in the Motor Control Laboratory at Indiana University. Subjects: The experimental group was composed of 20 individuals who had undergone ACL reconstruction with a patellar tendon autograft. The control group comprised 20 participants with no history of significant orthopaedic injuries to the lower extremities. Measurements: The dependent variables were sway path linear mean for the static condition, dynamic-phase recovery time after perturbation for the dynamic measure, and quadriceps peak torque for strength. Results: We found significant differences between the ACL and control groups on the measures of dynamic-phase duration and peak torque. The static sway variable did not show a significant difference. Conclusions: Evaluation of the postural control system under 2 conditions, static and dynamic, showed differences between the ACL and control groups for the dynamic condition only. These results suggest the presence of independent control mechanisms for the control of static and more dynamic postures. In addition, because there were no differences between the injured and noninjured legs of the ACL group, the theory of a central postural control scheme is supported.","Balance; Posture","","","","","","","","Emerson, R.

METHODS: Twenty cases of chronic instability of knee secondary to rupture of PCL underwent reconstruction of PCL using free autograft of bone-patellar tendon-bone by isometric tibial and femoral attachment through anterior approach of knee. Larson knee function score, patient subjective evaluation and physical testing were used to evaluate the effect of this procedure. RESULTS: In this series, the average point of Larson score was 62 preoperatively. By the period of 6 - 58 month follow-up, the average point was 92. Subjectively 18 cases showed satisfactory results. Lachmann test showed negative results in all cases. The range of motion was 115 degrees on the average. CONCLUSIONS: This method can provide a strong and stable PCL replacement. But the surgical procedure is more difficult than ACL reconstruction. Some factors for a successful operation include evaluation of instability, preparation of graft material, internal fixation of graft, isometric attachment, reconstruction of other structures of knee, and bearing tension of graft.","","adolescent; adult; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; follow up; human; injury; joint instability; knee injury; knee ligament; methodology; middle aged; patella ligament; plastic surgery; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Arthroscopy; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","05295815","","","11829790","Chinese","Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33644875461"

One hundred and thirty-three female and 296 male patients were followed at 38 (21-68) months after the index operation. All the patients were operated on by experienced knee surgeons using patellar tendon autografts and interference screw fixation. At the index operation the median age of the female patients was 23 (16-45) years and the median age of the male patients was 26 (16-47) years. The reconstruction was performed a median of 10 (0-141) and 10 (0-203) months after the injury in women and men respectively. The patients were re-examined by independent observers. At the follow-up, the median Lysholm score was 89 (38-100) points in the female group and 90 (22-100) points in the male group (P=0.015). The IKDC evaluation system, subjective anterior knee pain, subjective evaluation of the results, the knee-walking test and the KT-1000 tests revealed no differences between the groups. The mean (±2 SD) pre-injury Tegner activity level was 8.1 (±1.9) (median 8 (7-10)) in the female group and 8.4 (±1.8) (median 9 (7-10)) in the male group (P=0.003). At the follow-up, the Tegner activitylevel was 6.2 (±3.8) in the female group and 6.8 (±3.6) in the male group (P=0.012). At the follow-up, the Tegner activity level had decreased by 1.9 (±3.8) for the women and 1.6 (±3.3) for the men, as compared with the pre-injury level (n.s.). The difference between the performed and the desired activity level at the follow-up was 1.1 (±3.2) in the female group and 0.9 (±3.0) in the male group (n.s.). In the female group 53/133 (40%) and in the male group 115/296 (39%) returned to the pre-injury activity level (n.s.). The median one-leg-hop quotient was 93 (0-116)% in the female group and 96 (0-130)%. in the male group (P=0.006). Concomitant meniscal injuries prior to the index operation, at the index operation or during the follow-up period were found in 64/133 (48%) women and in 185/ 296 (62%) men (P<0.01). The main conclusion was that the overall results in female and male athletes were comparable two to five years after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Eleven patients (group 1) underwent direct repair of the cruciate ligaments, 6 patients (group 2) underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with hamstring tendons and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reattachment, and 6 patients (group 3) underwent PCL reconstruction with ipsilateral bone-patellar tendon-bone and ACL reconstruction with doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. Average follow-up was 6.9 years (range: 24 months to 19 years). Surgical results were evaluated using the IKDC evaluation form, KT-2000 arthrometer, and Lysholm and Tegner scores. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to compare different surgical procedures. In terms of stability and range of motion, results were less favorable after direct repair and cruciate ligament reattachment. Better results were reported after combined ACL and PCL reconstruction. Average side-to-side total anteroposterior translation as measured by the KT-2000 arthrometer at 20 degrees +/- 5 degrees of knee flexion was 6.67 mm, 3.6 mm, and 3.2 mm in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At final International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation, only 2 group 3 patients achieved a group qualification A, while a group qualification B was achieved by 5 patients (2 patients in group 1, 2 patients in group 2, and 1 patient in group 3). Nine patients in group 1, 4 patients in group 2, and 3 patients in group 3 achieved group qualifications C and D (fair or poor results). Based on these results, we do not recommend reattachment of the cruciate ligaments after knee dislocation for obtaining a stable knee with full range of motion.","","adolescent; adult; article; comparative study; dislocation; female; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; knee injury; male; methodology; middle aged; orthopedic surgery; pathophysiology; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Dislocations; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Procedures; Range of Motion, Articular; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","08997403","","","10626912","English","Am J Knee Surg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033183103"

Methods: A total of 153 sports players were reviewed 70 months (range 39-84 months) after they had anterior cruciate ligaments reconstruction by autologous patellar tendon graft (K. Lambert intra-articular reconstruction) combined with extra-articular tenodesis using iliotibial band (MacIntosh tenodesis). Results: We found all the patients were able to return to their normal active life and 131 atheletes were able to return to full sports activities, while 21 patients were not able to go back to their sports or had to modify their sports activities. The knees were assessed using Lysholm knee score, Shino grading system and clinical examination for anterior drawer, Lachman and pivot shift signs. The mean Lysholm knee score was 94.9 (range 71-100) while Shino grading for 64 knees was very good, for 68 knees good, and 21 knees fair. None of the patients had poor results. Conclusions: Depending on the type and degree of functional instability, we recommend anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by autologous tendon graft and in all cases, extra-articular procedures are required.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Autologous graft; Continuous passive motion; Extra-articular tenodesis; Intra-articular reconstruction","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; athlete; daily life activity; functional assessment; human; knee instability; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; physical activity; sport; surgical approach; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Clancy, William G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using one-third of the patellar ligament, augmented by extra-articular tendon transfers, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 64, 3, pp. 352-359, (1982); Eriksson, Ejnar, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 7, 1, pp. 167-179, (1976); Jones, K.

There were no statistically significant differences in the measured dimensions of the intercondylar notch between 1 week and 1 year postoperatively.

Interference screw fixation is one method used to secure the graft. Bioabsorbable interference screws may offer advantages over metal interference screws. Bioabsorbable screws are made from poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) and are absorbed by the body. This prospective, randomized study compared the safety and efficacy of the PLLA screw with that of the metal cannulated interference screw for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. There were 204 patients randomly assigned to the Bioscrew (Linvatec, Largo, FL) (n = 103) or the metal interference screw (n = 101) groups at four sites. The mean age was 30 years. There were 66 women and 138 men. Mean follow-up was 30 months for Bioscrews and 28 months for metal screws; the average follow-up interval was 2.4 years. The Lysholm mean scores at 4 years for the 32 patients seen at this interval were 95.0 and 97.2 for the Bioscrew and metal screw group, respectively. Ligament laxity comparisons made with an instrumented arthrometer at manual maximum force resulted in side-to-side mean score differences of B = 1.8mm and M = 1.6mm. The Tegner activity level score means were B = 6.1 and M = 5.8. Other variables examined included pain, thigh size, meniscal tests, Lachman's test, range of motion, anterior drawer, pivot shift, patellofemoral crepitus and tenderness, and joint effusion. None of these variables showed a statistically significant difference between groups. No radiographic evidence of osteolytic change or bone resorption around the Bioscrews was observed. There were no complications related to loss of fixation, toxicity, allergenicity, or other evidence of osteolytic or inflammatory reaction. In every assessment between groups there was no difference found. There were 12 PLLA screws that broke during insertion without any adverse effects. The PLLA headless cannulated interference fit screws produce equal results to similarly designed metal screws. © 1999 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.","Bioscrew; Interference fixation screw; Patellar tendon graft; Polylactic acid","metal; polylactic acid; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; device; evaluation; female; human; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; tendon graft","","polylactic acid, 26100-51-6","BioScrew, Linvatec","Linvatec","","","Burks, Robert T., Practical considerations in cruciate graft fixation, Operative Techniques in Orthopaedics, 2, 2, pp. 71-75, (1992); Alm, Anders, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by using the medial third of the patellar ligament.

The interval between the surgery and the examinations ranged from 3 to 36 months (mean, 14.1 months). Biopsy specimens with woven polyester were removed from the anterior midportion of the graft 5 mm in depth from the graft surface. Arthroscopically, all 38 grafts showed thick ligamentous tissues, but some polyester fibers had ruptured in 9 grafts. The transplanted grafts were arthroscopically very similar to normal ACL 12 months after reconstruction. Histologically, a marked inflammatory response to the woven polyester was observed in the first 4 months after the operation, but this decreased with time. Five of 6 grafts obtained 18-36 months postoperatively showed decreased cellularity, with longitudinally oriented fibrous bundles, suggesting approaching ligament maturity. The appearance of the fibroblasts in the grafts varied from patient to patient, with 13 of 37 grafts (35.1%) showing spindling fibroblasts, and 24 grafts (64.9%) oval ones. (The remaining graft consisted of mesenchymal cells). Clinically, postoperative KT 1000 arthrometer measurements showed that the mean injured-to-uninjured difference in anterior knee laxity was 1.7±2.6 mm. There was no chronic synovitis or effusion during the study period. These results suggest that grafts with PT augmented with woven polyester transform arthroscopically and histologically into a structure similar to that of normal ligaments after reconstruction, and may act as a substitute for the ACL. The advantage of woven polyester for the augmentation of PT grafts was that it allowed earlier mobilization and weight-bearing after reconstruction, without adverse effects on graft integrity.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Artificial material; Histology","polyester; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; biopsy; clinical article; female; fibroblast; human; knee arthroscopy; male; patella tendon; rehabilitation medicine; scoring system; surgical technique; tendon graft; tendon reconstruction; treatment outcome","","","KT-1000 arthrometer, Medmetric","Medmetric","","","Amiel, David A., Tendons and ligaments: A morphological and biochemical comparison, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 1, 3, pp. 257-265, (1983); Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anterior cruciate ligament replacement using patellar tendon.

A total of 938 measurements were sequentially collected for 142 patients with the KT-2000 arthrometer. Rehabilitation included immediate knee motion and early weightbearing, light sports at 6 months, and competitive sports at 8 months or later. At a minimum of 2 years after surgery, 121 patients (85%) had normal displacements (less than 3 mm of increase at 134 N), 14 (10%) had 3 to 5.5 mm of increase (partial function), and 7 (5%) had more than 5.5 mm of increase (failed). There was no association found between the initial onset of the abnormal displacements in the 21 knees and either the amount of time after surgery or the rehabilitation program. Six of the seven grafts that failed did so in the 1st postoperative year. Serial displacement measurements allow early detection of graft stretching and subsequent modification of rehabilitation or delay in return to strenuous activities. These measurements showed that the rehabilitation program used in this study was not itself injurious and resulted in an acceptable failure rate of 5%.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; exercise; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; joint stability; knee radiography; knee surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; physical activity; priority journal; tendon graft; weight bearing","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison of clinical and radiological parameters with two arthroscopic techniques for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 1, pp. 2-8, (1995); Arciero, Robert A., Single versus two-incision arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 12, 4, pp. 462-469, (1996); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Barber-Westin, Sue D., The effect of rehabilitation and return to activity on anterior-posterior knee displacements after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 264-270, (1993); Barber-Westin, Sue D., A rigorous comparison between the sexes of results and complications after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 25, 4, pp. 514-526, (1997); Blackburn, J.

Bone patellar tendon-bone and the hamstring tendon generally have been used. In the present study, we describe an alternative graft, the quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft, by using arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Methods: From March of 1996 through March of 1997, a quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft was used in 12 patients with ACL injuries. Results: After 15 to 24 months of follow-up, the clinical outcome for those patients with this graft have been encouraging. Ten patients could return to the same or a higher level of preinjury sports activity. According to the International Knee Documentation Committee rating system, 10 of the 12 patients had normal or nearly normal ratings. Recovery of quadriceps muscle strength to 80% of the normal knee was achieved in 11 patients in 1 year. Conclusion: The advantages of the quadriceps tendon graft include the following: the graft is larger and stronger than the patellar tendon; morbidity of harvest technique and donor site is less than that of patellar tendon graft; there is little quadriceps inhibition after quadriceps harvest; there is quicker return to sports activities with aggressive rehabilitation. A quadriceps tendon-patellar autograft is a reasonable alternative to ACL reconstruction in patients who are not suitable for either a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Quadriceps tendon autograft","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; clinical article; female; hamstring; human; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; knee ligament injury; ligament surgery; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; physical activity; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; sport; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Daniel, Dale M., Fate of the ACL-injured Patient: A Prospective Outcome Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 632-644, (1994); Hefti, E., Evaluation of knee ligament injuries with the IKDC form, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 1, 3-4, pp. 226-234, (1993); Olson, Eric J., Clinical use of fresh, frozen soft tissue allografts, Orthopedics, 15, 10, pp. 1225-1232, (1992); Blauth, Walter, 2-strip substitution-plasty of the anterior cruciate ligament with the quadriceps tendon, Unfallheilkunde, 87, 2, pp. 45-51, (1984); Stäubli, Hans Ulrich, Quadriceps tendon and patellar ligament: Cryosectional anatomy and structural properties in young adults, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 4, 2, pp. 100-110, (1996); Harris, Norman Lindsay, Central quadriceps tendon for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Special emphasis was placed on evaluating the donor site. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patellar tendon was performed to evaluate the reconstitution after harvesting its central third. Examinations of knee-walking ability and assessments of anterior knee sensitivity were made in order to evaluate donor-site discomfort and the function of infrapatellar nerves. Seventy-two consecutive patients were included in the study; group A comprised 35 patients and group B, 37 patients. At the 2-year follow-up, the Tegner activity level, the Lysholm score, and the IKDC evaluation system showed no significant differences between groups A and B. The median loss of normal anterior knee sensitivity was 16 cm2 (range, 0 to 200 cm2) in group A and 0 cm2 (range, 0 to 285 cm2) in group B (P = .20). In group A 20% of the patients and in group B 58% had normal sensitivity (P < .01). MRI showed that the donor-site gap (area corresponding to non-tendinous-like tissue signal) was 5 mm (range, 0 to 9 mm) in group A and 2 mm (range, 0 to 5 mm) in group B(P < .0001). At 2-year follow-up, the subcutaneous graft-harvesting technique resulted in less disturbance of anterior knee sensitivity and a smaller donor-site gap than the traditional technique. © 1999 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.","Anterior cruciate; Donor-site; Harvesting technique; Magnetic resonance imaging; Patellar ligament","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; donor site; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; nerve function; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; saphenous nerve; surgical technique; tendon graft; walking","","","","","Centrum för idrottsforskning, CIF","Supported by grants from the Research and Development Department of Northern Älvsborg and the Swedish National Centre for Research in Sports.","Breitfuss, H., The tendon defect after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the midthird patellar tendon-a problem for the patellofemoral joint?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 194-198, (1996); Chambers, G.

All skiers underwent knee ligament examinations before entering the study. The participants were divided into three groups based on whether they had never had an anterior cruciate ligament injury (N = 4748), were unilaterally deficient of the ligament (N = 138), or had undergone a unilateral reconstruction of the ligament at least 1 year before (N = 274). The rates of knee injuries requiring evaluation by a physician or time off work were calculated. The results of the reconstructed knees were further evaluated to determine whether ligament repair with semitendinosus/gracilis or patellar tendon autograft had a higher injury rate. Compared with knees with intact anterior cruciate ligaments, ligament- deficient knees had a 6.2-times higher rate of injuries, and knees in which the ligament had been reconstructed had a 3.1-times higher rate. The differences between each of the three groups were significant. Injuries to ligament-intact knees were less severe, with 13% requiring surgery, while 39% of the injuries in the ligament-deficient and 41% of the injuries in the reconstructed-ligament knees required surgery. The rates of injury for the graff types were not significantly different, but skiers with a semitendinosus/gracilis tendon autograft were significantly more likely to rupture their graff than skiers with a patellar tendon autograft.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; controlled study; female; gracilis muscle; human; injury scale; knee arthroplasty; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; postoperative period; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; skiing; tendon graft","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Failure strengths of femur-graft-tibia preparations held by absorbable screws were lower initially but at no time were they statistically different to those held by metal screws. By 4 weeks, fibrous union between the graft tendon and tunnel wall led to no difference in failure strength if the screw was present or removed before measurement. Histologically, ossifie incorporation of the graft bone was not evident until 6 weeks. A mild tissue reaction occurred around the absorbable screw.

Thirty-seven consecutive patients with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries undergoing elective reconstruction of the ligament were included in the study. They were aged 27 (range 14-50) years. The graft was harvested through two 25-mm vertical incisions with the aim of protecting the infrapatellar nerve and sparing the paratenon. The tendon defect was left open. The patients underwent MRI evaluation at 6 weeks, 6 months and 27 months postoperatively. A final clinical follow-up was made 25 (range 23-29) months postoperatively. MRI demonstrated that the donor-site gap, i.e. the area corresponding to a pathological non-tendinous-like tissue signal, was 9 (range 4-18) mm at 6 weeks, 5 (range 2-14) mm at 6 months and 2 (range 0-5) mm at 27 months.

Between 1991 and 1994, 635 patients were operated on using patellar tendon autografts and interference screw fixation. Of these, 604 (95.1%) patients (403 male and 201 female) were re-examined by independent observers at the final follow-up 38 (range 21-68) months post-operatively. The Lysholm score was 85 (range 14-100) points and the Tegner activity level was 6 (range 1-10). Using the IKDC score, 206 patients (34.1%) were classified as normal, 244 (40.4%) as nearly normal, 122 (20.2%) as abnormal and 32 (5.3%) as severely abnormal. In patients with an uninjured contralateral knee (n = 527), the KT-1000 revealed a total side-to-side difference of 1.5 (range -7-11) mm, and 384/527 (72.9%) had a side-to-side difference of ≤ 3 mm. The one-leg-hop test was 95% (range 0%-167%). One or more complications impeding rehabilitation were recorded in 184/604 patients (30.5%). The most common was an extension deficit (> 5°), in 81 patients (13.4%). During the period until the final follow-up, 196 re-operations were performed in 161/604 (26.7%) patients. More than one re-operation was required in 27 patients. Shaving and anterior scar resection due to extension deficit were the most common procedures performed (on 65 occasions). Moderate to severe subjective anterior knee pain related to activity, walking up and down stairs, and sitting with the knee flexed was found in 203/604 patients (33.6%). The median loss of anterior knee sensitivity was 16 (range 0-288) cm2. Patients with a full range of motion had less anterior knee pain than patients with isolated flexion or extension deficits, or combined flexion and extension deficits (P < 0.05, P = 0.08 and P < 0.001, respectively). Patients with a full range of motion had less anterior knee pain than patients with extension deficits (with and without flexion deficits) (P < 0.001). Patients with a full range of motion and a minimal loss (≤ 4 cm2) of anterior knee sensitivity had significantly (P < 0.01) less subjective anterior knee pain than patients who did not fulfil these criteria. A considerable number of complications hindering the rehabilitation and conditions requiring additional surgery until the final follow-up were recorded. Anterior knee pain and problems with knee-walking were correlated with the loss of range of motion and anterior knee sensitivity.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior knee pain; Arthroscopy; Complication; Donor site","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; endoscopy; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; reoperation; rupture; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Endoscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Range of Motion, Articular; Reoperation; Rupture","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Berg, P., A lateral skin incision reduces peripatellar dysaesthesia after knee surgery, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 73, 3, pp. 374-376, (1991); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

The follow-up examination was performed by independent observers at a median of 38 (21-68) months after the index operation. At the follow-up, the Lysholm score was 86 (14-100) points, the Lysholm instability subscore was 22 (0-25) points and the Lysholm pain subscore was 19 (0-25) points. The Tegner activity level was 6 (1-10). The one-leg-hop test was 91 (0-167)% of the non-injured knee. The difference in the anterior side-to-side laxity as measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer at 89 Newton (N) was 1.5 (-5-13) mm and the total KT-1000 side-to-side difference at 89 N was 2 (-7-11) mm. Using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation system, 177 (33.6%) patients were classified as normal (group A), 211 (40%) as nearly normal (group B), 109 (20.7%) as abnormal (group C) and 30 (5.7%) as severely abnormal (group D). The highest correlation coefficients were recorded between the IKDC evaluation system and the Lysholm score (p = 0.66), the patients' subjective evaluation (p = 0.53), the Tegner activity level (p = 0.34), all the laxity tests (p > or = 0.34) and the one-leg-hop test (p = 0.28). The resumption of sporting activities and work as evaluated by the Tegner activity level correlated with the patients' subjective evaluation (p = 0.34) but did not correlate with the laxity tests, i.e., the manual Lachman test (p = -0.06) and the total and anterior KT-1000 tests (p = -0.06). Furthermore, none of the laxity tests correlated with the functional tests or the patients' subjective evaluation. We conclude that the IKDC evaluation system is a reliable and useful tool for evaluating the post-operative outcome after an ACL reconstruction.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; clinical trial; endoscopy; female; follow up; human; joint instability; knee injury; male; middle aged; nonparametric test; pathophysiology; sport injury; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Athletic Injuries; Endoscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Statistics, Nonparametric; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","Acknowledgements This study was supported by grants from the Research and Development Department of Northern Älvsborg.","","N.

This is because the described techniques are either technically difficult or depend on the experience of the performer and are not standardized. The purpose of this prospective analysis on ACL intact, ACL deficient and ACL reconstructed knees was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of prone ultrasonographic Lachman testing with KT-1000 measurements in the same study population. Our technique is based on a prone position of the patient. The thigh lies on the table surface such that the patella has no contact. The lower leg is placed on a roll in the ankle area and flexed to 30 degrees . The transducer (5 MHz) is positioned over the medial aspect of the popliteal fossa to visualize the femoral condyle as well as the tibial head. Under ultrasound control the lower leg is manually lifted as far the thigh stays in contact with the surface defining the start position. The lower leg is then released and drawn by gravity into the anterior drawer position, the final position. The distance between the posterior tangent from the medial femoral condyle to the medial tibial plateau was registered by three independent ultrasound measurements of the injured knee. The uninvolved opposite knee served as an internal control. The same procedure was done using a KT-1000 device (89 and 133 Newton and manual maximum force). The patients were split into two groups: acute injury (A), and (B) 6 months following ACL repair with a patellar tendon graft. All patients then underwent arthroscopy. In group A with acute ACL lesions the anterior drawer resulted in 14.1 mm (+/- 3.5) and was significantly (P < 0.001) different from the contralateral knee (7.7 mm +/- 2.9). The KT 1000 showed a comparable difference with 14.4 mm (+/- 3.9) for the injured knee and 8.3 mm (+/- 3.4) for the uninjured (P < 0.001). Sonometrically, group B patients showed no clear difference between the repaired (9.9 mm +/- 2.7) knee and its control (8.1 mm +/- 2.5). This was found for the KT-1000 results as well. The results derived from the ultrasound evaluation of the anterior drawer correlated well with those from the KT-1000 (r = 0.46). Based on a minimum intra-individual difference of 5 mm in the ultrasound measured anterior drawer, the sensitivity of the test in group A resulted in 0.96, and the specificity in 0.98. The described technique is reproducible, painless and easy to perform in order to evaluate acute ACL tears using any commercially available ultrasound device. The reproducibility is similar to the KT-1000 device. We recommend this technique for use in cases of acute ACL tears as well as in the follow-up of ACL repair.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; body posture; clinical trial; echography; gravity; human; injury; joint instability; knee injury; methodology; nonparametric test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prospective study; radiography; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Gravitation; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Prone Position; Prospective Studies; Statistics, Nonparametric; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","F.

We studied four patients, average age 34.2 years (range 32-36 years). The mean time between the ACL reconstruction and the study examination was 56.2 months (range 5-108 months). All patients underwent a second-look arthroscopy for meniscal injuries, cyclops lesions, or adhesions. Five patients with a normal ACL served as a control group before we performed an arthroscopic meniscectomy. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was measured using fine wire electrodes under two different testing conditions. No unequivocal EMG activity could be detected in the ACL-reconstructed knees when we pulled on the graft or in the controls. Three of four patients and all controls felt pain when we touched the graft or normal ACL or applied strain on it with the hook. In conclusion, the ACL autograft presents a noxious sensory innervation, the Lachman test maneuver stimulates a reflex arc with hamstrings activation, and an unequivocal ligament-muscle reflex arc from the graft to the hamstring muscle group could not be demonstrated.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthralgia; arthroscopy; article; case report; controlled study; electromyography; female; hamstring; human; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; priority journal; reflex arc; sensory nerve; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Electrodes; Electromyography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Mechanoreceptors; Muscle, Skeletal; Patella; Reflex; Tendons; Time Factors","","","","","","","Barrack, Robert L., Knee joint proprioception revisited, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 3, 1, pp. 18-42, (1994); Biedert, Roland Manfred, Occurrence of free nerve endings in the soft tissue of the knee joint.

Subjectively, the Lysholm score was not different among the groups. The Lachman test indicated a trend of less negative grade in the ST men's group than that in the BTB men's group. On the patellofemoral grinding test, only women patients of both groups showed pain, with less positive crepitation in the ST group than in the BTB group. KT measurements at manual maximum showed more patients with more than 5 mm differences in the ST group than in the BTB group. The results of this study suggest that aggressive early rehabilitation after the ACL reconstruction using the semitendinosus (and gracilis) tendon has more risk of residual laxity than with the BTB.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; female; gracilis muscle; human; joint laxity; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Early Ambulation; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Pain, Postoperative; Postoperative Care; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendon Transfer; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Clancy, William G., Anterior and posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in rhesus monkeys.

Although the patellar tendon has traditionally been the gold standard graft choice for reconstruction, the hamstring tendon has now also become a popular graft choice because its use reduces postoperative anterior knee pain and donor site morbidity. From March 1996 to December 1996, we used hamstring tendon grafts for the surgical reconstruction of the ACL in 26 patients. All patients were followed and evaluated for an average of 28 months. Return to the same or higher level of pre-injury sports activity was achieved in 22 of the 26 patients (85%). Overall outcome as measured by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) rating was normal or nearly normal in 23 of the 26 patients (88%). The overall 100-point Subjective Knee Score was 87.4. Cybex dynamometer testing showed that quadriceps strength of the operated knee recovered to more than 80% of the normal knee in 24 of 26 patients (92%). One patient had hamstring muscle power limitation. For the assessment of tunnel expansion after ACL reconstruction, the diameter of the bone tunnel was measured and compared with the original reamed diameter. Enlargement of at least 2 mm was found in 5 femoral tunnels (19%) and in 3 tibial tunnels (12%). In this report, we describe the surgical technique of arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with autograft of quadruple hamstring tendons, including double loops of semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. A new fixation method was used in which Mersilene tape and a washer were applied at the femoral side and sutures of tendons to a screw at the tibial side. This technique is easy to learn and does not require any specific fixation device. The clinical results at a minimum 2-year follow-up with this technique were satisfactory in 88% of patients.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Hamstring tendons autograft","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; dynamometry; female; follow up; gracilis muscle; hamstring; human; knee arthroscopy; ligament surgery; male; mobilization; patella tendon; quadriceps femoris muscle; semitendinous muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment indication; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10225536","","JOTSE","","English","J.

Material and methods 138 patients of a mean age of 27,8 ± 8,5 years had been operated. Delay between injury and operation was 4 ± 4,8 years. The surgical 'Mac Injones' procedure used a free autologous patellar tendon graft with a bone-to-bone fixation, supplemented by a lateral extra- articular plasty using a strip of quadriceps tendon as a direct prolongation of the graft of the patellar tendon and patella itself. A rehabilitation program aimed to an early recovery of a complete range of motion. Anterior laxity had been measured before and after operation using two instrumented methods, KT-1000 and stressradiography (at 20°of flexion with a 9 kg load applied at the distal part of the thigh) with measurements of the displacement in medial and lateral compartments. Tunnel positioning was appreciated radiologically. Function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score (I.K.D.C.). Results Elongation of the reconstructed ligament occurred mainly during the first 6 month, but was independent from early full range of motion recovery. Laxity was stabilized after one year. The final laxity gain of the medial compartment was 62 per cent and for the lateral compartment 77 per cent. The pivot shift test was negative in 66 per cent, grade 2 in 4 per cent, grade 1 in 30 per cent. Functional results were excellent and good (A and B) in 60,4 per cent and 76,7 per cent returned to sports activity. 12 reconstructed ligaments reruptured. Arthritis was the cause of poor results in other cases (13,8 per cent). Discussion Lateral extra-articular plasty is unable to better control translation of the medial compartment than isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but laxity of the lateral compartment was minimized and the pivot shift test also. Incorrect position of the anterior cruciate ligament was correlated with poor results. Conclusion This documented study on laxity of the two compartments confirms the interest of each type of reconstruction, in particular extra-articular plasty when made with quadriceps tendon and so doing, preserving the iliotibial-band for the control of varus stability.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; follow up; human; knee arthritis; knee arthroplasty; knee instability; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; postoperative complication; prospective study; surgical technique; adolescent; arthritis; autotransplantation; chronic disease; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; knee injury; mechanical stress; middle aged; patella ligament; pathophysiology; physiology; physiotherapy; recurrent disease; rupture; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthritis; Chronic Disease; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Physical Therapy Modalities; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Recurrence; Rupture; Stress, Mechanical; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); These Med, (1995); Acta Radiol Diagn Stockh, (1968); Almekinders, Louis C., Post-operative problems following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 2, pp. 78-82, (1995); Anderson, Allen F., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons Augmented by the Losee Iliotibial Band Tenodesis: A Long-term Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 620-626, (1994); Cahiers D Enseignement De La Sofcot, (1987); Barber-Westin, Sue D., The effect of rehabilitation and return to activity on anterior-posterior knee displacements after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 264-270, (1993); J Bone Joint Surg Br, (1984); Beaufils, Phillippe, Meniscal injury in the plastic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

In order to clarify the morbidity resulting from the graft harvest alone, we evaluated those patients who had transplantat harvest from the opposite knee. Between 1990 and 1995 a central bone-tendon- bone graft has been taken from the contralateral uninjured knee in 37 patients, in 22 cases for anterior and in 15 cases for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. 27 patients were clinically (IKDC Score), isokinetically and radiologically followed up in an average of 25,3 months after the operation (range: 9-73 months). 21 patients were classified into IKDC group A. Except of one patient with an extension deficit of 5°all others showed normal range of motion. Only 5 of 27 patients expressed minimal knee pain during vigorous activities. Three of them reported about weather sensitivity in addition. These 6 patients were ranked in group B. No patient was classified into IKDC group C or D. The isokinetic examination showed a normal level of quadriceps strength. At final followup, the technique of Blackburne and Peel was used to assess patellar height. There was no radiographic evidence of patella contracture or baja. According to our results taking the autogenous CBTB graft used for cruciate ligament reconstruction leads to no serious morbidity.","CBTB graft; Cruciate ligament; Morbidity; Reconstruction","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical article; human; joint mobility; knee function; knee injury; knee radiography; knee surgery; ligament injury; morbidity; muscle strength; patella; treatment outcome; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; female; follow up; injury; knee ligament; male; middle aged; muscle isometric contraction; physiology; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; radiography; tendon transfer; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Pain, Postoperative; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Postoperative Complications; Tendon Transfer","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Blackburn, J.

The graft can be inserted either using two tunnels and a lateral femoral incision or with a femoral half tunnel drilled from the joint, thus avoiding the lateral incision. Advantages of the single-incision technique in the early rehabilitation period have been claimed. 40 patients with ACL deficiency were included in a prospective randomized trial comparing single and two-incision technique with a follow-up period of 4 years. Preoperative data did not show any significant difference between the two groups. At follow-up no differences were observed with respect to complications or the progress of rehabilitation. Evaluation after 1 and 4 years according to the IKDC form revealed good to excellent results in 70% of all patients. The Tegner-score increased significantly, however most patients did not regain their former activity level. ACL-reconstruction reduced anterior translation of the knee significantly at 6 months follow-up. However, we observed a slight increase of anterior translation after 1 and 4 years in both groups; stability was comparable in both groups at all time periods. We conclude that an arthroscopic single incision technique has no advantage compared to a mini-open two-incision technique for ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft in terms of subjective or objective parameters.","ACL; Arthroscopic ACL replacement; IKDC; Prospective randomized study","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; follow up; human; incision; ligament surgery; surgical technique; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopes; Endoscopes; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Prospective Studies; Tendon Transfer; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Bosch, Ulrich, Healing of the patellar tendon autograft after posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction - A process of ligamentization?

Over a twelve month period, seven patients presented to us with chronic medial knee instability. Four of these had a complete tear of the MCL as an isolated injury and three had an associated cruciate injury, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in two patients and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in one patient. Patients with a cruciate injury underwent arthroscopic reconstruction using patellar tendon graft and had six months of intensive physiotherapy. The follow up consisted of a questionnaire and physical examination. They were graded on the IKDC and Lysholm knee scoring scales. The average duration of follow up was 31 months. We report good to excellent results on all our patients on the Lysholm scale and in spite of three patients having their knees recorded as abnormal on the IKDC scale, all of them were satisfied, had no pain or residual instability and were back to sporting activities without any external support. While reviewing the literature, we did not come across proximal advancement of the MCL in isolation as performed by us as treatment for chronic medial knee instability though it has been performed previously with a different operative technique or in association with more extensive surgical intervention. Thus, in those few patients who require surgical intervention for this problem, we advocate this technique as a simple and reliable method for treating chronic medial knee instability.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; clinical article; female; human; knee instability; knee ligament; male; patella tendon; physical examination; physiotherapy; priority journal; questionnaire; sport; surgical technique; tendon graft","","","","","","","Surgery of the Knee, (1993); Bartel, Donald L., Surgical repositioning of the medical collateral ligament.

One hundred three patients were evaluated (mean followup, 36 months; range, 24 to 55). There were significant improvements in physical examination test results (Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot shift) postoperatively, and 94 patients (91%) had negative pivot shift results. KT-1000 arthrometric testing showed a significant reduction in manual maximum anterior translation and side-to- side differences at followup. Good range of motion was achieved. Patients with asymmetric prone heel heights usually had hyperextension in the contralateral knee. Functional tests showed 4% to 6% differences in side-to- side comparisons for a timed single-legged hop, single-legged hop for distance, and vertical jump. Postoperatively, the results of the Tegner scale were similar to preinjury scores. The mean results of the Hospital for Special Surgery scale (90), Lysholm score (89), and Noyes sport function score (90) were all excellent or good. Only 5 patients (5%) required reoperations for flexion contractures. Ninety-six patients (93%) reported they were 'mostly' or 'completely' satisfied, and 98 (95%) would recommend the procedure to others. These results demonstrated encouraging outcome using this single-incision technique.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; brace; endoscopic surgery; female; flexion contracture; follow up; function test; human; incision; joint characteristics and functions; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; patient satisfaction; physical examination; physiotherapy; priority journal; rating scale; surgical technique; tendon graft","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison of clinical and radiological parameters with two arthroscopic techniques for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 1, pp. 2-8, (1995); Almekinders, Louis C., Post-operative problems following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 2, pp. 78-82, (1995); Knee Surgery, (1994); Anderson, Allen F., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons Augmented by the Losee Iliotibial Band Tenodesis: A Long-term Study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 5, pp. 620-626, (1994); Andersson, Christer A., Treatment of acute isolated and combined ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament: A long-term follow-up study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 7-12, (1992); Andersson, Christer A., Knee function after surgical or nonsurgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament: A randomized study with a long-term follow-up period, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 264, pp. 255-263, (1991); Andersson, Christer A., Surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Patients were assigned to have twisted or nontwisted autografts based on the date of ACL reconstruction. The control group was comprised of 60 patients without graft twist, and the twist group was comprised of 60 patients who had 90 degrees of external twist applied to the graft prior to tibial fixation to reproduce the anatomic external twist of the native ACL. The average patient age was 28.8 years for the control group and 28.3 years for the twist group. Males accounted for 68% of the control patients and 73% of the twist patients. Meniscal tears were present in 45% of control and 52% of twist patients. Reconstructions were performed using an endoscopic, single-incision technique with interference screw fixation in the femur. Follow-up examination with KT-2000 arthrometry was performed when patients were within 10% of strength of the uninjured leg by isokinetic testing. KT-2000 testing at 30 lb revealed a mean side-to-side difference for reconstructed versus noninvolved knees of 1.06 for control patients and 1.08 for twist patients. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. All but three control and two twist patients had a Lachman and an anterior drawer examination graded as 0 to 1+. This difference also was not statistically significant. There were no clinical failures in either group. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference between groups clinically or by arthrometry when comparing tibial fixation with an interference fit screw versus suture fixation to a unicortical post. These results indicate that pretwisting the patellar tendon autograft in ACL reconstruction has no significant short-term effect on knee laxity as determined by instrumented testing or clinical examination.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; bone screw; bone transplantation; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; endoscopy; female; human; injury; joint instability; knee; knee injury; longitudinal study; male; methodology; pathophysiology; tendon; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Screws; Bone Transplantation; Endoscopy; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","08997403","","","9533048","English","Am J Knee Surg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032324893"

The migration of the bone blocks was examined with radiostereometric analysis immediately postoperatively and after 3 and 12 months. The median migration of the bone blocks in the femur was 0.4 mm and in the tibia 0.4 mm. Clinical examination was undertaken preoperatively and one year postoperatively. We conclude that the use of interference screws seems to be a reliable method for fixation in anterior cruciate reconstruction and that healing of the bone blocks occurs during the first three postoperative months. © Munksgaard, 1998.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bone healing; Graft fixation; Interference screw; Radiostereometric analysis","tantalum; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone screw; bone transplantation; chronic disease; female; follow up; foreign body; human; injury; instrumentation; male; methodology; photography; radiography; rupture; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Screws; Bone Transplantation; Chronic Disease; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Foreign-Body Migration; Humans; Male; Photogrammetry; Rupture; Tantalum; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","Tantalum, 7440-25-7","","","","","Burnett, Quinter M., Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: Historical overview, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 16, 1, pp. 143-157, (1985); Friedman, Marc J., Autogeneic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) anterior reconstruction of the knee: A review, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, NO. 196, pp. 9-14, (1985); Jones, K.

The distal part of the graft was fixed in a tunnel running from the centre of the anatomical tibial attachment of the ACL to the place where the bone block of the graft was removed from the tibial tubercle. A rehabilitation programme with accelerated weight-bearing postoperatively without external protection was followed. Evaluation consisting of function and stability tests, activity level and Lysholm's subjective function score took place an average of 26 months postoperatively; 35 of 50 patients had an additional evaluation monthly for 1 year and 6 monthly after 1 year. The stability tested manually after an average of 26 months post-operatively was good in 45 patients; 5 of them had a positive Pivot shift test (one 1+, two 2+, two 3+). Only 2 of these patients complained of giving way of the knee. All patients regained good knee function. The average postoperative Lysholm score was 85 (SD 14.5) and the subjective stability of the knee was described as 'good' in 41 patients, and 'poor' in 9. The objective stability was good in 7 of these 9 patients. The mean Tegner score was 6.5 (SD 1.9). The mean time to resuming activities was 5.4 weeks for full weight-bearing, 10 weeks for running, 13.5 weeks for going back to work and 6 months for returning to previous sports. In the group of 35 patients who underwent an additional evaluation, no change in manual stability was found during observation except for 3 of them. No patellar ruptures were seen. The operation technique used in this study appears to allow accelerated knee rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction.","Accelerated weight-bearing; Anterior cruciate ligament; Instability; Knee; Reconstruction","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; femur; follow up; human; joint instability; knee; male; methodology; pathophysiology; physiology; plastic surgery; technique; tibia; time; weight bearing; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Methods; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tibia; Time Factors; Weight-Bearing","","","","","","","Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

The tendons of the first group showed compact parallel fibres with no definitive separation of their bundles and areas of disorganized collagen matrix. Tendons were surrounded by trabecular lamellar bone haphazardly arranged. The tendons of the second, third and fourth groups looked more like normal tendon. The trabecular bone surrounding the tendons formed a tunnel.

Thirty-two patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction with patellar tendons augmented by woven polyester underwent physical and radiographic examinations postoperatively. The interval between surgery and examination ranged from 60 to 91 months with a mean of 68.9 months. The clinical results investigated included the total Lysholm score, the injured-to-uninjured difference in anterior knee laxity from KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, and range of motion. The width of the tibial bone tunnels was increased by a mean of 2.6 +/- 1.5 mm in the antero-posterior view, and by a mean of 2.7 +/- 1.4 mm in the lateral view. Eighteen patients had tunnel enlargements of less than 3 mm, and 14 patients had enlargements of 3 mm or more. The clinical results for patients with tunnel enlargements of less than 3 mm were compared with those for patients with tunnel enlargements of 3 mm or more.

This prospective study assessed the incidence and nature of notch regrowth following initial ACL reconstruction. The study population was comprised of 36 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a patellar tendon-bone autograft. A 3- to 5-mm notchplasty was performed in all patients, and an intraoperative radiograph was taken confirming proper tunnel placement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed the first week following surgery and again at 6 months. The MRIs were reviewed by two skeletal radiologists to evaluate postoperative notch and graft changes. Of the 36 study patients, 28 (78%) knees showed no evidence of graft impingement as defined by graft indentation and intra-substance edema. The MRIs of 8 (22%) patients showed evidence of graft impingement. Four patients had clinical signs of graft impingement, namely persistent effusion or lack of full extension. Arthroscopically, 3 of these patients demonstrated graft encroachment and impingement by fibrocartilage with areas of immature bone. These results indicate that graft impingement from regrowth of the notch is a clinically relevant phenomenon that could potentially result in late graft demise in the ACL-reconstructed knee.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; bone transplantation; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative complication; prospective study; tendon; time; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Transplantation; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendons; Time Factors; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","08997403","","","9586736","English","Am J Knee Surg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032020746"

All operations were performed by the same surgeon. 62% of the patients had undergone medial or meniscectomy, 10% had both menisci removed, and 10% had medial or lateral meniscal repair. 7 patients presented evidence of moderately severe arthritic change in the injured knee prior to surgery. Other 13 patients had chondromalacia or early arthritic changes. Subjects undergoing repair of other ligaments were excluded. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by a clinical examination and a questionnaire, both were repeated at follow-up. For subjective and objective data we used the Lysholm-score, IKDC evaluation form and Tegner activity scale. Subjectively none of the patients had any complaints of instability with daily activities. 18 patients were able to return to recreational sport and 14 to competitive sports. All patients proved applicable to their previous occupations. Clinical examination demonstrated that 6% had less than a 1+Lachman test: 92% had a negative pivot shift. The incidence of patellofemoral pain was 5%. Loss of terminal extension up to 5°was noted in 2, while 4 had loss of terminal flexion (>120°). Good to excellent results were reported in 95% according to Lysholm score, while in IKDC score the food and excellent results with its 65% were apparently lesser.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Bone-tendon-bone patellar-tendon autograft; Clinical investigation; Reconstruction","anterior cruciate ligament; arthritis; arthroscopic surgery; article; autograft; chondromalacia; female; follow up; human; knee arthroscopy; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; meniscectomy; pain; patella tendon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","04734378","","OTPTA","","Bulgarian","Ortop.

But there are very few verified data about the influence of rupture and operation on the gait of a patient. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the rehabilitation of a group of patients with patellar tendon autograft reconstructed knees by means of gait parameters in the first postoperative year. Gate analysis was performed during level walking on 26 patients with a patellar tendon autograft reconstructed knee 8, 11, 26 and 52 weeks post operation. The equipment included an optoelectronic system for recording the kinematics of gait (PRIMAS, Delft, NL) and two KISTLER force plates camouflaged under a 12-m walkway for measuring the ground reaction forces. For the purpose of evaluation and comparison with normal controls (n = 30) quantitative parameters were derived from the knee joint motion, in the horizontal ground reaction force and the moment acting on the knee joint. Results: Differences in important gait parameters between patient group and controls persisted up to 52 weeks after the operation. Only a minority of the subjects (31%) showed results comparable to the controls. Values obtained from the kinematics of the flexion-extension-motion of the knee joint in midstance are especially suitable for diagnosis because the corresponding parameter shows significant relations with all other parameters of evaluation (0,46 ≤ r ≤ 0,59). Moreover, the patients demonstrated significant reductions in knee moments. The deficiencies of external flexion moments during the first part of the stance phase were diminished relatively quickly after the operation. However, the external extension moments during the second part of the stance phase differed from the controls by a significance of ≤ 1% even 52 weeks post operation. Conclusions: Gait analysis represents an effective method for evaluating the rehabilitation of patients who have an ACL reconstructed knee. The reduced extension moment in the second part of the stance phase is the main reason for reduced flexion-extension-motion in midstance. From therapeutical stand point it is recommended to get good training with special exercises for knee joint extension in midstance as soon as possible after the operation.","Biomechanics; Gait analysis; Patellar tendon autograft reconstruction; Rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; electronics; follow up; gait; human; knee function; ligament surgery; tendon graft","","","PRIMAS","","","","Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthrometric Results of Arthroscopically Assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction using Autograft Patellar Tendon Substitution, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 2, pp. 179-185, (1995); Berchuck, Matthew, Gait adaptations by patients who have a deficient anterior cruciate ligament, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 72, 6, pp. 871-877, (1990); Med Orth Tech, (1994); Dtsch Z Sportmed, (1993); Dt Zeitschrift F Sportmed, (1992); Fu, Freddie H., Current concepts for rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 15, 6, pp. 270-278, (1992); Gangbildanalyse Stand Der Metechnik Und Bedeutung Fur Die Orthopadie Technik, (1991); Hehl, Gerhard, Isokinetic muscle training with high motion velocities in rehabilitation after operative treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament, Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und Ihre Grenzgebiete, 133, 4, pp. 306-310, (1995); Orthop Praxis, (1995); Kowalk, David L., Quantitative analysis of the measuring capabilities of the KT-1000 knee ligament arthrometer, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 5, pp. 744-747, (1993)","","","Georg Thieme Verlag iaorl@iaorl.org","","","","","","09406689","","PMRKE","","German","Phys.

The purposes were to determine if differences existed in results between patients with acute and chronic ACL ruptures, and if a progressive rehabilitation program could safely return patients to sports activities early without compromising knee stability. Forty-two patients (84%) returned for follow-up a mean of 31 months postoperatively. Twenty-one patients had acute ruptures, and 21, chronic ruptures. A progressive rehabilitation program was used by 28 patients (67%) who met strict criteria, which allowed early return to running and sports activities. The results were rated with the Cincinnati Knee Rating System. We found no effect of either injury chronicity or time to return to activity for 21 factors, including anterior-posterior displacement, patellofemoral crepitus, range of knee motion, quadriceps muscle strength, symptoms, functional limitations, or the patient rating of outcome. Using arthrometer and pivot-shift test data, 30 knees (71%) had a functional reconstruction; 8 knees (19%) had partial function; and 4 knees (10%) failed. Patients expressed satisfaction with the operation as follows: 23 (55%) rated their overall knee condition as normal; 16 (38%), very good; and 3 (7%), good.

Fifty-four patients (mean age, 30 years) were assigned randomly to the home based program (27 patients) or the clinic based program (27 patients). The home based schedule featured six physical therapy visits during a 6-month postoperative study period, whereas the clinic based schedule specified 24 physical therapy visits during those 6 months. All patients entered in the study met strict selection criteria: age older than 15 years, no previous ligament repair or reconstruction, no complicating medical conditions, no collegiate or professional athletes, reconstruction at least 6 weeks after injury, and informed consent. At the 6-month followup, no significant statistical differences were found between the two groups in range of motion, thigh atrophy, anterior drawer compliance, hopping tests, Lysholm scores, or subjective health status scores. Thus, the authors conclude that in a selected group of patients who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, a home based postoperative rehabilitation program is feasible, safe, and effective.","","adult; aged; allograft; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; autograft; biomechanics; female; health status; human; informed consent; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; outcomes research; patella tendon; priority journal","","","","","","","Bilko, Thomas E., Current trends in repair and rehabilitation of complete (acute) anterior cruciate ligament injuries: Analysis of 1984 questionnaire completed by ACL Study Group, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 2, pp. 143-147, (1986); Holmes Cf Lance ED Turtutto TC Schenck Rc A Prospective Outcome Study of Home Rehabilitation Programs Following Acl Reconstruction J Occup Sports Phys Ther 23 72 1996, (2007); de Carlo, Mark S., Traditional versus accelerated rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction: A one-year follow-up, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 15, 6, pp. 309-316, (1992); Fu, Freddie H., Current concepts for rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy, 15, 6, pp. 270-278, (1992); Glasgow, Steven G., The effect of early versus late return to vigorous activities on the outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 243-248, (1993); Huegel, Marty O., Trends in rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction., Clinics in sports medicine, 7, 4, pp. 801-811, (1988); Irrgang, James J., Modern trends in anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation: Nonoperative and postoperative management, Clinics in Sports Medicine, 12, 4, pp. 797-813, (1993); Jokl, Peter, Independent home versus supervised rehabilitation following arthroscopic knee surgery-A prospective randomized trial, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 5, 4, pp. 298-305, (1989); Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); MacDonald, Peter B., Effects of an Accelerated Rehabilitation Program after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Combined Semitendinosus-Gracilis Autograft and a Ligament Augmentation Device, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 5, pp. 588-592, (1995)","","","Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","","","","","","0009921X","","CORTB","9520889","English","Clin.

One knee of each pair was fixed using Acufex instruments and the two-incision technique; one knee was fixed using Arthrotek instruments and the one- incision technique. We used cannulated 9 x 25 mm Kurosaka screws for femoral and tibial tunnel fixation. All knees were mounted on the Instron Test System and were stressed to failure by recreating a pivot shift maneuver. The one- incision technique graff fixation was significantly stronger (mean failure, 695 N) than that with the two-incision technique (mean failure, 593 N). In all one-incision technique knees, either the patellar tendon graft avulsed off a bone plug or the plug broke. In five of six two-incision technique knees, the tibial bone plug pulled out around the interference screw. Patellar tendon graft length ranges from 90 to 105 mm, and the average two- incision technique tunnel length is 120 mm. The interference screw compressed the femoral bone plug into cortical bone but compressed the tibial bone plug into cancellous bone in the two-incision technique, while in the one-incision technique the bone plug was compressed into cortical bone on both sides.","","adult; allograft; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; bone graft; bone strength; cadaver; clinical article; female; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; male; outcomes research; priority journal; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment failure","","","","","","","Brown, Charles H., The biomechanics of interference screw fixation of patellar tendon anterior cruciate ligament grafts, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 6, pp. 880-886, (1993); Butler, James Clark, Optimal graft fixation—The effect of gap size and screw size on bone plug fixation in ACL reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 10, 5, pp. 524-529, (1994); Jackson, Douglas W., Endoscopic ACL reconstruction, Orthopedics, 16, 9, pp. 951-958, (1993); Kurosaka, Masahiro, A biomechanical comparison of different surgical techniques of graft fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 3, pp. 225-229, (1987); Lemos, Mark J., Assessment of initial fixation of endoscopic interference femoral screws with divergent and parallel placement, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 1, pp. 37-41, (1995); Morgan, Craig D., Isometry testing for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction revisited, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 6, pp. 647-659, (1995); Noyes, Frank R., Biomechanical analysis of human ligament grafts used in knee-ligament repairs and reconstructions, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 66, 3, pp. 344-352, (1984); Shelbourne, K.

In 25 rabbits, the ACL was reconstructed with an autogenous iliotibial band (ITB), and in 31 rabbits an autogenous patellar tendon bone (PTB) graft was used. Reconstructed ACLs failed in 20 of the 25 animals in the ITB group and in 26 of 31 in the PTB group. Gross and histological examinations in the animals with successfully reconstructed ACLs (5 in the ITB group and 5 in the PTB group) showed significant tibial deformity and tibial shortening, with progressive thinning of the epiphyseal plate and disorders of the cartilage column on the medial side of the tibia. These abnormalities were not observed in rabbits whose ACLs were torn. This experiment showed that successful ACL reconstruction in young animals with an open physis may result in deformities and/or shortening of the leg. Accordingly, we believe that special care should be taken when surgically reconstructing an ACL in a young patient whose physes are still open.","ACL reconstruction; Deformity; Epiphyseal plate; Growth disturbance; Tenoepiphysiodesis","animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; chondropathy; controlled study; graft failure; leg malformation; ligament surgery; nonhuman; patella tendon; rabbit","","","","","","Acknowledgments.

We prospectiveiy recorded height, weight, sex, and which patients subsequently tore their contralateral anterior cruciate ligament or the 10-mm autograft. The patients were divided into two groups based on notch width (group 1, ≤15 mm; group 2, ≤16 mm). The mean notch width was 13.9 ± 2.2 mm for women and 15.9 ± 2.5 mm for men. There was no statistically significant difference in notch width between height groups for women or men. Analysis showed that, with height and weight as covariates, women had statistically significantly narrower notches than men. Twenty- three of 388 patients in group 1 and 4 of 326 patients in group 2 tore their contralateral anterior cruciate ligaments. Within groups, no statistically significant differences in contralateral tear rates existed between men and women. Once the men and women had reconstructions with equally sized 10-mm autografts, there was no difference in graft tear rate between groups or between men and women. Our results show that patients with narrower notches have a higher incidence of tearing their contralateral anterior cruciate ligament. After reconstruction with a 10-mm autograft, the incidence of graft rupture is the same for men and women.","","anatomical variation; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; body height; correlation function; female; functional anatomy; human; incidence; knee arthroplasty; major clinical study; male; physical parameters; priority journal; sex difference; tendon graft; treatment failure; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Surgery of the Knee Second Edition, (1993); Anderson, Allen F., Analysis of the intercondylar notch by computed tomography, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 15, 6, pp. 547-552, (1987); Arendt, Elizabeth Anne, Knee Injury Patterns Among Men and Women in Collegiate Basketball and Soccer: NCAA Data and Review of Literature, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 6, pp. 694-701, (1995); Skeletal Attribution of Race, (1990); J Athl Train, (1992); Bergfeld, John A., Injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, Physician and Sportsmedicine, 10, 11, pp. 47-59, (1982); Cahill, Bernard R., Effect of preseason conditioning on the incidence and severity of high school football knee injuries, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 6, 4, pp. 180-184, (1978); Cameron, Bruce M., The swivel football shoe: A controlled study:Fixation of the foot through rigid cleating is a primary factor in the production of football knee and ankle injuries., The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 1, 2, pp. 16-27, (1973); Feagin, John A., Mechanism of injury and pathology of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 16, 1, pp. 41-45, (1985); Ferretti, Andrea, Knee ligament injuries in volleyball players, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 203-207, (1992)","","","SAGE Publications Inc. claims@sagepub.com","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","9617403","English","Am.

Correlation coefficient analyses determined whether the relationship between knee muscle strength recovery and the hop test was invariant across all levels of residual anterior laxity and whether the relationship between residual anterior laxity and the hop test was invariant across levels of quadriceps muscle strength recovery. Furthermore, we examined the effect of graft harvest site on the hop index. Positive correlations were found between the hop index and muscle strength index at all levels of residual anterior laxity (P < 0.05), but these correlation coefficients were relatively low. There were no apparent correlations between the hop index and residual anterior laxity at all levels of quadriceps muscle strength recovery.

Evaluation included Lysholm scores, instrumented Lachman tests, IKDC level, and lateral radiographs to measure the tibia position versus the femur. One year after surgery we did not find any significant difference between the two groups. We conclude that the importance of graft tensioning has yet to be established in the clinical situation.

One-hundred unstable knees with ACL reconstruction by the so-called single-incision technique, using bone- patellar tendon-bone free autograft, undergo postoperative follow-up over 31 months average. A roentgenographic analysis is done on the ground of antero- posterior (AP) and lateral (LL) views, and CT measurements of the intercondylar groove. Good to excellent results on the IKDC-form are recorded in 73 per cent. Postoperatively no evidence of patella infera is found. According to Harner's scheme, on the LL views the tibial tunnel is positioned mainly in the 2nd quadrant (94 %). According to Aglietti, angulation of the femoral tunnel (F<inf>2</inf>) amounts to 140°average, and of the tibial tunnel (T<inf>2</inf>) - 53°. On the AP projection femoral tunnel angulation (F<inf>1</inf>) is 65°average, and tibial tunnel angulation (T<inf>1</inf>) - 53°. In eight knees lateral location of the tibial tunnel (type C according to Muneta) is not clinically manifested with graft impingement to the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle. Intraoperative x-ray monitoring facilitates the surgeon in locating the intraarticular holes of the tunnels, and accordingly allows for exact postoperative interpretation of some of the causes leading to operative failure upon comparison with the clinical results.","Arthroscopy; Knee instability; Ligament reconstruction; X-ray control","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; human; interventional radiology; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; knee radiography; ligament surgery; major clinical study; patella tendon; tendon graft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0486400X","","RENRA","","Bulgarian","Rentgenol.

Patellar tendon is probably the most common graft used, but gracilis and semitendinous tendons present some interesting advantages: small incision, large graft when doubled, characteristics close to ACL, rapid harvest. We describe a combined intra- and extra-articular arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendons which includes some original steps. The tendons are harvested, leaving the distal insertion intact, and sutured together. After drilling of the tibial tunnel, an over-the-top arrangement is formed, creating a groove in the posterolateral aspect of the femur. The tendons are then fixed with double staples in the groove, and their remaining part is fixed distally to Gerdy's tubercle passing under the fascia, but over the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). This technique ensures sufficient strength in the graft and permits correction of any associated instability, because of the presence of the extra-articular portion of the tendons. Furthermore, the over-the-top arrangement reduces trauma and possible pitfalls related to tunnel construction and permits isometry of the extra-articular portion to be established. Forty patients involved in sports activity were prospectively selected and evaluated at a minimum 2 years' follow-up. IKDC score and Lysholm score were used for clinical evaluation, and the KT-2000 was used for instrumental laxity measurements. Resumption of sport and time to that point were recorded as well as Tegner activity score. We had 92.5% normal and fairly normal knees according to IKDC score and only 7.5% abnormal knees. Mean Lysholm score was 95. Mean Tegner score was 7.2. KT-2000 showed a mean injured/uninjured difference of 2.1 mm. In all, 90% of patients resumed sports at the same level, 67.5% in 3-4 months and 27.5% in 4-6 months. The highly satisfactory results of this series with no major complications confirm the reliability of this techinque and the possibility of guaranteeing functional behaviour in the knee.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Arthroscopy; Extra-articular reconstruction; Hamstrings","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; clinical trial; endoscopy; female; graft survival; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; methodology; pathology; pathophysiology; plastic surgery; prognosis; statistical model; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Endoscopy; Female; Graft Survival; Humans; Knee Joint; Linear Models; Male; Prognosis; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons","","","","","","","Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Amiel, David A., The natural history of the anterior cruciate ligament autograft of patellar tendon origin, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 6, pp. 449-462, (1986); Am J Knee Surg, (1991); Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

Knowledge concerning the postoperative disability after harvesting the patellar tendon is, however, limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact patellar tendon suture and bone grafting of the patellar bone defect might have in terms of functional outcome and patellofemoral pain after harvesting the bone-tendon-bone graft, compared with leaving the harvested site non-sutured and non-grafted. Sixty patients, scheduled for arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction, were randomly allocated to two groups. In group I, suture of the patellar tendon and bone grafting of the patellar defect were performed. In group II, the tendon gap and the patellar defect were left open. Preoperatively, there was no significant difference between the groups when comparing objective knee stability, as measured with a KT-1000 laxity meter, Lysholm score, Tegner activity level, IKDC score, or patello-femoral pain score. Both groups had a significantly improved Lysholm score at the 2-year follow-up, without any difference between them. Tegner's activity level was significantly lower at follow-up, compared with the pre-injury level in both groups. The patellofemoral pain score improved significantly after the reconstruction, without any difference between the groups. Ultrasonography did not reveal any difference between the groups in terms of healing of the tendon gap. This study revealed no differences in donor site morbidity, functional outcome, patellofemoral pain score or knee joint stability between the two treatment groups. The conclusion is that suture of the patellar tendon and bone grafting of the patellar defect do not improve the functional results or reduce donor site morbidity after arthroscopically assisted ACL.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Donar site morbidity; Patellar tendon defects","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; clinical trial; echography; female; graft survival; human; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; male; methodology; middle aged; patella; pathology; pathophysiology; plastic surgery; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; reoperation; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Graft Survival; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Prognosis; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Reoperation; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Adriani, Ezio, Healing of the patellar tendon after harvesting of its mid-third for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and evolution of the unclosed donor site defect, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 3, pp. 138-143, (1995); Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 4, pp. 510-516, (1992); Almekinders, Louis C., Post-operative problems following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 2, pp. 78-82, (1995); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Berg, Eugene E., Lateral femoral condyle fracture after endoscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy, 10, 6, pp. 693-695, (1994); Bonatus, Timothy J., Patellar fracture and avulsion of the patellar ligament complicating arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Orthopaedic Review, 20, 9, pp. 770-774, (1991); Bouchard, Claude, Fracture of the patella during rehabilitation of the knee extensor muscles following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A brief report, Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine, 3, 2, pp. 118-122, (1993); Breitfuss, H., The tendon defect after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the midthird patellar tendon-a problem for the patellofemoral joint?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 194-198, (1996); Cerullo, Guglielmo, Anterior cruciate ligament patellar tendon reconstruction: it is probably better to leave the tendon defect open!, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 1, pp. 14-17, (1995); Christen, B., Fractures associated with patellar ligament grafts in cruciate ligament surgery, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series B, 74, 4, pp. 617-619, (1992)","J.

The isokinetic torque for extension and flexion (Cybex) and the range of motion (ROM) were investigated after 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks postoperatively. At 24 weeks and 1 year postoperatively the stability of the knee joint (KT-1000) as well as the clinical outcome ('Orthopädische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Knie') were evaluated. No statistically significant differences between the two groups were found for the extension and flexion strengths. Free ROM was achieved significantly earlier in group A than in group B. No statistically significant differences regarding the stability of the operated knee joint nor the early outcome were found between the two groups. This study demonstrated that the renunciation of using a brace had no adverse effect on the early outcome with respect to stability and function. On the contrary, bracing seems not to be mandatory after ACL reconstruction when the central third of the patellar tendon is used.","Aggressive rehabilitation; Anterior cruciate ligament; Patellar tendon graft","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; bandage; brace; clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; methodology; pathology; pathophysiology; plastic surgery; postoperative care; prognosis; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bandages; Braces; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Postoperative Care; Prognosis; Range of Motion, Articular; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures","","","","","","","Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anterior cruciate ligament replacement using patellar tendon.

Thirty-five patients (17 men, 18 women) undergoing second-look arthroscopy for a reconstructed ACL were selected at random for postoperative participation in the study at 6, 12, and 18 months. Eight patients with an intact ACL had their blood flow measured arthroscopically for a control. Under arthroscopic visualization, a 3 mm probe was placed through a trocar sleeve into the ACL. Functional flow was evaluated using LDF, for which the output signal, the blood cell flux (BCF), is expressed in terms of volts. These patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); MRI, IKDC final evaluation, and second-look arthroscopic findings for each patient were compared with the others. In normal ACL, the BCF value ranged from 120 to 130 mV, and synovial blood flow, 90-132 mV. Significantly high BCF values for the reconstructed ACL were noted at 6 and 12 months, but there was no change in synovial BCF postoperatively. There was a gradual return to near normal BCF values for the reconstructed ACL 18 months after surgery. Significantly abnormal BCF values (580 ± 20 mV) were seen in cases with a severely abnormal IKDC final evaluation; there were few differences in BCF values between normal, nearly normal, and abnormal. LDF is easy to use and appears to be a reproducible technique for evaluating blood flow in the reconstructed ACL, offering distinct advantages for evaluating its maturation. Six months after surgery, there was a decrease in MRI with a high signal intensity, whereas the BCF values in the reconstructed ACL generally needed 18 months to return to near normal; the return was gradual. We believe the blood supply of the reconstructed ACL may originate from the synovium of posterior joint capsule within 6 months after surgery.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Blood cell flux; Laser Doppler flowmetry; Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation; Second-look arthroscopy","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; blood rheology; female; human; laser Doppler flowmetry; male; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; plastic surgery; synovium; time; vascularization; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Hemorheology; Humans; Laser-Doppler Flowmetry; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Synovial Membrane; Time Factors","","","","","","","Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 172, pp. 19-25, (1983); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Blood supply to the anterior cruciate ligament and supporting structures, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 16, 1, pp. 15-28, (1985); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Microvasculature of the cruciate ligaments and its response to injury.

Material and methods: The authors analized two consecutive series of 60 and 50 patients operated by the same surgeon for a chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, one by reconstruction of the cruciate ligament with a free graft of the patellar tendon supplemented by an external extra-articular plasty made with a quadriceps tendon graft and the second with an isolated free patellar tendon graft. Anterior laxity was measured before and after surgery, by dynamic X- rays and by the Medmetric KT-1000 arthrometer. Functional results were evaluated four years after operation, with the French A.R.P.E.GE score based on sport activity level and intensity. Results: Anterior laxity was not different before operation in both groups and there was no difference between males and females. Medmetric KT-1000 arthrometer showed the same negative differential laxity immediately after surgery in both groups and the same evolution during the first 4 years, without any significant difference on laxity on the middle aspect of the knee. Radiological results were different. After a 4 years follow-up, anterior laxity did not show significant difference on the medial compartment of the knee (5.3 ± 2.3 mm and 5.5 ± 1.7 mm), but there was a significant minor laxity in the lateral compartment for the lateral extra-articular plasty group (11.0 ± 2.3 mm against 14.8 ± 3.8 mm) (p = 0.002). Functional results and sport activity were similar in both groups. Examination showed 4 positive pivot shift tests (2' sliding' and 2 positive) in the group with extra-articular plasty, even though 8 positive pivot shift tests in the isolated ACL group (5 'sliding' and 3 positive) were found. Discussion: This study as well as five others studies found in literature, was not randomized. In all these series, the surgical techniques, the rehabilitation programs and the functional score evaluation were too different to allow any pertinent comparison. Extra-articular plasty helps to control the laxity of the lateral compartment of the knee which is incompletely controlled by ACL reconstruction, particularly in chronic cases. This is proved by radiological measurements and pivot shift tests. Jensen in 1983, about 205 patients with a 4 year follow-up and Noyes, which used an allograft patellar tendon, found an advantage to do extra-articular plasty. But Strum (in 1989), as O'Brien (in 1991) and Roth (in 1987), did not found any advantage with extra-articular plasty. Conclusion: It is therefore obvious after a four-year follow-up, that extra-articular supplementation presents an advantage for reconstruction of the ACL, by a free graft of the patellar tendon in chronic cases. Further randomized study w confirm that isolated ACL reconstruction is possible in some well definited categories of anterior laxity.","","adult; aged; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; follow up; human; joint laxity; ligament surgery; major clinical study; patella tendon; quadriceps femoris muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Child; Female; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Butler, David L., Mechanical properties of primate vascularized vs. nonvascularized patellar tendon grafts; changes over time, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 7, 1, pp. 68-79, (1989); Carson, William G., The role of lateral extra-articular procedures for anterolateral rotatory instability., Clinics in sports medicine, 7, 4, pp. 751-772, (1988); Clancy, William G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using one-third of the patellar ligament, augmented by extra-articular tendon transfers, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 64, 3, pp. 352-359, (1982); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985); Engebretsen, Lars, The effect of an iliotibial tenodesis on intraarticular graft forces and knee joint motion, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 2, pp. 169-176, (1990); Hoogland, T., Intra-articular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

The aim of the present study was to propose and validate an intensive method of re-education in subjects operated by arthroscopy for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) with transplant of the patellar tendon (Kenneth-Jones technique). Methods. In line with this aim, all patients underwent COTUR assessment to analyze pain, range of motion attained, possibility of Joint giving way and/or hydrarthrosis, pivot-shift. In addition, the following tests were applied: electromyographic surface examination to monitor the recovery of muscle fibre contractility of the rectus femoris and vastus medialis; the Lachman-Trillat radiographic test 20 days after the operation to verify whether mobilization and early load concession were responsible for traction stress on the neo-ligament; and the isokinetics test carried out before and at different intervals after the operation. Results. On the COTUR assessment, patients obtained a mean final score of 93.48 out of a possible total of 100 (range 75-100). The isokinetic tests showed a progressive reduction of the strength deficit of both flexors and extensors. Values of initial median frequency (IMF) and median frequency (MF) showed more modest differences between healthy and operated sides at 3 months after the operation, than at the examination carried out prior to the operation. Conclusions. The study shows that intensive rehabilitation can be commenced in this pathology in the days immediately following the operation, but should be supported by a through, scrupulous clinical and instrumental monitoring (measure of laxity, functional assessment and strength measurements). The function of the clinical-instrumental monitoring is to guide the rehabilitative programme, its object being to prevent possible femoro-patellar complications, reduce articularity deficits, ensure a greater hold of the ligament at the tibial translation, and permit the resumption of work and/or sporting activity under the most correct physiological conditions of physical performance.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Rehabilitation","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; electromyography; female; human; joint mobility; knee arthroscopy; knee injury; knee ligament injury; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; pain assessment; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00142573","","EUMPA","","English","Eur.

A total of 38 patients operated using the patellar tendon (PT group: 17 cases) and the doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (DSTG group: 21 cases) groft alternately, followed by the same rehabilitation program, were selected according to the following criteria: 1) not more than 5 mm anterior tibial translation of the operated versus the contralateral knee in the KT-1000 test at 30 Ibs 2) freedom from symptoms and resumption of sport at a high level; 3) unimpaired contralateral limb and intact ACL. The controls were 40 subjects matched with the patients for age, sex, height, weight, dominant limb and level of sports activity. Isokinetic evaluation of all subjects was performed with a Cybex II at 60°, 120° and 180°/sec. In the PT group, the mean quadriceps deficiency versus the contralateral limb was 3% and 5% versus the controls. In the DSTG group, the mean hamstring deficiency was 6% versus the contralateral limb and 9% versus the controls. The quadriceps also displayed a deficiency versus the contralateral in both groups. The hamstrings in the PT group were equal to the contralateral, whereas in the DSTG group there was a slight negative difference. The flexor/extensor ratio, too, was more markedly different vis-à-vis the controls in the PT group. Lastly, the peak torque angle was significantly greater for the quadriceps and the hamstrings in both patient groups compared with the controls.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Isokinetic evaluation; Muscle strength","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; female; functional assessment; hamstring; human; ligament surgery; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Alm, Anders, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by using the medial third of the patellar ligament.

A minimum five-year follow-up. J. Sports Traumatol. rel. res. 19: 57-68, 1997. The results of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed by the same surgeon alternately with patellar tendon (PT) and doubled semitendinosus/gracilis tendon (DSTG)grafts in two groups of 30 patients with chronic, isolated unilateral tears have been prospectively compared. There were not significant differences in terms of age, sex, injury-surgery interval and level of sport. At an average follow-up of 5.7 yrs (range 5.2-6.2) the patients were evaluated by clinical (IKDC form), arthrometric (KT-2000) and isokinetic (Cybex II) testing. Two significant differences were noted: giving way, absent in the PT group, was 13% in the DSTG group (p=.03); recovery of hamstrings strength was lower in the DSTG group at both 60° and 180°/sec (p=.03 and p=.007 respectively). Return to sport, objective stability, ROM and patellofemoral symptoms were not significantly different. Anterior tibial translation compared with the contralateral knee (30 lbs) was more than 5 mm in 17% of the PT group versus 30% of the DSTG group (n.s.). We feel that the PT is the graft of choice for athletes with more serious joint laxity, since it gives better results in terms of stability and has less influence on the recovery of muscle strength. The semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, however, provide a sound alternative for patients with a lower functional demand, prior patellofemoral problems, and without associated ligament lesions and in revision surgery after employment of the PT.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Patellar tendon; Semitendinosus and gracilis","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopic surgery; article; clinical article; female; gracilis muscle; human; intermethod comparison; joint stability; knee arthroscopy; knee injury; knee surgery; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; sport injury; surgical technique; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Jones, K.

The ACL was reconstructed with a bone-tendon-bone graft from the medial third of the patellar tendon. The graft was stabilized without screws in the femur and tibia by press-fit. To imitate the anatomical functioning of the ACL, the femoral bone block was placed with the tendon close to the over-the-top position. The tibial block was then placed in a trough on the tibia, so that the ligament fibres were parallel and tight during extension and slightly inverted during flexion. At evaluation mean 41 (25-61) months postoperatively, the mean Lysholm score was 93 (80-100) points, the mean activity level was 6 (3-10) points, and the mean translation of the tibia head, measured by the KT-1000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference), was 2 (0-7) mm. Only 3 of the patients suffered loss of extension (5°). Patients who underwent reconstruction at least 4 months after the injury had better results than those who were operated earlier. The press-fit method allowed for anatomic substitution of the ACL with a stable graft without the disadvantages associated with screws. This method gave early postoperative functioning of the knee and good mid-term results.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical article; female; femur; follow up; human; knee function; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; scoring system; surgical technique; tendon graft; tibia; treatment outcome; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; bone transplantation; endoscopy; injury; knee injury; methodology; rupture; tendon; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Transplantation; Endoscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Rupture; Tendons","","","","","","","Bernard, Manfred, Intraoperative and postoperative insertion control of ACL grafts.

We wanted to know if the complications were dependent upon timing and technique of surgery. Method: We reviewed 283 patients after ACL-reconstruction, who underwent an operation with bone patellar tendon graft between 1984-1993. In our study we particularly looked for complications. The overall rate of complications was 21.6% dependent on the applied technique. Infections, DVTs, limitations of movement and graft failures were the most common complications. Furthermore we analyzed the timing of operation. Arthrofribrosis was less common in the group with delayed reconstruction (6.1%) whereas in the primary reconstruction group the rate was 17.6%. For this reason we changed our management with regard to the timing of operation. Meniscal injuries were the most common additional injuries in both groups. Conservatively treated ACL-ruptures showed a high rate of meniscal ruptures in combination with cartilage injuries. Conclusion: Because of these results we put more emphasis on patient information to achieve the optimal result and to meet the individual needs for every patient.","ACL reconstruction; complications; patellar tendon graft; technique; timing of surgery","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; controlled study; human; major clinical study; patella tendon; patient information; postoperative complication; surgical technique; tendon graft; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; comparative study; endoscopy; female; injury; knee injury; knee meniscus; male; postoperative care; retrospective study; tendon transfer; time; treatment outcome; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Endoscopy; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Menisci, Tibial; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Tendon Transfer; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Holmes, P.

The aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative evolution of anterior laxity, in order to know at what time the elongation of the reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) begins to develop after surgery, and if there were any correlations with recuporation of knee flexion or extension. The second purpose of this study was to compare two series of patients operated on by two different procedures for a long standing ACL rupture. Material and methods. Two series of patients were compared: group I (60 cases), had an ACL reconstruction using a free autologous patellar tendon graft with a bone-to-bone fixation, supplemented by an external extra-articular plasty with a strip of quadricipital tendon as a direct prolongation of the graft of the patellar tendon and patella itself. 'Mac InJones', and group II (50 cases), had a reconstruction with a similar transplant, but still attached on the tibia and with a fibrous fixation through the femoral condyle and the Gerdy's tubercule (modified 'Marshall-Mac Intosh'). Anterior laxity was measured using two instrumented methods; first, Medmetric knee arthrometer (KT-1000)(TM), before and after operation, then each month later during the first 6 months and yearly. On the other hand, a personnal stress X-ray protocol (at 20°of flexion and with application of a 9 kg lead at the distal part of the thigh), was made before operation, 6 months later, and yearly during 8 years. The laxity of both medial and lateral compartments of the knee were separatively measured. Laxity was studied in parallel with the recuporation of knee flexion and extension during a rehabilitation program without any limitation in both directions. Results. During a period of 3 months, the laxity was arthrometrically inferior to the normal knee in the two groups, and appeared progressively. Laxity was independant from early recuperation of full range of flexion and extension. The elongation of the reconstructed ligament was showed to develop during the first 6 months and less during the following 6 months. Better results were found for group I during the earliest period with the Medmetric arthrometer, but there was no difference between both groups after 1 year and 2 years. With dynamic radiography, laxity was higher than indicated by KT-1000, and results were better for group I. Laxity was stabilized after one year and the results were still good after 8 years. Discussion. KT-1000 showed a great interest for measurement of the compliance index (difference between laxity at 89 newtons and 69 newtons of traction), and can be used without any inconvenient for patients. Stress radiographs may be used for yearly controls. The radiographic method had better accuracy than KT-1000 and gave precise laxity measurements of the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The laxity of the medial compartment showed to have a good pronostic value. Conclusion. Evolution of laxity is more favourable in group I with bone-to-bone ligament fixation. Recovering early and complete flexion and extension is not projudicial for the ligament. Laxity, developed between 3 and 6 months and loss between 6 and 12 months. KT-1000 is able to detect laxity during early postoperative period. Dynamic radiographs are more precise to control laxity year after year. Informations concerning the two compartments of the knee are of great interest to compare different procedures and to improve new surgical techniques.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; comparative study; human; knee instability; major clinical study; patella tendon; postoperative complication; surgical technique; anterior cruciate ligament; female; follow up; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; male; methodology; prospective study; tendon; tendon transfer; transplantation; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendon Transfer; Tendons","","","","","","","Anderson, Allen F., Instrumented evaluation of knee laxity: A comparison of five arthrometers, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 2, pp. 135-140, (1992); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anterior cruciate ligament replacement using patellar tendon.

The patients were followed prospectively and objective physical examination data were obtained on 806 patients at a mean of 4.0 years postoperatively. Subjective follow-up data were obtained on 948 patients at a mean of 4.4 years postoperatively. The mean final range of motion was 5°/0°/140°. The mean manual maximum KT-1000 arthrometer score was 2.0 ± 1.5 mm. Isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength testing revealed a mean of 94% strength after acute reconstructions and 91% strength after chronic reconstructions. International Knee Documentation Committee evaluation after acute reconstruction rated 42% of knees as normal, 47% as near normal, 10% as abnormal, and 1% as severely abnormal. The same evaluation after chronic reconstruction rated 41% of knees as normal, 44% as near normal, 14% as abnormal, and 1% as severely abnormal. Radiographically, 94% of acute knees and 89% of chronic knees had no joint space narrowing. Subjective modified Noyes questionnaire results showed a mean score of 93.2 ± 7.9 points. The mean time for patients to return to sport-specific activities was 6.2 weeks and to athletic competition at full capacity was 6.2 months postoperatively. In the long term, patients exhibited full range of motion, excellent stability, good strength, and a return of full function in most cases.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; autograft; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; knee arthroplasty; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; muscle strength; patella tendon; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Knee Ligaments Structure Function Injury and Repair, (1990); Amiel, David A., The natural history of the anterior cruciate ligament autograft of patellar tendon origin, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 14, 6, pp. 449-462, (1986); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anterior cruciate ligament replacement using patellar tendon.

Material: Seventy nine patients, 17 to 39 years old (average 27 years), underwent an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability, using a free bone- patellar tendon-bone graft. In 43 cases, a lateral extra-articular plasty was added (Lemaire's procedure). The reconstruction was arthroscopically assisted in 17 cases. Interval between initial injury and surgery was 24 months (2 months to 9 years and 7 months). The average follow-up was 2.5 years (range 1 to 18). Method: All patients were reviewed for evaluation with two scoring systems (Arpege and IKDC). Roentgenograms of both knees, including antero- posterior weight-bearing and lateral view, patellar view, dynamic radiographs, allowed evaluation of post-operative arthrosis and residual anterior laxity in extension. Fischer's test and chi square test were used for statistical evaluation. Results: Using the Arpege CLAS system, functional results were excellent or good in 75.9 per cent of cases (excellent in 44.3 per cent, good in 31.5 per cent), fair in 15.2 per cent, poor in 8.9 per cent; according to the IKDC system, 65.8 per cent were excellent or good. 84.8 per cent of the patients were satisfied in Arpege system and 91.2 per cent in IKDC system. The pivot-shift test was negative in 86 per cent, equivocal in 7.6 per cent and positive in 6.4 per cent. The radiological Lachman's test (difference between control and affected knee) was 0-2 mm in 53.2 per cent, 3-5 mm in 39.2 per cent, 6-10 mm in 7.6 per cent, never greater than 10 mm. Antero-posterior weight-bearing radiographs were normal in 83.5 per cent, showed joint remodeling in 10.1 per cent pre-arthrosis in 6.3 per cent but no arthrosis. Functional results were not correlated with age at time of surgery, interval between initial injury and surgery, nor clinical Lachman s test. Competitive sportsman had a better result (p = 0.001). Residual laxity in extension was correlated with lesions of medial meniscus (p = 0.035). Degenerative changes in femoro-tibial joint were correlated with residual laxity in extension (p = 0.019). There was no significative difference between A.C.L. reconstruction isolated or associated with lateral extra-articular tenodesis. Time to return to work was shorter for patients with arthroscopically assisted procedure (p = 0.067). Discussion and conclusion: Functional results after A.C.L. reconstruction using a free bone-patellar tendon-bone graft are satisfactory and confirm the reliability of this procedure. Arpege CLAS and IKDC systems give comparable functional results, but IKDC evaluate anatomical results, residual laxity and degenerative changes of the joint, that constitute essential long-term pronostic factors. Morbidity of patellar tendon harvesting appears to be of short duration and largely reversible. Added lateral extra-articular tenodesis doesn't improve the results.

The interval between surgery and arthroscopy ranged from 6 to 26 months, with a mean of 13.1 months. The patients were classified into 4 grades according to the arthroscopical findings as follows: grade 1, ligamentous tissue ruptured or not observed; grade II, loose and thin ligamentous tissue observed; grade III, thick and taut ligamentous tissue observed, but some ligamentous strands exposed from the synovial tissue: grade IV, thick and taut ligamentous tissue with a synovial tissue observed, as in normal ACL. Based on the arthroscopical findings, 4 of the 92 patients were rated as grade I, 11 as grade II, 24 as grade III, and 53 as grade IV. Correlation between the arthroscopical and functional test results indicated that the mean injured-to-uninjured differences of KT-1000 measurements were significantly smaller in the grade IV group than in the grade I and grade II groups (p < 0.05). These results suggest that postoperative anterior knee laxity correlate significantly with arthroscopical results, and is a useful parameter for evaluating ACL reconstruction.","","biomaterial; polyester; adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; female; follow up; human; injury; male; methodology; middle aged; patella; pathology; plastic surgery; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Biocompatible Materials; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patella; Polyesters; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tendons","","Biocompatible Materials; Polyesters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00480444","","","9436371","English","Nippon Ika Daigaku Zasshi","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031305096"

Philipp, Trauma Department, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Niedersachsen, Germany","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with patellar tendon graft has become a standard procedure. The graft can be inserted either using two tunnels and a lateral femoral incision or with a femoral half-tunnel drilled from the joint, thus avoiding the lateral incision. Advantages have been claimed for the single-incision technique in the early rehabilitation period. Forty patients with ACL deficiency were included in a prospective randomized trial comparing the single- and two-incision technique with a follow-up period of 12 months. Preoperative data did not show any significant difference between the two groups. At early follow-up no differences were observed with respect to complications or the progress of rehabilitation. Evaluation at 12 months post-operatively using the IKDC form revealed good to excellent results in 70% of patients. ACL reconstruction reduced anterior translation of the knee significantly at the 6-month and 12-month follow-up with a slight increase of MMD values at 12 months in both groups. The arthroscopic single-incision technique did not differ from the mini-open technique in terms of postoperative pain medication, incidence of effusion, postoperative range-of-motion or any rehabilitation parameters. Stability was comparable in both groups at all time periods. We conclude that an arthroscopic single-incision technique has no advantage over a mini-open two-incision technique for ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft in terms of subjective or objective parameters.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Patellar tendon graft; Single-incision arthroscopy; Two-incision arthroscopy","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; clinical trial; comparative study; female; human; injury; knee injury; male; patella; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rupture; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Patella; Prospective Studies; Rupture; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Bosch, Ulrich, Healing of the patellar tendon autograft after posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction - A process of ligamentization?

Ninety consecutive patients with chronic unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture were operated on by the same surgeon using patellar tendon autografts, the all-inside arthroscopic technique, and interference screw fixation. At the follow-up examination 24 (range 22-32) months after the index operation, the median total anterior-posterior KT-1000 side-to-side difference was 2.5 (-7 to 11) mm. The median Lysholm score was 86 (range 37-100) points and the median Tegner activity level was 6 (range 1-9). Using the IKDC evaluation system, 62 of 90 (69%) were classified as normal or nearly normal. The median one-leg-hop quotient was 93 (range 0-167)% of the uninjured leg. Of 90 patients, 44 (49%) had minor or no discomfort when asked to walk on their knees (kneewalkers) and 46 of 90 (51%) patients had severe problems or found it impossible to perform the test (non-kneewalkers). The 'kneewalkers' had a median loss of anterior knee sensitivity of 10 (range 0-120) cm2. The corresponding value for the 'non-kneewalkers' was 25 (range 0-200) cm2 (P = 0.0001). Palpatory donor-site tenderness was registered in 19 of 44 (43%) of the 'kneewalkers' and 37 of 46 (80%) of the 'non-kneewalkers' (P < 0.001). Full hyperextension was not regained by 9 of 44 (20%) of the 'kneewalkers' and 19 of 46 (41%) of the 'non-kneewalkers' (P < 0.05). Additional surgery during the follow-up period was required by 6 of 44 (14%) of the 'kneewalkers' and 19 of 46 (41%) of the 'non-kneewalkers' (P < 0.01). Magnetic resonance imaging focusing on the donor site was performed on 31 randomly selected patients and revealed no difference between the 'kneewalkers' and the 'non-kneewalkers' in terms of patellar tendon width, thickness, length, and residual donor-site gap size. The kneewalking test was found to be a functional and reliable test for detecting donor-site morbidity. It appears that donor-site morbidity was related to problems requiring additional surgery during the follow-up period, such as extension deficit and pain near the metal implant on the tibial side, as well as the loss of anterior knee sensitivity. It appears to be important to attempt to preserve the sensitivity in the operated area during surgery and to regain full hyperextension in the postoperative period to minimize donor-site morbidity.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts; Donor-site morbidity","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autotransplantation; chronic disease; human; injury; knee injury; middle aged; morbidity; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella; rupture; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Chronic Disease; Humans; Knee Injuries; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Patella; Rupture; Tendons; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","Arthornthurasook, Art, Study of the infrapatellar nerve, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 16, 1, pp. 57-59, (1988); Breitfuss, H., The tendon defect after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the midthird patellar tendon-a problem for the patellofemoral joint?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 4, pp. 194-198, (1996); Buss, Daniel D., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with use of autogenous patellar-ligament grafts.

Twelve patients underwent reconstruction with patellar tendon autografts, and 14 had reconstructions with semitendinosus and gracilis tendon autografts. Synovial samples were obtained at the time of reconstruction from 10 patients and at second-look arthroscopy from all 26 patients. Sections from quick-frozen samples were stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or Fast green and Sirius red. We used sodium hydroxide in absolute methanol to elute the Fast green and Sirius red stains, and the total collagen content of each section was estimated by measuring the optical density of the eluted solution. The volume of each section was determined on a computer using an imaging program, and collagen content per unit of tissue was calculated.

The effect of quadriceps muscle force on a knee specimen loaded to anterior cruciate ligament failure during anterior tibial translation was studied in a human cadaveric model. In both knees from six donors, average age 41 years (range, 31 to 65), the joint capsule and ligaments, except the anterior cruciate ligament, were cut. The quadriceps tendon, patella, patellar tendon, and menisci were left intact. One knee from each pair was randomly selected to undergo destructive testing of the anterior cruciate ligament by anterior tibial translation at a displacement rate of 30 mm/sec with a simultaneously applied 889 N quadriceps muscle force. The knee flexion during testing was 30°. As a control, the contralateral knee was loaded correspondingly, but only 5 N of quadriceps muscle force was applied. The ultimate load for the knee to anterior cruciate ligament failure when tested with 889 N quadriceps muscle force was 22% ± 18% higher than that of knees tested with 5 N of force. The linear stiffness increased by 43% ± 30%. These results did not support the speculation that a quadriceps muscle contraction contributes to anterior cruciate ligament failure. In this model, the quadriceps muscle force protected the anterior cruciate ligament from injury during anterior tibial translation.","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; human; human tissue; joint function; knee injury; muscle contraction; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; skiing; sport injury; stress strain relationship","","","","","","","Aune, Arne Kristian, Effect of quadriceps or hamstring contraction on the anterior shear force to anterior cruciate ligament failure:an in vivo study in the rat, Acta Orthopaedica, 66, 3, pp. 261-265, (1995); Aune, Arne Kristian, Contraction of knee flexors and extensors in skiing related to the backward fall mechanism of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, 5, 3, pp. 165-169, (1995); Beynnon, Bruce D., The measurement of anterior cruciate ligament strain in vivo, International Orthopaedics, 16, 1, pp. 1-12, (1992); Butler, David L., Ligamentous restraints to anterior-posterior drawer in the human knee.

A consecutive series of 90 athletically-active patients (67 males, 23 females) who underwent reconstruction for ACL deficiency using a patellar tendon autograft was retrospectively reviewed. The study group consisted of two treatment subgroups: Group 1-EA (Endoscopic-Assisted technique using no lateral femoral condylar incision) consisted of 45 patients with a mean age of 25 years (range 15 to 43) and Group 2-AA (Arthroscopic-Assisted technique using both anterior and lateral femoral condylar incisions) consisted of 45 patients with a mean age of 25 years (range 16 to 37). The study groups were evaluated at specific postoperative intervals with a mean follow-up in Group 1-EA of 30 months (range 24-37) and in Group 2-AA, 41 months (range 24 to 77). Serial KT-1000 results averaged 2 mm in both groups with 75% of Group 1-EA and 78% in Group 2-AA patients noted to have ≤3 mm side-to-side differences. No statistically significant differences were noted for complications including patellofemoral pain, arthrofibrosis, harvest site pathology, or painful hardware. At ultimate follow-up however, this study suggests that both methods may result in similar and reproducible satisfactory outcome.","ACL Reconstruction; Arthroscopic; Divergence; Endoscopic","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopic surgery; article; autograft; controlled study; female; fibrosis; human; knee radiography; major clinical study; male; morbidity; pain; patella tendon; plastic surgery; postoperative complication; surgical technique","","","","","","","Am J Knee Surg, (1989); Baker, Champ L., Intraarticular ACL reconstruction using the patellar tendon: Arthroscopic technique, Orthopedics, 16, 4, pp. 437-441, (1993); Buss, Daniel D., Arthroscopically assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with use of autogenous patellar-ligament grafts.

A special technique using an oscillating hollow saw allows for the rapid and standardized harvest of cylindrical bone plugs, ensuring safe and adequate femoral press-fit fixation. The complications encountered included one fracture of a bone block on plugging in as well as two cases with revision procedures for interference screw fixation due to insufficient femoral anchorage. Within the framework of a prospective study, all 120 patients underwent a control arthroscopy after the first postoperative year showing viable and mechanically stable grafts in 64 (53.3%) of the patients. In 44 patients (36.7%), viable though somewhat lax grafts were found, whereas the remaining 12 patients (10%) only showed insufficient tissue residues. All of these cases were the result of a ventral misplacement of the femoral insertion site representing the primary complication of transtibial technique. The results of the control arthroscopies showed a highly significant correlation with the clinical results for the IKDC score obtained in a follow up after an average 29 (18 to 36) months. The results for stability according to the IKDC rating scale showed a normal or near-normal knee function in 76.7%. With regard to the subjective results in the IKDC rating scale, 83.3% of the patients (n = 100) assessed their knee function as normal or almost normal. The location and positioning of the femoral and tibial tunnel were evaluated in an exact radiographic evaluation showing an ideal position of the graft in only 94 cases (78.3%). Statistically, a significant correlation of stability with the femoral fixation site could be shown.","ACL reconstruction; Arthroscopic controls; IKDC score; New technique for graft harvest; Press-fit technique","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; controlled study; endoscopic surgery; female; human; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; tendon graft","","","","","","","Carson, William G., A new technique of harvesting patellar tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 7, 4, pp. 368-374, (1991); Jackson, Douglas W., A new technique for harvesting the patella tendon in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Orthopedics, 13, 2, pp. 165-167, (1990); Wang, Jon B., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the lateral one third of the patellar tendon, Techniques in Orthopaedics, 2, 4, pp. 23-27, (1988); McCarroll, John R., Fracture of the patella during a golf swing following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament: A case report, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 11, 1, pp. 26-27, (1983); Ouweleen, Kevin M., A unique complication following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 11, 2, pp. 225-228, (1995); Am J Knee Surg, (1989); Franco, Mark G., Intraarticular placement of Kurosaka interference screws, Arthroscopy, 10, 4, pp. 412-417, (1994); Contemp Orthop, (1994); Jomha, Nadr M., Effect of varying angles on the pullout strength of interference screw fixation, Arthroscopy, 9, 5, pp. 580-583, (1993); Graf, Ben K., Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Patellar Tendon: An Ex Vivo Study of Wear-related Damage and Failure at the Femoral Tunnel, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 1, pp. 131-135, (1994)","","","W.B.

Ninety-four patients (47 of each sex) were matched for chronicity of injury, age, preoperative sports activity levels, articular cartilage condition, and months of followup. All had patellar tendon autogenous reconstruction and a similar program of immediate knee motion and early return to function. The results were rated with the Cincinnati Knee Rating System. At a mean of 26 months postoperatively, there were no significant differences for complications or outcome between men and women. Women required an average of six more rehabilitation visits than men; however, none required additional surgery for knee motion complications and the rate of patellofemoral crepitus conversion was only 7%, lower than that found for men (15%). The overall failure rate was low, only 6% for women and 4% for men.

Five consecutive patients (mean age, 12.9 years; range, 8 to 14 years) with radiographically documented 'wide' open growth plates and a minimum of 5 cm of expected remaining growth, underwent intraarticular reconstruction of the ACL. Operative treatment included three ACL reconstructions using hamstring tendons and two with quadriceps patellar tendon. All involved a centrally placed 6-mm or smaller tibial drill hole through an open physis and graft placement in an over-the- top position on the femur. At an average follow-up of 7.4 years (range, 4.5 to 9.9 years), no patient had a positive anterior drawer, Lachman, or pivot shift test. On KT-10013 arthrometer testing, all patients had 3 mm or less of increased anterior-posterior displacement (mean ± SD = 1.0 ± 1.6 mm). Magnetic resonance imaging showed that four tibial physes had fused in a symmetric fashion and one was still open. Orthoroentgenograms showed that no patient had a significant leg length discrepancy (-0.8 mm ± 3.4 mm). The mean increase in height postoperatively was 17.7 cm (range, 7.6 to 31.0 cm). Overall, using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form, there were four patients with grade A and one with grade C. The one patient with a poor IKDC grade had sustained a subsequent patellar dislocation with osteochondral fracture. In conclusion, ACL reconstruction using small drill holes placed through open tibial physes does not seem to adversely affect outcome or future growth.","ACL reconstruction; Operative treatment; Skeletally immature","adolescent; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone maturation; bone radiography; clinical article; follow up; growth plate; hamstring; high risk patient; human; leg length inequality; ligament surgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; school child; sport injury; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Noyes, Frank R., The strength of the anterior cruciate ligament in humans and rhesus monkeys: Age related and species related changes, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 58, 8, pp. 1074-1082, (1976); J Bone Joint Surg Am, (1963); Kellenberger, R., Nonosseous lesions of the anterior cruciate ligaments in childhood and adolescence., Progress in pediatric surgery, 25, pp. 123-131, (1990); Andrews, Michelle, Anterior Cruciate Ligament Allograft Reconstruction in the Skeletally Immature Athlete, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 1, pp. 48-54, (1994); Angel, Kevin R., Anterior cruciate ligament injury in children and adolescents, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 5, 3, pp. 197-200, (1989); Paul Brief, L., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction without drill holes, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 7, 4, pp. 350-357, (1991); DeLee, Jesse C., Anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency in children, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 172, pp. 112-118, (1983); Engebretsen, Lars, Poor results of anterior cruciate ligament repair in adolescence, Acta Orthopaedica, 59, 6, pp. 684-686, (1988); Graf, Ben K., Anterior cruciate ligament tears in skeletally immature patients: Meniscal pathology at presentation and after attempted conservative treatment, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 2, pp. 229-233, (1992); Kannus, Pekka A., Knee ligament injuries in adolescents.

There were no significant differences between the subgroups for age, sex, articular cartilage lesions, or months of followup. Forty-six meniscal tears were repaired; 27 of these extended into the central avascular region. Rehabilitation emphasized immediate knee motion, but strenuous activity was delayed for at least 4 months. Only one patient had a knee motion complication, and stability (<3 mm, KT-2000 arthrometer, 134 N) was restored in 85% of knees with chronic ruptures and 92% of knees with acute ruptures. Earlier reconstruction should be considered in active persons as symptoms and limitations continued postoperatively in knees with chronic ruptures, leading to overall less satisfactory results. In patient rating of the overall knee condition, 69% of knees with chronic ruptures and 100% of knees with acute ruptures scored in the normal or very good range.

Thirty-eight patients (19 WC benefits, 19 NoWC) were matched for age, injury chronicity, number of prior operations, and months of follow-up. All had the same operation and rehabilitation. A significant difference was found between the groups in the mean number of days of lost employment preoperatively (WC, 122 days; NoWC, 3 days) and postoperatively (WC, 222 days; NoWC, 37 days). At follow-up (mean, 27 months), 17 patients in group WC had returned to work (6 with symptoms) and 2 were disabled. All patients in group NoWC had returned to work, 2 with symptoms. There was no significant difference between the groups for anterior-posterior displacements, functional limitations with daily or sports activities, patient perception of the knee condition, the overall rating score, or complications. The number of mean days of lost employment in group WC could not be accounted for from factors that normally effect anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction results. We hypothesize that other factors such as wage systems that support WC injuries long-term, inability of employers to modify job requirements, inability of employees to receive job retraining, or lack of proper immediate diagnosis and treatment of the injury, may have lead to the large number of lost working days in group WC.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Workers' Compensation","absenteeism; adult; article; clinical article; female; follow up; human; human tissue; job analysis; knee arthroplasty; knee arthroscopy; male; rating scale; treatment outcome; workman compensation","","","","","","From the Cincinnati Sportsmedicine and Orthopaedic Center and the Deaconess Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A.

The results were evaluated with physical examinations, KT-1000 arthrometer and Lysholm scores. The mean follow-up period was 26.8±6.7 months (20-33 months). Objective physical examinations done at the latest follow-up showed 1 patient had a 1-A Lachmann test, 3 patients had 1-A anterior drawer tests and 1 patient had a grade 1 pivot- shift test. Subjectively all patients rated the results as satisfactory, except the 1 patient with the grade 1 pivot-shift test, the result considered merely acceptable. Pre-operative KT-1000 maximum manual difference was 5.60±1.47 mm., which reduced to 1.60±0.65 mm at the latest follow-up. The pre-operative Lysholm score was 30.82±19.28 which improved to 87.19±9.38 at the latest follow-up. There was 1 patient who had an extension lag of 5 degrees and another had a flexion deficit (0-110 degrees). Ten patients still had quadriceps atrophy, 2.0±0.94 cm, at the latest follow-up.

This study group was subdivided into a noncompliant group averaging 1.7 visits over 6 months (range, 0 to 5), (subgroup I), and a minimally compliant group averaging 12 visits over 6 months (range, 5 to 24), (subgroup II). Thirty patients who underwent similar surgeries and postoperative protocols, but participated in an extensive supervised outpatient therapy program, served as controls. The control group was fully compliant and averaged 60 visits over 6 months. After 6 months, the minimally compliant study subgroup was equivalent to the fully compliant control group in Lysholm score, patient satisfaction, and return to preoperative activity level. Both of these groups fared better in all of these indices than did the noncompliant subgroup. These results suggest that extensive supervised rehabilitation does not afford a measurable advantage over a minimally supervised program of two visits monthly. Complete noncompliance, however, was associated with suboptimal outcome.","","adolescent; adult; aftercare; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; comparative study; endoscopy; female; human; kinesiotherapy; knee injury; male; middle aged; patient compliance; retrospective study; sport injury; treatment refusal; Adolescent; Adult; Aftercare; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Athletic Injuries; Endoscopy; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Refusal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10784519","","","9021031","English","Am J.

Pain was present in 7 knees (8%). Giving-way symptoms were reported by 7 patients (8%). A KT-2000 side-to-side difference over 5 mm at 30 lbs was recorded in 12 cases (16%). The pivot shift was glide in 17 cases (19%) and clunk in 10 (11%). A 3°-5° extension loss compared with the normal side was present in 20 knees (22%) and 6°-10° in 4 knees (4%). The intra-articular exit of the femoral tunnel was misplaced in the anterior 50% of the condyles along the roof of the notch in 10% of the knees. This positioning significantly (P = 0.003) increased the frequency of graft failure (62.5%) compared with the cases with a more posterior placement (graft failure 12%). An anterior position of the intra-articular exit of the tibial tunnel (in the anterior 15% of the sagittal width of the tibia) significantly (P = 0.01) increased the frequency of extension loss > 5°. Medial meniscectomy was associated with a 35% incidence of narrowing of the medial joint space, which was significantly higher compared with knees with normal menisci (9%; P - 0.04) or with medial meniscal repair (7%; P = 0.05). In conclusion this study showed satisfactory anterior stability (KT-2000 side-to-side difference up to 5 mm and pivot absent or glide) in 83% of the knees. This percentage increases to 88% in the knees with a correct posterior and proximal femoral tunnel placement. Accuracy in tunnel positioning is essential for the success of ACL surgery. Meniscal repair was effective in decreasing joint space narrowing and should be attempted when possible.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Knee injuries; Patellar ligament","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; chi square distribution; endoscopy; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee injury; male; methodology; patella; reoperation; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Chi-Square Distribution; Endoscopy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Patella; Range of Motion, Articular; Reoperation; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Surgery of the Knee Second Edition, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 4, pp. 510-516, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, A comparison between medial meniscus repair, partial meniscectomy, and normal meniscus in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 307, pp. 165-173, (1994); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Bach, Bernard Raymond, Arthroscopy-assisted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Patellar Tendon Substitution: Two- to Four-year Follow-up Results, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 6, pp. 758-767, (1994); Bradley, J., Orientation of the cruciate ligament in the sagittal plane.

Seventy-eight consecutive patients with a unilateral chronic ACL rupture reconstructed by the same surgeon using the endoscopic ""all-inside"" technique, patellar tendon autograft and interference screw fixation were included in the study. The rehabilitation followed a standard protocol. Group A included 39 patients who were supplied postoperatively with a knee brace for 4 (range 3-6) weeks. Group B included 39 patients for whom a brace was not used. The median age was 27 (range 16-48) years in group A and 26 (range 14-51) years in group B. The median time period between the injury and the index operation was 24 (range 3-150) months in group A and 18 (range 3-360) months in group B. All 78 patients were re-examined by two independent observers after a median follow-up period of 25 (range 23-28) months in group A and 24 (range 22-27) months in group B. The median KT-1000 total side-to-side difference between the reconstructed and the uninjured knees at 89 N was 3 (range -5.5-11) mm in group A and 3 (range -7-10) mm in group B (NS). When the anterior translation was tested separately at 89 N, the corresponding values were 3 (range -4-13) mm in group A and 3 (range -5-10) mm in group B (NS). The median one-leg hop quotient was 95% (range 50%-167%) of the uninjured leg in group A and 92% (range 64%-119%) in group B (NS). The median Lysholm score was 89 (range 39-100) points in group A and 85 (range 37-100) points in group B (NS). In group A, 27/39 (69%) patients and in group B 21/39 (54%) patients were classified as excellent or good (NS). The median Tegner activity level was 7 (range 3-9) in group A and 6 (range 3-9) in group B (NS). Using the IKDC scale, 27/39 (69%) in group A and 24/39 (62%) in group B were classified as normal or nearly normal (NS). The median sick leave in group A was 62 (range 0-357) days and 59 (range 0-243) days in group B (NS). No serious complications occurred during the first 6 postoperative weeks. Two serious complications were, however, registered after the 6th postoperative week. One patient in group A sustained a rupture of the reconstructed ACL 8 weeks postoperatively (3 weeks after removing the brace), and one patient in group B sustained an undislocated patellar fracture during the 7th postoperative week after a fall. This study indicates that the use of a postoperative rehabilitation brace after an arthroscopic ACL reconstruction did not appear to influence either objective stability or subjective function by the 2-year follow-up.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Bracing; Postoperative rehabilitation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; brace; evaluation; female; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; middle aged; nonparametric test; postoperative care; prospective study; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Braces; Evaluation Studies; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Care; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Statistics, Nonparametric","","","","","","","Amiel, David A., The phenomenon of “Ligamentization”: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous patellar tendon, Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 4, 2, pp. 162-172, (1986); Arnoczky, Steven Paul, Anterior cruciate ligament replacement using patellar tendon.

An extension-assisting brace was designed using a limited motion brace and an elastic strap across a fulcrum on the anterior aspect of the knee joint. The effects of the brace were investigated in 40 patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction using an autogenous central third patellar tendon graft. The patients were randomized either to use the brace in the first 6 weeks postoperatively or to undertake the same accelerated rehabilitation programme but without any brace, and they were reviewed at 4 months postoperatively. The following data were recorded: passive and active extension and flexion deficits compared with the non-operated limb, KT-1000 assessment of anterior laxity and isometric quadriceps and hamstring strength. There was no difference between the two groups for any of the recorded variables. This was largely attributed to satisfactory tunnel placement and emphasis on the restoration of extension and quadriceps function during the early postoperative rehabilitation.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Extension deficit; Extension-assisting brace","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone transplantation; brace; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; equipment design; female; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee injury; male; methodology; physiology; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Transplantation; Braces; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","Acknowledgement We acknowledge the generous support of the Australian Physiotherapy Research Foundation.","Aglietti, Paolo, Results of surgical treatment of arthrofibrosis after ACL reconstruction, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 3, 2, pp. 83-88, (1995); Am J Sports Med, (1991); Cosgarea, Andrew John, Prevention of Arthrofibrosis After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the Central Third Patellar Tendon Autograft, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 87-92, (1995); Dandy, David J., Problems in regaining full extension of the knee after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does arthrofibrosis exist?, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 2, 2, pp. 76-79, (1994); Fisher, S.

Objective evaluation at a mean of 4.1 years postoperatively included KT-1000 arthrometer stability, range of motion, and quadriceps muscle strength testing. Subjective analysis at a mean of 5.5 years postoperatively included rating of pain, stability, activity level, and a total score both preoperative and postoperative. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 28) with a follow-up ≤ 5 years (mean 3.3 years); group 2 (n = 30) with a follow-up > 5 years (mean 7.2 years). Results were analyzed by length of follow-up and by the grade and compartment of arthrosis. All patients enjoyed a full range of motion preoperatively and postoperatively. The mean KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum difference improved from a mean of 8.2 mm preoperatively to 2.4 mm postoperatively. All subjective scores showed statistically significant improvement over the preoperative values. Patients with medial compartment arthrosis reported a better subjective total score (mean 87) than patients with lateral compartment (mean 73) or bicompartmental (mean 79) arthrosis, but there was not a statistically significant difference. There was no correlation between pain, stability, or total scores and time after surgery. Patients in groups 1 and 2 had equal objective stability and similar subjective scores, but group 2 reported a lower activity level. An isolated ACL reconstruction can provide long-term stability and symptomatic pain relief in patients with chronic instability and arthrosis. The procedure has low morbidity and does not compromise future tibial osteotomy or total knee replacement.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthrosis; Chronic instability","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee injury; male; nonparametric test; osteoarthritis; patella; pathophysiology; patient satisfaction; questionnaire; tendon; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Male; Osteoarthritis; Patella; Patient Satisfaction; Questionnaires; Range of Motion, Articular; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tendons; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Allen, Paul R., Late degenerative changes after meniscectomy.

Patients had a mean age of 30 years and 5 months, and mean follow-up time was 3 years and 2 months. After statistical analysis, they concluded that: 1) ACL rupture in active patients significantly impairs the level of physical activity; 2) the kind of fixation used does not interfere with the end result; 3) the presence of meniscal lesions impairs the functional end result; 4) ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft allows the return of similar pre-injury physical activity levels.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; evaluation and follow up; female; functional assessment; human; ligament surgery; male","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01023616","","RBORB","","Portuguese","REV.

Arthrofibrosis was less common in the group with delayed reconstruction (6.1%) whereas in the primary reconstruction group the rate was 17.6%. For this reason we changed our management with regard to the timing of operation. Meniscus injuries were the most common additional injuries in both groups. Conservatively treated ACL-ruptures showed a high rate of meniscus ruptures in combination with cartilage injuries.

The IKDC and Lysholm forms and the KT 2000 were employed for clinical and lassitometric evaluation. The IKDC results were satisfactory in 60%, 72% and 67% of patients respectively, whereas the Lysholm results were 90% satisfactory in all three groups. The KT 2000 showed greater stability in the two patellar tendon groups. A higher percentage of complications and revisions occurred in the two LAD groups owing to intolerance of the artificial ligament. While each technique gave satisfactory results and no statistically significant differences emerged, it is none the less felt that reconstruction with the free patellar tendon provides the best subjective and objective outcome.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Knee; Surgical technique","","","","","","","","Bertoia, J.

The method of reconstruction used was a modification of the Brückner and Broström procedures, using the medial third of the patellar tendon tunnelled through the proximal tibia into the lateral femoral condyle and fastened with pull-out sutures. Eighty-two patients with chronic ACL insufficiency and severe symptoms of instability in spite of physiotherapy were randomly selected for reconstruction with or without a LAD. The LAD-augmented knees had the synthetic augmentation stitched to and embedded into the autogenous tissue and the composite graft was pulled through a femoral tunnel and stapled proximally. The patients were followed up regularly and the 2-year results are presented here. The outcome in both groups was good. The augmented-knee group had a larger extension deficit 1 month post-operatively compared to the non-augmented knee group but a smaller extension deficit at the 2-year follow-up. There was no difference in the median of the Lysholm knee function score but there were more patients in the non-augmented group with a lower Lysholm knee function score at the 2-year follow-up. © Munksgaard, 1996.","ACL reconstruction; LAD; Prospective; Randomized; Synthetic augmentation","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; chronic disease; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; femur; follow up; human; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; male; middle aged; patella ligament; pathophysiology; physiotherapy; prostheses and orthoses; randomized controlled trial; rotation; surgical stapling; suturing method; tibia; transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Chronic Disease; Female; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Physical Therapy Modalities; Prostheses and Implants; Range of Motion, Articular; Rotation; Surgical Stapling; Suture Techniques; Tibia; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Howe, James G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadriceps patellar tendon graft.

It is necessary to avoid lateral wall or roof encroachment on the patellar tendon graft and to avoid the pitfalls of excessive anterior placement of the femoral and tibial tunnels in order to achieve an optimum result.

Reconstruction was performed in 172 athletes with ACL-deficient knees; in 32, a quadriceps tendon-patellar tendon substitute (QTS) was used; in 79, semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (STG) were used; and in 61, a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BTB) was used. For QTS and STG autografts, a ligament augmentation device was used. Each group received the same accelerated rehabilitation program. Muscle strength was measured periodically 3-18 months after the operation, using a Cybex II dynamometer (Cybex Division of Lumex, Ronkonkoma, NY, USA). Knee extensor strength was evaluated, using the side-to-side ratio and the body weight ratio, to give a precise assessment of permissible sporting activity. After a period of 1 year, the percentage of athletes who recovered their extensor muscle strength at a level more than 80% of that in the uninvolved knee was 15.6% for those with QTS grafts, 41.0% for those with BTB grafts, and 77.9% for those with STG grafts (P < 0.001 between QTS and STG, P < 0.05 between QTS and BTB, and P < 0.001 between BTB and STG). The body weight ratio in men showed that, after reconstruction, recovery of extensor muscle strength sufficient for participation in vigorous sport required 6 months for STG grafts, 12 months for BTB grafts, and 18 months for QTS grafts. © The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Athlete; Body weight ratio; Extensor muscle strength","","","","","","","","Barrett, Gene R., Comparison of patella tendon versus patella tendon/kennedy ligament augmentation device for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Study of results, morbidity, and complications, Arthroscopy, 9, 6, pp. 624-632, (1993); Evaluation of Knee Extensor Strength for Prevention of Sports Injury, (1987); Kramer, John F., Knee flexor and extensor strength during concentric and eccentric muscle actions after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the semitendinosus tendon and ligament augmentation device, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 21, 2, pp. 285-291, (1993); Brant Lipscomb, A., Evaluation of hamstring strength following use of semitendinosus and gracilis tendons to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 6, pp. 340-342, (1982); Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); Marder, Richard A., Prospective evaluation of arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Patients with bilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, other significant knee ligament injuries, or those undergoing chondroplasty or meniscal repairs were excluded, leaving 42 patients. The relationship between radiographic tunnel position and clinical results was determined using the Lysholm score, KT-1000 arthrometer testing, the Tegner activity level, and the pivot shift and Lachman tests. Clinical results correlated positively with posterior femoral tunnel placement on lateral radiographs and negatively with excessive anterior tibial tunnel placement. Specifically, when femoral tunnels were placed at least 60% posterior along Blumensaat's line and tibial tunnels were at least 20% posterior along the tibial plateau, 69% of patients had good or excellent Lysholm scores and 79% had KT-1000 arthrometer maximum manual side-to-side differences of 3 mm or less. When the above criteria were not met, 50% of patients had good or excellent Lysholm scores and 22% had KT-1000 arthrometer maximum manual side-to-side differences of 3 mm or less. This close correlation indicates that satisfactory radiographic tunnel position influences outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; clinical article; female; fluoroscopy; human; intraoperative period; knee radiography; ligament surgery; male; patella tendon; priority journal; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Alm, Anders, Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament by using the medial third of the patellar ligament.

We used a distally based single semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft passed over the top and fixed to the femur. Combined medial collateral ligament lesions were seen in 30 knees, and they were repaired when found in the distal third (18 knees). The patients were instructed to recover motion preoperatively, and an early range of motion program was used postoperatively. At followup, symptoms of giving way were seen in five knees (7%). Graft failure was seen in seven knees (10%); failure was defined as a positive pivot shift (clunk or gross) or a side-to-side difference in anterior tibial displacement greater than 5 mm, as measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer. Permanent extension loss (3° to 5°) was found in two knees (3%). Patellofemoral crepitation was seen in eight knees (12%), but the condition was symptomatic in only one knee. Forty-six patients (67%) were active in pivoting sports before surgery and 37 (54%) remained active in these sports at followup. We concluded that this operation is simple, effective, and has a low complication rate. Further studies are necessary to elucidate if a stronger graft (e.g., a patellar tendon) would decrease the rate of graft failure without increasing complications.","","adult; arthroscopic surgery; article; clinical article; female; gracilis muscle; graft failure; human; knee; knee injury; ligament injury; ligament surgery; male; physical examination; priority journal; semitendinous muscle; surgical technique; tendon graft; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Surgery of the Knee Second Edition, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellofemoral problems after intraarticular anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 288, pp. 195-204, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Reconstruction of the chronically lax anterior cruciate ligament using the middle third of the patellar tendon.

Each leg was moved at 0.5 deg/sec into flexion or extension in a random sequence. The variables of age, KT-1000 arthrometer scores, injury-to-surgery interval, injury-to-followup interval, and patient satisfaction were statistically analyzed for correlation with threshold to perception of passive motion of the knee. Control subjects showed no statistically significant differences in threshold between their two knees. The three test groups all showed significantly higher values in the involved knee compared with the noninvolved knee (P < 0.01). However, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups, including controls, with respect to mean threshold to perception of passive motion.

The changes in the geometry of the bone tunnels were measured radiographically during the immediate postoperative period and at time intervals between 3 and 36 months after surgery. The dimensions at 1 year were correlated with the 1-year clinical results. The distance between the sclerotic margins of the tibial tunnel was measured at the distal tunnel exit on the medial tibial cortex, in the middle of the tunnel, and proximally at the level of the joint line. The dimensions were calculated by using a magnification factor determined by reference to the interference screw of known diameter located within the tunnel. The position of the centre of the tibial tunnel with regard to Blumensaat's line was also measured. The average tunnel diameter at the proximal tibial exit increased from 12 ± 1.9 mm (mean ± standard deviation) postoperatively to 14 ± 2.2 mm at 3 months. The average proximal tunnel diameter did not significantly change from 3 months to 2 years, and then decreased to 13 ± 2.4 mm at 3 years. At 1 year, most of the patterns of osteolysis were of the cone type (57%), followed by the cavity type (40%) and line type (3%). The degree of osteolysis was not related to the tibial tunnel position with respect to Blumensaat's line. There was no correlation between the changes in tunnel diameter and either the IKDC score or the residual joint laxity measured by a KT-1000 arthrometer. The aetiology of tunnel enlargement is currently unknown. Possible factors responsible for bone resorption include micromotion of the graft relative to the tunnel wall, leading to an inflammatory response in the tunnel, or stress shielding of the tunnel wall proximal to the interference screw.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Autograft; Tibial tunnel; Tunnel enlargement","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; human; injury; knee; knee injury; male; pathology; postoperative period; retrospective study; rupture; tendon; transplantation; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Humans; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Postoperative Period; Retrospective Studies; Rupture; Tendons","","","","","","","Prosthetic Ligament Reconstruction of the Knee, (1988); Djian, Patrick, Roentgenographic and magnetic resonance imaging of anterior cruciate reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft -correlations with physical findings, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, 2, 4, pp. 207-213, (1994); Fahey, Mark, Bone Tunnel Enlargement After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 3, pp. 410-414, (1994); Rev Chir Orthop, (1993); Transactions of the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, (1994); Anterior Cruciate Deficient Knee, (1987); Howell, Stephen M., Serial magnetic resonance study assessing the effects of impingement on the MR image of the patellar tendon graft, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 8, 3, pp. 350-358, (1992); Jackson, Douglas W., Intraarticular reaction associated with the use of freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized bone-patella tendon-bone allografts in the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 18, 1, pp. 1-11, (1990); Linn, R.

No complications were encountered, even though the technique itself has many pitfalls. Early recovery of function was rendered possible by the very small incision, the firm fixation of the transplant with the Kurosaka screw, and the saving of the periarticular tissues as much as possible, and no joint stiffness was observed.

We also looked on the timing of operation and the technique. We saw an overall complication rate of 21.6%. The most common complication was a restricted range of motion in 10.9% which required surgery. In patients treated immediately after injury (within 7 days) we found an arthrofibrosis rate 17.6%. In delayed surgery (more than 4 weeks after injury) this complication was only seen in 6.1%. The rate of infection was 4.6%, the rate of thrombosis 1.8% and in 4,2% we had to accept an ongoing instability. With these findings we now evaluate the needs and the social environment even more closely to find the best treatment protocol for each individual.

A standard bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft was used for the reconstruction. Pre-and intraoperative factors such as concomitant injuries, time from injury to surgery, age, sex, and tunnel placement were recorded. Tunnel placement was recorded on intraoperative radiographs of the final guide pin placement and compared to pin placement on cadaver knees. The results indicated a significant relation between early reconstruction (<1 month) following the injury and range of motion problems during the early rehabilitation period (P<0.001). This relation disappeared by the end of the first postoperative year. Prolonged surgery was also associated with early motion problems (P<0.05). Graft laxity or failure was correlated with an earlier return of range of motion (P<0.05).

The patients were reviewed to assess the clinical, KT-2000 and radiological differences at an average follow-up of 14 months (range 8-18 months). For the clinical evaluation the International Knee Documentation Committee Form was used. The following radiographic parameters were measured: (1) the direction of the femoral and tibial tunnels in the antero-posterior (AP) and lateral (LL) views; (2) the location of the anterior border of the intra-articular exit hole of the femoral tunnel in the LL radiologic view; (3) femoral interference screw divergence with the bone block. An extension loss ≤5° was detected in 40% of the double-incision and 36% of the single-incision patients (NS). A flexion loss≤10° was present in 8% of the double-incision and 16% of single-incision group (NS). There were no differences in terms of pivot shift test between the two groups (pivot glide in 12% of both groups). The average side-to-side KT-2000 differences at the manual maximum test were 1.98 mm in the double-incision and 2.64 mm in the single-incision group. With the double-incision technique the fermoral and tibial tunnels were divergent in the AP plane and crossed the joint at an angle of 37° and 72°, respectively. With the single-incision technique the bone tunnels were almost parallel and crossed the joint at an average angle of 68°. The location of the intra-articular exit of the femoral tunnel was posterior in both techniques (63% and 66%, respectively). Screw divergence (≥20°) on the femoral side was absent in the double-incision and present in 12% in the single-incision group (NS). In conclusion, even without straight line tunnels, satisfactory results in terms of stability may be obtained. Despite our similar results, we feel that the single-incision technique is perhaps preferable because there is less postoperative pain and swelling, and it is preferred by the patients. The single-incision technique has a long learning curve. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Arthroscopy; Ligament reconstruction","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; bone screw; comparative study; daily life activity; femur; follow up; human; injury; joint characteristics and functions; knee; knee meniscus; methodology; patella ligament; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative pain; radiography; sport; tibia; transplantation; walking; weight bearing; work; Activities of Daily Living; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Bone Screws; Comparative Study; Femur; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Knee Joint; Menisci, Tibial; Pain, Postoperative; Patellar Ligament; Range of Motion, Articular; Sports; Tibia; Transplantation, Autologous; Walking; Weight-Bearing; Work","","","","","","","Surgery of the Knee Second Edition, (1993); Aglietti, Paolo, Long-term study of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for chronic instability using the central one-third patellar tendon and a lateral extraarticular tenodesis, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 20, 1, pp. 38-45, (1992); Aglietti, Paolo, Patellar Tendon Versus Doubled Semitendinosus and Gracilis Tendons for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, 2, pp. 211-218, (1994); Amis, Andrew Arthur, The strength of artificial ligament anchorages.

Evaluation of the results of early mobilisation after intra-articular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Setting. Leyenburg Hospital, The Hague, Netherlands. Design. Prospective study. Method. An autologous graft of 50-60% of the patellar tendon (mid portion) was used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 50 patients (19 females, 31 males, average age 26 years). A rehabilitation programme with immediate weightbearing postoperatively without any external protection was applied. Evaluation, consisting of function and stability tests, Tegner activity level, Lysholm's function score and the subjective result, was performed 26.2 months on average after reconstruction. Results. The stability, tested manually with the KT-1000 arthrometer, was good in 45 of 50 patients, 5 had a positive pivot shift test. Only 2 patients complained of the knee giving way. In 32 of the 35 first patients no change in stability was found during observation after 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. All 50 patients regained good knee function. The result was described as 'good' in 40 of 50 patients, 'fair' in 7 and 'poor' in 3. Five of these latter 10 patients objectively had good stability of the knee. The mean time to resume activities was 5.4 weeks for full weightbearing, 10 weeks for running, 13.5 weeks for going back to work and 6 months for returning to previous sports. No patellar ruptures were seen. Conclusion. The operation used in this study and early mobilisation appear to give early knee rehabilitation without morbidity and with good stability.","","adult; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; knee surgery; ligament surgery; male; mobilization; netherlands; rehabilitation; Activities of Daily Living; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Early Ambulation; Female; Gait; Humans; Male; Patellar Ligament; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Transplantation, Autologous; Weight-Bearing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00282162","","NETJA","7877702","Dutch","NED.

Fortyeight consecutive patients with an acute proximal rupture of the ACL were included. The repairs in 22 patients were augmented with the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device (LAD), while 26 patients received a repair augmented with an autologous bone‐patellar tendon‐bone graft. All patients followed a standard rehabilitation protocol. Follow‐up evaluations at 1 and 2 years postoperatively were based on the Tegner activity level, Lysholm functional score, clinical instability tests and KT‐1000 arthrometer measurements. There were no significant differences in activity level or functional score between the LAD and patellar tendon groups at the 2‐year follow‐up. Ten patients in the LAD group (46%) sustained reruptures of the ACL and LAD at the 2‐year follow‐up, while two patients in the patellar tendon group had a KT1000 side difference of 4 mm or more. However, none of the patients in the patellar tendon group had a positive pivot shift. During the first postoperative year, 8 patients (31%) in the patellar tendon and 2 in the LAD group (9%) underwent arthroscopic debridement for correction of an extension deficit. These range of motion complications were probably related to the anterior placement of the tibial tunnel and the conservative rehabilitation protocol. Because of the unacceptable high incidence of reruptures in the LAD group, we concluded that the augmentation technique with the LAD is unacceptable. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

C., ; Kaye, M. J., ; Hosek, Ronald S., ","The objective of this study is to present a case demonstrating an accelerated method of rehabilitation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after reconstructive surgery by using a combination of aquatic and land- based therapy. A 23-year-old woman was seen 18 days after surgical reconstruction of her ACL with a patellar tendon bone graft. Examination revealed a painful, slightly swollen knee with healed incisions, swing gait, and limited ranges of motion. Because of instability, orthopedic and strength testing could not be performed. Rehabilitation was undertaken with a water- based exercise regimen accompanied by muscle stimulation, cryotherapy, and a home-based isometric program. After 2 weeks of aquatic therapy, a stabilizing brace was fitted and land-based therapy was begun. This therapy consisted of weightbearing exercises as well as a nautilus strengthening and a sport- specific exercise program. At 16 weeks' postsurgery (14 weeks of rehabilitation), no pain was present, ranges of motion were normal, strength was normal, McMurray's, AP Drawer, Slocum's and Lachman's orthopedic signs were negative, and the patient was released. A combined program of rehabilitation using water-based exercises initially followed by a land- based program may result in earlier return to preinjury status than a strictly land-based program. In this case, the patient was released 16 weeks after reconstructive ACL surgery, whereas strictly land-based programs typically take 6 to 9 months to achieve comparable outcomes. Even given the fact that this patient was a highly motivated athlete, the faster recovery seen with the combined program is very likely because the nonweightbearing aquatic therapy allows earlier mobilization and functional use of the joint, resulting in a reduced propensity for the problems associated with disuse and immobilization.","Anterior cruciate ligament; aquatic rehabilitation; land rehabilitation; sports-specific program","naproxen; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; bone graft; brace; case report; clinical protocol; cryotherapy; edema; electrostimulation therapy; female; human; hydrotherapy; knee surgery; leg exercise; ligament surgery; muscle isometric contraction; patella tendon; physiotherapy; postoperative care; skiing; sport injury; treatment outcome","","naproxen, 22204-53-1, 26159-34-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","08896976","","CHSME","","English","CHIROPR.

The operative knee in both groups, which underwent similar reconstruction of the injured knee, achieved full passive extension equal to the non- involved knee during the immediate postoperative course. The average KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum side-to-side differences were 2.4 mm for Group 1 and 2.1 mm for Group 2 (P = 0.13). Seventy- nine patients in Group 1 had KT-1000 arthrometer dif ferences of ≤3 mm as compared with 85 patients in Group 2.

Knees that had undergone previous operation or had damage to other ligaments were excluded. Four techniques were used; MacIntosh extra-articular lateral substitution alone (n = 18), extra-articular reconstruction plus intraarticular carbon fibre (n = 29), extra-articular reconstruction plus a free graft from the medial third of the patellar tendon (n = 74), or extra-articular reconstruction plus a Leeds-Keio prosthesis (n = 129). The knees were assessed 1, 3 and 6 years after reconstruction using the Lysholm score and clinical examination for the anterior drawer, Lachman and pivot shift signs. The mean Lysholm score after 6 years was 77.4 (range 31-100) in the extra-articular group; 74.4 (range 34-100) in the carbon fibre group; 95.4 (range 43-100) in the patellar tendon group; and 91.2 (range 45-100) in the Leeds-Keio group. The patellar tendon group had the highest scores (P < 0.003). The pivot shift sign returned in 39% of the extra-articular group; 48% of the carbon fibre group; 1% of the patellar tendon group, and 36% of the Leeds-Keio group. The pivot shift returned least often in the patellar tendon group (P < 0.001). There were 44% satisfactory results (pivot shift negative and Lysholm score 77 or more) in the extra-articular group; 55% in the carbon fibre group; 92% in the patellar tendon group; and 60% in the Leeds-Keio group. The patellar tendon group had the most satisfactory results (P < 0.001). ACL reconstruction using the medial third of the patellar tendon supplemented with a MacIntosh extra-articular reconstruction is a reliable technique for correcting chronic instability and allows most patients to return to their former level of activity, including professional sport. No support could be found for the use of prosthetic ligaments or the arthroscopic placement of ACL substitutes.","Anterior cruciate ligament; Knee; Ligament reconstruction; Surgery","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; conservative treatment; controlled study; female; human; intermethod comparison; knee arthroscopy; knee instability; ligament disease; ligament prosthesis; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; sport; surgical technique; tendon graft; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Chronic Disease; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Prosthesis; Male; Middle Age; Postoperative Complications; Postoperative Period; Rupture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00358843","","ARCSA","7574323","English","ANN.

This program initiated in 1987 emphasizes early full hyperextension, early weightbearing as tolerated, and closed-chain functional activities with rapid return to sports when the patient has attained full range of motion, approximately 65% of strength, and has accomplished the running and agility drills prescribed. A total of 209 patients met the criteria of KT-1000 arthrometer followup at the time full range of motion (5°/0°/135°) was attained and at 2 years or more after surgery. The KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum difference between the reconstructed and normal knees was used as the indicator of change in the graft length. All patients completed postoperative sub jective questionnaires. The mean KT-1000 arthrometer value was 2.06 mm (SD, ±2.2) at full range of motion and 2.10 mm (SD, ±1.9) at more than 2 years of fol lowup (P = 0.7961). The patients' subjective stability scores averaged 19.6 with 97% reporting no instability episodes. Based on our findings, we conclude that an accelerated rehabilitation program after this type of re construction does not affect long-term stability as meas ured by the KT-1000 arthrometer. © 1995, SAGE Publications.

Anatomic dissections in 50 knees showed the ACL sagittal central insertion point on the intercondylar floor averages 7 mm (range 7 to 8 mm) sagittally anterior to the anterior margin of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) with the knee flexed 90° such that the PCL may be used as a reliable reference landmark for locating the ACL sagittal central insertion. This constant relationship was found to be independent of knee size. Extraarticularly, beginning the tibial tunnel sagittally 1 cm above the superior (sartorial) border of the pes anserinus insertion and coronally 1.5 cm posteromedial from the medial margin of the tibial tubercle along the superior surface of the pes, directed toward the sagittal central ACL insertion, led to a sagittal tunnel-plateau angle that averaged 68°(range 64° to 72°) with a corresponding tunnel length that averaged 58 mm (range 50 to 65 mm) in 23 knees. This data correlated well with data obtained clinically in a series of 50 consecutive ACL reconstructions using intraarticular PCL and extraarticular pes anserine-medial tibial tubercle referenced tibial tunnels in which postoperative full extension lateral radiographs confirmed a sagittal tunnel-plateau angle parallel or near parallel with the intercondylar roofplateau angle in all cases averaging 68° ± 3.8°. Tibial tunnel length averaged 60 mm (range 52 to 66 mm) and in no case was there a patellar tendon autograft-tunnel length mismatch. © 1995.","ACL reconstruction; Reference landmarks; Reproducible tibial tunnel","anterior cruciate ligament; article; biomechanics; bone screw; human; knee ligament; knee radiography; ligament surgery; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; shear stress; surgical anatomy; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Bone Transplantation; Human; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Posterior Cruciate Ligament; Prospective Studies; Range of Motion, Articular; Reproducibility of Results; Tendon Transfer; Tibia","","","","","","","Hoogland, T., Intra-articular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.

A postop erative KT-1000 arthrometric evaluation revealed a mean maximum manual difference of 0.3 mm (range, -6 to +16). Ninety percent of the patients had a mean maximum difference of ≤3 mm. Three patients had a ≥5 mm mean maximum difference; positive pivot shifts were noted in two of these patients. Despite an early range of motion, early weightbearing protocol without an extraarticular backup, the pivot shift (92% negative) was reliably eliminated at postoperative followup. Ar thrometric parameters were statistically reduced (P < 0.0001) from preoperative status and were consistent with the diagnostic criteria established for normal knees.

Postoperative Tegner and Lysholm scores were not statistically different between the two groups. KT tests at 1 year showed an average 20-lb laxity of 1.8 mm for the Bioscrew and 1.2 mm for the metal screw groups. The average 1-year KT maximum manual side-to-side difference was 1.6 mm for Bioscrews and 1.6 mm for metal screws. A pivot shift was absent in 83% of Bioscrews and 90% of metal screws at follow-up. Six of 85 Bioscrews inserted (7%) broke on insertion (all were 7-mm diameter screws at the femoral site). No additional fixation was required in four cases. In two, the broken screw was replaced. No lytic bone changes or tunnel widening were found with any Bioscrew. One metal screw had tibial tunnel widening. No statistical difference was found between the Bioscrew and the metal screw groups. Short-term data support the conclusion that the Bioscrew is a reasonable alternative to metal interference screws. © 1995.","Bioscrew; Interference fixation screw; Patellar tendon autograft; Polyactic acid","absorbable suture; anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; autograft; bone screw; fracture fixation; ligament surgery; nonhuman; prosthesis loosening; tendon graft; Absorption; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroplasty; Bone Screws; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Knee Joint; Lactates; Male; Metals; Middle Age; Polymers; Prospective Studies; Tendons, Para-Articular; Transplantation, Autologous","","Lactates, 0; Metals, 0; poly(lactic acid), 26100-51-6; Polymers, 0","","","","","Lakartidningen, (1968); Gillquist, Jan, Reconstruction for old rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.

Twentytwo patients with a chronic anterior instability underwent a modified Marshall-MacIntosh procedure, while 27 with a subacute torn ACL had an ACL reconstruction using a free bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. The patients were retrospectively reviewed with a 1.8-year average followup (1-3 years). The clinical result was evaluated through the comparative range of motion and the residual laxity as measured with the KT 1000 arthrometer. The roentgenographic analysis was performed from anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) views, made first on one-leg standing with the knee at 30° of flexion, and secondly at ""zero"" extension with active quadriceps contraction. Lines were drawn to visualise the location of the tibial and femoral tunnels in relation to the tibial plateaus and the intercondylar roof represented by Blumensaat's line. The analysis of the lateral MRI views of the graft allowed discrimination between homogenous and heterogenous graft signals. On lateral roentgenograms of normal knees, it was found that Blumensaat's line crossed the surface of the medial tibial plateau at 30%±9% of its sagittal width (20%-40% range), demonstrating the variability of intercondylar roof inclination. The range of motion was normal in 34 patients (group I), 9 patients had a flexion deficit (group II), and 6 exhibited an extension deficit (group III). The residual laxity was similar in each group (P>0.05). When comparing group III to group I, patients from the former group had a tibial tunnel significantly more anterior with regard to Blumensaat's line (P=0.02). In group III, all patients exhibited a heterogenous MRI graft signal (P<0.05). and the angle between the intra-articular part of the graft and the tibial tunnel was higher (P<0.001). These findings were not observed in group II where the location only of the femoral tunnel seemed to influence the flexion deficit (P<0.05). This study demonstrated that the location of the tibial tunnel with regard to the intercondylar roof, when the knee is at ""zero"" extension, was the most relevant parameter in control of the extension deficit resulting from a graft impingement. No relation was found between the tibial tunnel location with regard to the tibial plateaus and the mobility deficit. Also, graft impingement was always associated with a heterogenous graft MRI signal. When reconstructing the ACL, care must be taken when inserting the K-wire aimed to guide the tibial drill to obtain a proper position with regard to the roof of the intercondylar notch. The K-wire location must be checked at ""zero"" extension.

The patients were divided into four groups according to the type of repair and the lapse of time between injury and operation. Twenty-five patients had undergone reconstruction with a semitendinosus tendon after acute instability (AS'T) and six, after chronic instability (CST). Eleven patients had received an acute reconstruction using the middle third of the patellar tendon (APT), as had 15 with chronic instability (CPT). The mean follow-up time was 48 months for the AST group, 60 months for the CST, 33 months for the APT, and 36 months for the CPT. In order to compare the groups, we used the Lysholm and OAK scores and the IKDC evaluation system. The only statistically significant difference found involved the IKDC evaluation system between the AST and CST groups. No significant decrease in activity level was noted in any of the groups. With the exception of the CST group, the preoperative Lachman test disappeared significantly at follow-up in all groups. The side-to-side difference of anterior tibial displacement measured with the KT 2000 at 25° knee flexion and a load of 89 newtons was 1.32 mm for the APT group, 2.44 mm for the AST group, 2.47 mm for the CPT group, and 3.33 mm for the CST group. This side-to-side difference was not significant in the APT group. In the CPT group, arthrofibrosis was found in 27% of the patients, which led to reoperation. Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using the semitendinosus is no longer indicated for chronic instability. ACL-plasty with the middle third of the patellar tendon restored practically normal stability in acute ACL insufficiency. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; controlled study; female; fibrosis; follow up; functional assessment; human; intermethod comparison; knee function; knee instability; ligament injury; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; patella tendon; priority journal; reoperation; retrospective study; scoring system; semitendinous muscle; surgical technique; tibialis anterior muscle; time; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Chronic Disease; Comparative Study; Female; Human; Joint Instability; Male; Middle Age; Orthopedics; Retrospective Studies; Rupture; Tendons, Para-Articular; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","Bonamo, John J., Rupture of the patellar ligament after use of its central third for anterior cruciate reconstruction.

From literature we can estimate a force of 200 N to be a critical limit of graft load after ACL-plasty in humans. The comparison with the graft loads under various conditions provided the following conclusions: Unlimited passive motion of the knee joint can be done without risk. Early weight bearing is possible. Active extension exercise against gravity could damage the graft in the range of 0 to 20° of flexion in some patients. A rehabilitation protocol has to regard these biomechanical principles. In a prospective study 74 patients underwent rehabilitation according to the protocol described. An extension contracture of more than 10° was seen in 9 patients. In all cases it was due to a notch-impingement or a cyclops. One year after operation 57 patients had a follow up.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: twenty one patients having a chronic anterior instability sustained a modified Marshall-Mac Intosh procedure, while 15 having a subacute torn ACL had an ACL reconstruction using a free bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. The patients were retrospectively reviewed with a 1.8 year average follow-up (1-3 years). The clinical result was evaluated through the comparative range of motion, the residual laxity as measured with the KT 1000 arthrometer, and the pivot shift test. The roentgenographic analysis was performed from AP and ML views, made first on one-leg standing with the knee at 30 degrees of flexion, and then in ""zero"" extension with active quadriceps contraction. Lines were drawn to visualise the location of the tibial and femoral tunnels in relation to the tibial plateaus and the roof of the intercondylar notch represented by the Blumensaat line. The analysis of the AP IRM views of the graft allowed to discriminate between homogeneous and heterogeneous graft signals. RESULTS: on lateral roentgenograms of normal knees it was found that the Blumensaat line crossed the surface of the medial tibial plateau at its anterior third, at 30 +/- 9 per cent (20-40 per cent range), demonstrating the variability of the intercondylar roof inclination. The range of motion was normal in 22 patients (group 1), 8 patients had a flexion deficit (group II), and 6 exhibited an extension deficit (group III). The residual laxity was similar in each group (p > 0.05). When comparing group III to group I, patients from group III had a tibial tunnel significantly more anterior with regard to the Blumensaat line (p < 0.02). In group III, all patients exhibited an heterogeneous MRI graft signal (p < 0.05), and the angle between the intraarticular part of the graft and the tibial tunnel was higher (p < 0.001). These findings were not observed in group II where the location only of the femoral tunnel seemed to influence the flexion deficit (p > 0.05). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: this study demonstrated that the location of the tibial tunnel with regard to the roof of the intercondylar notch, when the knee is in ""zero"" extension, was the most relevant parameter controlling the extension deficit resulting from a graft impingement. No relation was found between the tibial tunnel location with regard to the tibial plateaus and the mobility deficit. Graft impingement also was always associated with an heterogenous graft MRI signal. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: when reconstructing the ACL care must be taken when inserting the K-wire aimed to guide the tibial drill, to obtain a proper position with regard to the roof of the intercondylar notch. The K-wire location must be checked in ""zero"" extension.

Different techniques and materials are used to reconstruct and repair this important structure. This causes that the kind of postoperative treatment is even inhomogeneous. Concepts of 'early mobilization' correspond to the results of basic research on pathobiomechanical effects of joint immobilization. There is a large variety on the information concerning method, success and length of rehabilitation. The final aim of our research was the development of a new rehabilitation strategy for patients in addition to out-patient physiotherapy. The reconstruction and repair of ACL is in our hospital done by an autograft of patellar tendon, 'bone-tendon-bone', in augmentation with a '3-mm-Trevira cruciate ligament prosthesis'. In our prospective, controlled and randomized clinical study 'group A' (n = 20) practiced in addition to their out-patient physiotherapy twice a week under the direction of a medical doctor and the control of a physiotherapist with the equipment of a fitness-center. 'Group B' (n = 20) passed only the out-patient physiotherapy. Both groups were examined regularly with special regard to the active motion of the knee joint, the power and the circumference of the leg. Also the 'Marschall-Tegner' and the 'Lysholm-Gilquist-Score' were determined. In our study we found that the 'New-Marburg-rehabilitation-concept' is a useful supplement to the out-patient physiotherapy.

Tunnel measurement reproducibility was con firmed by independent repeated measurements. The significance of this tunnel enlargement is unknown and does not appear to adversely affect clinical outcome of allograft utilization. Possible explanations include an immune response with resorption, stress shielding proximal to the interference screw resulting in resorp tion, or an inflammatory response by synovium in the tunnel. © 1994, SAGE Publications.

The results and conclusions pre sented here are based on a retrospective clinical study evaluating the long-term outcome in 75 patients who developed infrapatellar contracture syndrome. These 75 patients (76 knees) were evaluated at an average followup of 53 months after the index (inciting) proce dure or injury. Comparing subgroups within the study population, factors that correlated with poorer results or more severe infrapatellar contracture syndrome were found to be acute anterior cruciate ligament repair or reconstruction, the use of patellar tendon autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, nonisometric graft placement, multiple surgical procedures, use of closed manipulation, and the development of patella infera. We concluded that appropriate procedures can substantially increase the range of motion in patients with infrapatellar contracture syndrome. However, re sidual functional morbidity persists in many patients, and the outcome, as determined by subjective knee function scores, is only fair. The natural history of an anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee appears to be more benign than the natural history of a knee that de velops infrapatellar contracture syndrome. © 1994, SAGE Publications.

They had undergone a reconstruction of the cruciate ligament using the patellar tendon (5 cases had received an artificial ligament) and a high tibial osteotomy. In 80 per cent of cases this was an opening osteotomy with interposition of a heterologous bone graft, and in 39 cases it was a closing osteotomy. The average age was 37 +/- 6 years. The oldest patient was 58 years old. 80 per cent of cases were men and 88 per cent of the patients practised sport on a regular basis at the time of the accident. The average delay before surgery was 9.5 years. Almost all the patients has already undergone a medial meniscectomy and there were deep cartilaginous lesions and the bone was exposed in 50 per cent of cases. 28 knees were reexamined after a follow-up of over 4 years. Based on the ARPEGE score the results on pain and stability were good. Return to sport has been possible for 43 per cent of patients. Pivot shift, which was constant before surgery (grade 2 or 3), disappeared in 20 cases and was estimated at grade 1 in 8 cases (of which 6 had suffered a rupture of the graft). For the 20 cases in which the reconstruction of the A.C.L. had held, the average anterior radiological subluxation was 4.3 +/- 3.2 mm (from 2 to 14 mm) and the average gain after surgery was 6.7 +/- 3.7 mm (from 2.5 to 18 mm). The femoro-tibial angle went from an average of 6 degrees of varus to 3 degrees of valgus. The opening osteotomy was more precise for correction in the frontal plane. A large valgus (over 3 degrees) was not desirable and a hypercorrection was occasionally difficult to accept by relatively young patients who are likely to take up sport again. The osteotomy often involuntarily modified the normal posterior tibial plateau slope (especially closing osteotomy). A backwards increase of the tibial plateau slope is a factor which increases the anterior subluxation of the femur on the tibia. This is confirmed before and after surgery. It seems preferable to decrease the tibial slope during the osteotomy in order to protect the A.C.L. reconstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; arthritis; article; female; follow up; human; injury; joint instability; knee; knee injury; male; osteotomy; plastic surgery; rupture; tibia; time; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthritis; English Abstract; Evaluation Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Joint Instability; Knee Injuries; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Age; Osteotomy; Rupture; Surgery, Plastic; Tibia; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00351040","","","8066285","French","Rev Chir Orthop Reparatrice Appar Mot","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-3142639944"

D., Cattedra di Radiologia, Università di Pisa, Pisa, PI, Italy","MRI of the knee was performed in 30 patients who had been submitted to arthroscopically-guided reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament from patellar tendon. The autograft structure was investigated and MR results were correlated with clinical findings. Partial/total meniscectomy had been carried out in 21/30 cases. The patients were imaged at various postoperative intervals (3-24 months) by means of an 0.5-T magnet (GE MR Max Plus) in full knee extension and internal rotation. Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images (slice thickness: 3 mm) were combined with real-time reconstruction which better demonstrated the whole graft. T2-weighted coronal images (slice thickness: 5 mm) were also acquired. In each patient the following clinical variables were considered: anterior drawer sign, Lachman test, pivot shift, degree of leg extension, and finally functional recovery. The following MR variables were then considered: structure and alignment of bone tunnels, structure and signal intensity of the graft, degree of synovial inflammation, structure and signal intensity of the posterior cruciate ligament and finally structure of the menisci and/or meniscal residues. Symptoms-MR correlation suggests that the different outcome of surgical reconstruction may depend on the correct alignment of the tibial and femoral bone tunnels and on good meniscal condition. Bone tunnels must be located on the same plane, posterior and parallel to the slope of the intercondylar roof, since angulation causes the latter to impact the graft during knee extension, with inflammation and risk for rupture. As for menisci, tiny residues or total ablation overload tha graft, whose signal increases and whose synovia becomes inflamed. The latter pattern is always distinguished from that of the autograft, whose signal intensity seems not to change in time. In conclusion, MR proved an accurate and non-invasive technique to image this kind of postoperative knee, since metallic artifacts do not reach the joint space.","","anterior cruciate ligament; arthroscopy; article; autotransplantation; follow up; human; instrumentation; knee meniscus; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella; pathology; tendon; time; transplantation; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; English Abstract; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Menisci, Tibial; Patella; Tendons, Para-Articular; Time Factors; Transplantation, Autologous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00338362","","","8346360","Italian","Radiol Med (Torino)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027632964"

The vitality of the graft shall be assessed by the measurement of the blood circulation as well as by histologic investigation and clinical evaluation. Methods In 10 patients the intraligamentary blood circulation was arthroscopically determined by laser flowmetry 8 to 12 months postoperatively and compared with a control group with uninjured anterior cruciate ligament. At the same time probes were taken out of the graft. For clinical assessment 34 patients were investigated 3.5 years after procedure on average and evaluated according to Lysholm-and HSS-score. After having proved the accuracy of the manual assessment of the joint stability by a comparison with a computer-aided test system, the stability control was exclusively performed by clinical investigation. Results The blood circulation of the grafts measured by flowmetry was only a tenth of that of healthy anterior cruciate ligaments. The histologic investigation showed vital tendon tissue with well ordered formation of fibres, partially interspersed by scar tissue and myxoid degeneration. The clinical investigation showed a stable joint in 85.3% of the patients. 88.3% of the patients were classified ""good"" in Lysholm, 85.3% in HSS-score. Conclusion The free patellar tendon graft is considered to be vital both by measurement of the blood circulation and by histologic investigation. Nevertheless it is only a substitution tissue with a minor load bearing capacity.

Group II was composed of 50 patients (24 acute, 26 chronic) who underwent an identical surgical procedure except that the LAD was not used. Objective and subjective assessments were made throughout the postoperative course, with the longest follow-up an average of 24 months postoperatively. Statistical analysis of these findings failed to show any statistically significant differences between the groups.

Sixty-four re constructions, using a distally attached medial one-third patellar tendon, were reviewed on an average of 46 months postoperatively. After surgery, the timing of return to vigorous activity was based on biologic fixa tion of the graft, a negative Lachman test, absence of effusion, and the patient's desire to return to previous activity. The 64 patients were retrospectively separated into two groups. The early group consisted of 31 patients who returned to activity 2 to 6 months after reconstruc tion, and the late group consisted of 33 patients who returned to activity 7 to 14 months after reconstruction. By clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer meas urements, subjective evaluation, and Cybex testing, there were no differences between the early and late return groups except for reestablishment of final range of motion.

Fifty-two consecutive arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstructions (Group I) were matched with 52 miniarthrotomy ACL reconstructions (Group II). An autogenous midthird patellar tendon was used in all reconstruction procedures. Group I patients were operated on by one surgeon (A.C.R.) and all Group II patients by another (K.D.S.). Both groups were similar with regard to age, sex, injury, chronicity, and previous knee surgical procedures. All patients were treated according to the same postoperative rehabilitative protocol (emphasizing early motion, immediate full passive extension, early functional activity) and evaluated on follow-up by the same personnel and protocol. Data collection included injury and surgery dates; total surgery and tourniquet times; length of hospital stay; drain output; inpatient pain medications used; follow-up range of motion at 1.5, 2.5, and 6 weeks postoperative; KT-1000 arthrometer measurements at 10, 16, and 26 weeks; and isokinetic measurements at 10 and 16 weeks postoperative. Results indicated that follow-up range of motion and KT-1000 measurements showed no statistical difference between groups. Isokinetic average scores for quadriceps strength at 180°/s showed no differences at 10 and 16 weeks. The study suggested that ACL reconstructtion with midthird patellar tendon performed by skilled surgeons using either open or arthroscopic-assisted techniques combined with an aggressive postoperative rehabilitation protocol will yield similar acceptable early clinical results. © 1993, Arthroscopy Association of North America.

Ninety-one young (x = 25.4 years), active patients were available for an average follow-up of 36.4 months and included 55 patients in the PAT group and 36 in the DST&G group. No patients had previously undergone ACL reconstruction. Knee stability data were obtained yearly and included scores from the Lysholm questionnaire, Lachman exam, and KT-1000 arthrometer at 30 pounds (KT30) and maximum pull (KTMAX). Both autografts were of comparable size, tension, and isometricity. Two separate factorial multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were used to compare the two series for 3 follow-up years in the categories acute and chronic (A versus C) and meniscectomy and no meniscectomy (M versus NM). Results indicated that in all categories and follow-up years, PAT patients had consistently greater knee stability compared with the DST&G group. Overall MANOVA results showed significantly lower (p < 0.01) Lachman scores in PAT versus DST&G in each of the 3 follow-up years. Significantly lower (p < 0.05) KT30 and KTMAX values were also observed for PAT compared with DST&G in year 1. MANOVA results also showed lower (p < 0.01) Lachman scores in PAT-A versus DST&G-A for 3 follow-up years. Lachman scores in PAT-NM patients were lower (p < 0.01) for postop years 1 and 2 compared with DST&G-NM. PAT-C and PAT-M patients had greater but insignificant (p > 0.01) knee stability compared with DST&G-C and DST&G-M patients, respectively. Strict criteria were established to rate success for 3 postoperative years. The DST&G series had 94%, 83%, and 81% success rates compared with 98%, 96%, and 96% in PAT over 3 years, respectively. These results indicate that both grafts are good choices in ACL reconstruction, but the PAT graft provides more overall knee stability than DST&G. © 1993, Arthroscopy Association of North America.

We determined the correlations be tween the initial onset of abnormal displacements (greater than 2.5 mm between limbs) and time from surgery or the phase of rehabilitation. Group 1 (N = 52) had a bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft and Group 2 (N = 32), an iliotibial band extraar ticular procedure in addition to the allograft. The mean followup was 37 months (range, 23 to 65). At followup in Group 1, 24 patients (46%) had less than 3 mm of displacement between limbs, 22 (42%) had 3 to 5.5 mm, and 6 (12%) had greater than 5.5 mm. In Group 2, 23 patients (72%) had less than 3 mm of displacement, 8 (25%) had 3 to 5.5 mm, and 1 (3%) had greater than 5.5 mm. The difference between the groups was significant (P < 0.05). The advanced rehabilitation program of immediate knee motion and early weightbearing, did not result in an increased incidence of abnormal displacements in the early phases. The abnormal displacements typically occurred during the latter two rehabilitation phases (intensive strength training or return to sports). Further, one-third of the abonormal displacement occurred more than 2 years postoperatively. © 1993, SAGE Publications.

Muscle performance was analyzed in 49 patients (23 PT, 26 LK. There was no difference between the two groups in anthropometry, activity levels (before trauma; present; desired activity), time from trauma to surgery, or time from surgery to follow-up evaluation. Neither the concentric and eccentric knee extensor peak torque ratio nor the knee extensor endurance and the one-leg hop test differed between the two groups. However, both the pivot-shift and the anterior laxity were significantly greater for the LK group. On the other hand, significantly more patients in the PT group had an extensor lag.

All patients had radiographic evidence of posttraumatic arthritis. Thirty- three patients met our criteria for inclusion in the study. Time from injury to reconstruction of the anterior cru ciate ligament averaged 105 months. All patients under went an accelerated rehabilitation program designed to help them regain full range of motion as soon as pos sible. Preoperative and postoperative range of motion, strength, stability, and subjective evaluations were compared. Followup averaged 44.8 months. Follow-up range of motion was not significantly different from preoperative measurements (P = 0.51). Postoperative stability, as measured by KT-1000 arthrometer maxi mum manual test, averaged 2.7 mm versus 8.4 mm preoperatively (P < 0.001). Isokinetic testing revealed no difference in the quadriceps strength after recon struction (P = 0.99). Patients’ subjective scores on a modified Noyes questionnaire improved for pain, sta bility, and activity level, with a total improvement from 55 to 81 points. Although the procedure and rehabili tation were successful in providing stability and de creasing pain, patients were still encouraged to limit high-impact athletic and occupational activity. © 1993, SAGE Publications.

Recently, CPM devices have been therapeutically employed immediately after autogenous patellar tendon reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Whereas the concept of early motion is indicated, there is a concomitant concern that the implementation of immediate passive motion may stretch or rupture the graft. Twenty subjects scheduled to undergo ACL reconstruction were randomized into two groups (10 CPM and 10 non-CPM). All subjects performed the same postoperative rehabilitation with the exception of the CPM. Objective anterior tibial translation measurements were recorded with a KT-1000 for a 30-1b (133.5-N) Lachman test at 1 year postreconstruction. The results of this study indicated that the implementation of immediate continuous passive motion did not have any deleterious effects on the stability of the ligament reconstruction.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; autograft; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; joint laxity; knee arthroplasty; male; patella tendon; physiotherapy; postoperative care; randomized controlled trial; tendon graft","","","","","","","Akeson, Wayne H., The connective tissue response to immobility: biochemical changes in periarticular connective tissue of the immobilized rabbit knee, CLIN.ORTHOP., 93, pp. 356-362, (1973); Acta Chir Scand, (1974); Blackburn, Turner A.T., Rehabilitation of anterior instability of the knee, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, 1, 2, pp. 132-145, (1992); Blackburn, Turner A.T., Rehabilitation of anterior cruciate ligament injuries, Orthopedic Clinics of North America, 16, 2, pp. 241-269, (1985); Burks, Robert T., The effect of continuous passive motion on anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction stability, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 12, 4, pp. 323-327, (1984); Jnata, (1991); Coutts, Richard D., Continuous passive motion in the rehabilitation of the total knee patient, its role and effect, Orthopaedic Review, 15, 3, pp. 126-134, (1986); Orthop Tran, (1983); Daniel, Dale M., Instrumented measurement of anterior laxity of the knee, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 67, 5, pp. 720-726, (1985); Dehne, Ernest, Treatment of joint injuries by immediate mobilization.

Seventy-one patients were studied prospectively following bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction. Subjects were divided into six subgroups relative to the integrity (intact, partial meniscectomy, complete meniscectomy) of the two menisci. After a minimum of 2 years of follow-up (range 2–4.1 years), 56 subjects were available for subjective, objective, and radiographic assessment. Meniscal status at the time of ACL reconstruction proved to have no significant bearing on the ultimate stability of the knee. However, individuals who had undergone meniscal excision reported subjective complaints and activity limitations more commonly than those with intact menisci (p < 0.05). Radiographic changes also were more common in the meniscectomized subset. © 1993, Arthroscopy Association of North America. All rights reserved.

An additional goald was to analyze the effect of the sagittal placement of the tibial tunnel placement on knee extension and stability. Two groups were defined by comparing the sagittal relationship of the tibial tunnel to the slope of the intercondylar roof from a lateral roentgenogram of the knee in full extension. The roof impinged group consisted of nine patients who had the tibial tunnel placed anterior to the tibial intersection of the slope of the intercondylar roof. The unimpinged group was composed of eleven patients who had the tibial tunnel placed posterior and parallel to the slope of the intercondylar roof. MR scans were obtained at 0-2, 12, 24, 36, and >48 weeks postoperatively. The signal intensities of grafts in both groups were identical at 1 week, but increased in the impinged group by 3 months and remained increased at 12 months postoperatively (p < 0.01). In contrast, the MR signal of grafts in the unimpinged group remained unchanged during the first year. Knees with impinged grafts had extension deficits but remained stable. Roof impingement was impossible to view directly with the knee in full extension. Positioning the tibial tunnel posterior and parallel to the slope of the intercondylar roof in the extended knee and using an impingment rod to indirectly assess roof impingement avoided the extension deficits and MR signal increases characteristic of an impinged graft. The clinical relevance is that the surgeon controls the MR appearance of the graft and the severity of extension deficits by deciding where to place the tibial tunnel and when to perform a roofplasty. Avoiding roof impingement is difficult because of the inability to directly judge the adequacy of a roofplasty. © 1992.","Graft; Impingement; Knee; Magnetic resonance; Patellar tendon grafts","adolescent; adult; article; autograft; clinical article; diagnostic accuracy; female; graft preservation; graft survival; hamstring; human; implantation; joint laxity; knee function; knee instability; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; risk assessment; tendon graft; Acute Disease; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Arthroscopy; Female; Human; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Patella; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Period; Tendons","","","","","","","Moeser, Phillip M., MR imaging of anterior cruciate ligament repair, Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, 13, 1, pp. 105-110, (1989); Howell, Stephen M., Serial magnetic resonance imaging of hamstring anterior cruciate ligament autografts during the first year of implantation: A preliminary study, American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 1, pp. 42-47, (1991); Howell, Stephen M., Unimpinged and impinged anterior cruciate ligament grafts: MR signal intensity measurements, Radiology, 179, 3, pp. 639-643, (1991); undefined; Rak, Kevin M., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Evaluation with MR imaging, Radiology, 178, 2, pp. 553-556, (1991); Clancy, William G., Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using one-third of the patellar ligament, augmented by extra-articular tendon transfers, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery - Series A, 64, 3, pp. 352-359, (1982); Howell, Stephen M., A rationale for predicting anterior cruciate graft impingement by the intercondylar roof: A magnetic resonance imaging study, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 19, 3, pp. 276-282, (1991); Lysholm, Jack, Evaluation of knee ligament surgery results with special emphasis on use of a scoring scale, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 10, 3, pp. 150-154, (1982); Sachs, Raymond A., Patellofemoral problems after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 17, 6, pp. 760-765, (1989); Tanzer, Michael, The relationship of intercondylar notch size and content to notchplasty requirement in anterior cruciate ligament surgery, Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, 6, 2, pp. 89-93, (1990)","","","","","","","","","07498063","","ARTHE","1418208","English","Arthroscopy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026700550"

Of 800 patients who underwent intraarticular ACL patellar tendon- bone graft reconstruction, performed by the same surgeon, the last 450 patients have followed the accelerated rehabilitation schedule as outlined in the protocol. A longer than 2 year followup is recorded for 73 of the patients in the accelerated rehabilitation group. On the 1st postoperative day, we encouraged these patients to walk with full weightbearing and full knee extension. By the 2nd postoperative week, the patients with a 100° range of motion participated in a guided exercise and strengthening program. By the 4th week, patients were permitted unlimited activities of daily living and were allowed to return to light sports activities as early as the 8th week if the Cybex strength scores of the involved extremity exceeded 70% of the scores of the noninvolved extremity and the patient had completed a sport-specific functional/agility program. The patient database was compiled from frequent clinical examinations, periodic knee questionnaires, and objective information, such as range of motion measurements, KT-1000 values, and Cybex strength scores. A series of graft biopsies obtained at various times have revealed no adverse histologic reaction. The evidence indicates that in this population, the accelerated rehabilitation program has been more effective than our initial program in reducing limitations of motion (particularly knee extension) and loss of strength while maintaining stability and preventing anterior knee pain.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; female; follow up; human; kinesiotherapy; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; weight bearing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01906011","","JOSPD","","English","J.

The patients were randomly selected 12 to 24 months after reconstruction. All had rehabilitation where range of motion was initiated within the 1st postoperative week. All patients stated that they were satisfied and considered their knee to be stable. The KT-1000 maximum measurements (30 to 40 pounds) averaged an increase of 1.7 mm when compared with the opposite knee. Subjective complaints, such as anterior knee pain, grating, and weakness, were common and only 3 of 10 patients returned to all of their preinjury sports. Persistent radiographic abnormalities were common. Physical examination and functional testing also revealed persistent dysfunction of the extensor mechanism in patients with radiographic abnormalities. Isokinetic testing at 60 deg/sec showed an average quadriceps deficit of 18% compared to the normal extremity. Axial computed tomography scans revealed significant decrease in quadriceps cross-sectional area. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography confirmed persistent defects at the harvest site; there was significant anterior knee scar formation in these patients. Despite achieving ligamentous stability, patients still experienced permanent weakness, functional deficits, patellar chondrosis, and pain after ACL reconstruction using the central one-third of the patellar tendon.","","adult; arthralgia; arthroscopy; article; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; extensor muscle; female; human; knee function; knee instability; knee radiography; ligament surgery; male; morbidity; muscle strength; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patella tendon; postoperative period; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; rehabilitation; tendon graft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","1443318","English","AM.

From February 1983 through December 1989, 84 of 90 consecutive patients were available for followup (mini mum, 1 year; mean, 3.1 years) with a combined anterior cruciate ligament-medial collateral ligament injury (an terior cruciate ligament rupture and medial collateral ligament tear) received surgical management by the same physician. The last 68 of these 84 patients who met the inclusion criteria underwent patellar tendon graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, with concomitant nonoperative management of medial col lateral ligament tears. Follow-up evaluation consisted of physical examina tion for medial laxity, range of motion, and isokinetic and KT-1000 testing. Brace use and postoperative level of competition were also recorded. In addition, the patients completed a subjective assessment question naire rating pain, swelling, and stability. They also rated overall activity level, and any changes in their ability to do the activities tested: walk, climb stairs, run, jump, or twist. Our results indicate that proper reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, in conjunction with nonoperative management of tears of the medial collat eral ligament in combined anterior cruciate ligament- medial collateral ligament injuries, can give excellent stability and good to excellent functional outcome in patients with combined anterior cruciate ligament-me dial collateral ligament injuries. © 1992, SAGE Publications.

All of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions used the middle third of the ipsilateral patellar tendon autograft. Patients undergoing meniscal repair, extraarticular procedures, or repair of other ligaments were excluded. The 75 patients were divided into subgroups to assess the benefits or disadvantages of early active motion (25 patients), continuous passive motion (25 patients), and a combination of both (25 patients) during the first 30 days after surgery. All patients were evaluated at specific intervals for 6 months after surgery. Data recorded included drain output, medication usage, tourniquet time, leg involved, hospital stay length, KT-1000 testing (before surgery in the anesthetized patient, after the procedure was completed, and 2 and 6 months after surgery), and range of motion. Radiographs and the International Knee Evaluation Form were also used to evaluate the results. No statistically significant differences were found between the three groups. Side-to-side anterior-posterior differences, stability, and restoration of full range of motion were similar in each subgroup at each evaluated interval. In this prospective study of motion, started immediately after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, passive and active methods were shown to have identical results. A supervised active and passive motion program during the 1st month had the same results as either one used individually.","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; human; immobilization; knee arthroscopy; knee injury; ligament surgery; major clinical study; male; motion; priority journal; tendon graft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","1558237","English","AM.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were performed on 13 anatomic specimen knees using bone/patellar tendon/bone grafts. Nine ACL substitutions were considered isometric with maximum graft length changes of less than 1 mm. Four ACL substitutions were nonisometric with graft length changes of 3 mm or greater resulting from tightening in flexion. The specimens were subjected to CPM through 0°-95° knee flexion. Knee stability was remeasured with a knee arthrometer at three and 14 days after beginning CPM. All four nonisometric specimens had failed within three days, with increased anterior laxity of 2-9 mm in both the Lachman (20°) and anterior drawer (90°) positions. All nine isometric reconstructions successfully retained pre-CPM anterior stability within 1 mm after 14 days of CPM. This investigation illustrates the importance of isometric graft placement for ACL reconstruction success. Continuous passive motion does not appear to adversely affect immediate ACL- substitute integrity or fixation if graft placement is isometric (less than 1 mm of graft excursion through 0°-110° of knee motion). Continuous passive motion may cause graft deformation, fixation failure, or both, with resultant loss of knee stability if the graft is not isometrically positioned (greater than 3 mm of graft excursion resulting from tightening in flexion).","","anterior cruciate ligament; article; bone graft; human; human tissue; joint function; joint laxity; knee instability; ligament surgery; priority journal; tendon graft; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biometry; Bone Transplantation; Human; Joint Instability; Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tendons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0009921X","","CORTB","1555343","English","CLIN.

The average age at surgery was 21 years (range, 16 to 33). A postoperative cast was used for 4 weeks.

In 25 patients (57%), stability was restored within normal limits (≤3 mm). No deterioration of the KT-1000 stability was noted at two follow-up visits performed by the same examiner (at an average of 4 and 7 years).

Moderate radiographic changes were noted in eight patients (18%) at followup and correlated with meniscectomy and pain. Overall satisfactory results were obtained in this initial experience in 29 (66%) of the patients.

The pivot-shift was eliminated in 93% of the cases and the maximum manual test performed with the KT-1000 arthrometer was less than or equal to 5 mm in 83%. Lateral compartment laxity which was not corrected at operation was frequently associated with graft failure (p = 0.01). Seven patients had difficulty in rehabilitation, and in 6 of these the final result was unsatisfactory. Pain and swelling in the femoropatellar joint were present in 8% of the cases. Slight and moderate degenerative changes were shown on the radiographs in 48% and 10% of the patients, respectively, at follow-up; these findings correlated with meniscectomy (p less than 0.001) and rehabilitation problems (p = 0.03). This procedure achieved lasting, satisfactory results in 70% of the cases. Additional advances include greater care in positioning the graft, use of arthroscopy, and early mobilization. Further studies are needed to verify the advantages of these new techniques.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament; article; female; follow up; human; joint characteristics and functions; joint instability; knee; male; pathophysiology; tendon transfer; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Joint Instability; Knee; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendon Transfer; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1816153","English","Ital J Orthop Traumatol","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026308326"

However, numerous aspects regarding both technique and postoperative rehabilitation can still be improved. The aim of this study was to measure the elongation of the patellar tendon in vivo in the operating room after reconstructive surgery, subjecting the knee to normal strain such as passive mobilization or anterior displacement of the tibia. Three volunteers were studied. Our results were different from those reported in a previous study conducted in vivo on a normal anterior cruciate ligament (ACE). In spite of the isometric position of the tendon, passive mobilization provoked a progressive increase in the elongation of the graft within each cycle of flexion-extension and between one cycle and the next. This also occurred during the Lachman test. These findings suggest that the graft undergoes a process of tensile adjustment when it is first put under strain. Continued elongation once this process appears stabilized raises doubts as to the reliability of isometric measuring devices.","","elongation factor; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; male; normal human; patella tendon; plastic surgery; Adult; Anterior Cruciate Ligament; Biomechanics; Female; Human; Knee Joint; Male; Motion Therapy, Continuous Passive; Patella; Range of Motion, Articular; Tendons, Para-Articular; Transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IJOTD","1797727","English","ITAL.

A standard rehabilitation regimen was used for all patients after surgery including immediate passive knee extension, early stationary cycling, protected weightbearing for 6 weeks, avoidance of resisted terminal knee extension until 6 months, and return to activity at 10 to 12 months postoperatively. Seventy-two patients were evaluated at a minimum of 24 months postoperatively (range, 24 to 40 months). No significant differences were noted between groups with respect to subjective complaints, functional level, or objective laxity evaluation, including KT-1000 measurements. Seventeen of 72 patients (24%) experienced anterior knee pain after ACL reconstruction. Overall, 46 of 72 patients (64%) returned to their preinjury level of activity.

Recent reports on nonoperative treatment have shown poor results. Results after primary repair have deteriorated with time, leading to augmentation procedures that seem to have improved the results. However, there have been few prospective, randomized studies in this field. Our goal was to compare primary repair with a bone-patellar tendon-bone augmentation method and with a new method using the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device. One hundred fifty patients aged 16 to 50, all of whom had acute ACL tears, were randomized with the closed envelope method to one of three groups treated with open surgical methods. Fifty patients were treated with primary repair, 50 patients with patellar tendon augmentation, and 50 patients were augmented with the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device. All patients were operated on within 10 days of injury. The rehabilitation protocol was identical, consisting of a long leg cast for 2 weeks, followed by a brace with no weight-bearing and limited motion for 6 weeks. The patients were followed prospectively by one surgeon (LE) using the Lysholm functional score, Tegner activity level score, clinical evaluation and KT-1000 arthrometer at 6 months, 1, and 2 years. Three patients were lost to followup. There was no age or activity level difference between the groups. Sport activities led to 85% of the injuries, with skiing, soccer, and European handball representing 80% of injuries. All three groups reduced their activity level the 1st year. The repair group remained at the same level after 2 years. The Ligament Augmentation Device group had a small increase, while the patellar tendon group had a significant increase to almost the preinjury level. The patellar tendon group was judged to have results superior to the other groups, according to Lachman, pivot shift, and KT-1000 test results. The Ligament Augmentation Device group fared better than the primary repair group, according to the Lysholm score, Lachman test, and pivot shift. In general, the results were as follows: the repair group deteriorated from 1 to the 2 years control, the Ligament Augmentation Device group did not change, and the patellar tendon group improved.","","adolescent; adult; anterior cruciate ligament rupture; conference paper; follow up; human; knee ligament injury; major clinical study; priority journal; sport injury; surgical technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","2285086","English","AM.

Grafts were subsequently analyzed for rate of collagen synthesis, collagen content, collagen type, histologic change, and cyanogen bromide cleavage patterns of collagen to closely assess the nature of collagen in tendon grafts up to 2 years from the time of transplan tation. Tendon grafts were placed in rabbit knees as free fragments or were attached to synovium. These studies show that tendon grafts, even without vascularization or stress, remain viable after intraartic ular transfer. Vascularization produces a trend toward increased collagen synthesis, but statistical analysis suggests that control levels of collagen synthesis con tinue after tendon transfers into rabbit knees. Cyanogen bromide cleavage peptides showed appropriate colla gen formed by unstressed autogenous tendon trans plants removed from rabbit knees up to 2 years from transplantation. All tendon grafts degenerated initially, but began to form histologically healthy looking con nective tissue by 18 to 24 weeks after transplantation. Overall, the results are encouraging with regard to the fate of intraarticular tendon grafts. © 1990, SAGE Publications.

Of 800 patients who underwent intraarticular ACL patellar tendon-bone graft reconstruction, performed by the same surgeon, the last 450 patients have followed the accelerated rehabilitation schedule as outlined in the protocol. A longer than 2 year followup is recorded for 73 of the patients in the accelerated rehabilitation group. On the 1 st postoperative day, we encouraged these patients to walk with full weightbearing and full knee extension. By the 2nd postoperative week, the patients with a 100° range of motion participated in a guided exercise and strengthening program. By the 4th week, patients were permitted unlimited activities of daily living and were allowed to return to light sports activities as early as the 8th week if the Cybex strength scores of the involved extremity exceeded 70% of the scores of the noninvolved extremity and the patient had completed a sport-specific functional/agility pro gram. The patient database was compiled from fre quent clinical examinations, periodic knee question naires, and objective information, such as range of motion measurements, KT-1000 values, and Cybex strength scores. A series of graft biopsies obtained at various times have revealed no adverse histologic re action. The evidence indicates that in this population, the accelerated rehabilitation program has been more effective than our initial program in reducing limitations of motion (particularly knee extension) and loss of strength while maintaining stability and preventing an terior knee pain. © 1990, SAGE Publications.

We used an experimental knee testing system to analyze the immediate postoperative mechanical effect of an iliotibial band tenodesis on an intraarticular recon struction of the ACL in fresh cadaver knees using a composite graft consisting of a bone-patellar tendon- bone segment augmented with the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device (LAD, 3M Co., St. Paul, MN). The intraarticular graft was standardized by using a force- setting technique. Ligament and graft forces were measured using buckle transducers, and joint motion was measured using an instrumented spatial linkage as 90 N anteriorly directed tibial loads were applied to seven fresh knee specimens at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion. The following knee states were tested in each specimen: intact ACL, excised ACL, intraarticular reconstruction, intraarticular reconstruction with the tenodesis added, and tenodesis with the intraarticular reconstruction added. Adding the iliotibial band tenodesis to an existing standardized intraarticular reconstruction significantly decreased the force in the ACL composite graft by an average of 43%. When the standardized intraarticular reconstruction was added to an existing tenodesis, the graft forces were an average of 15% below the level of when the reconstruction was performed alone. The force in the tenodesis was significantly less than the composite graft force at extension; however, the differ ences between the tenodesis and total graft force were not significant from 30° to 90° of flexion. Load sharing appeared to occur between the tenodesis and intraar ticular graft. The tenodesis caused the tibia to be in an externally rotated configuration relative to normal, po tentially interfering with the “screw home mechanism.”. © 1990, SAGE Publications.

All were treated with ligament excision and intraarticular bone-patellar tendon-bone recon struction followed by early motion with emphasis on full extension. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 7 years. Of the 155 patients, 140 were available for final followup at a minimum of 2 years after reconstruction. The patients were evaluated by objective measures (KT-1000, Cybex, Lachman test, range of motion, and postoperative competition level) and subjective assess ment scores (pain, swelling, stability, activity level, walk ing, stair climbing, running, jumping, or twisting). The subjective scores were tabulated for stability level, total score, and activity level. After the patients achieved full range of motion, the KT-1000 measurements at a 20 pound force revealed an average difference of 1.3 mm between the injured and noninjured knees. All but 3 of the 140 patients had a firm endpoint on the Lachman test, and the Cybex tests showed a mean hamstring strength of 98% and mean quadriceps strength of 90%. Sixty of the 69 varsity athletes who were eligible to play returned to preinjury competition level the following season. One had reconstruction failure and eight chose not to con tinue competition for academic reasons. The question naire score average was 92.7 (maximum, 100 points, normal athletic knee score 93.5). We concluded that the surgical procedure, with em phasis on early full extension postoperatively, achieved excellent results and provided a stable knee. © 1990, SAGE Publications.

We also determined the anterior tibial displacement and anterior compliance, using the Lachman test. The subjects were divided into groups according to the type of autogenous intra-articular substitute (either the central one-third of the patellar tendon or the semitendinosus tendon) that had been used for the anterior cruciate ligament and according to the duration of follow-up (range, twenty-four to 101 months). Lachman tests were performed, applying sixty-eight and ninety newtons of force, and indices for anterior compliance were calculated. Although significantly more anterior laxity was demonstrated with both sixty-eight and ninety newtons of force in the reconstructed knees than in the contralateral, normal knees (p < 0.001), thirteen subjects, of whom eight lacked full extension of the reconstructed knee, had more anterior laxity in the normal knee. Analyses of variance showed no significant differences in the results of the Lachman tests as related to either the type of reconstruction or the length of postoperative follow-up. The results suggested that the two types of ligamentous substitute that were used in this study were equally efficient in limiting anterior tibial displacement, as demonstrated by the Lachman test. The study also demonstrated that the substitutes did not elongate significantly during the period of the study.","","adult; anterior cruciate ligament; biomechanics; clinical article; female; human; knee arthroplasty; knee function; knee ligament injury; male; medical instrumentation; methodology; priority journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00219355","","JBJSA","2760093","English","J.

The choice of treatment was determined entirely by whether the result of a pivot-shift test was graded as absent, trace, or mild (non-operative treatment) or as moderate or severe (surgical treatment). Surgical treatment consisted of primary repair of the torn ligament and augmentation with a patellar tendon graft. Twenty-two patients were treated non-operatively, and the results were evaluated after twenty-four to eighty-two months (average, forty-eight months). Seventy patients were treated surgically, and fifty-two of them (approximately 70 per cent) returned for follow-up after twenty-four to 100 months (average, forty-eight months); an additional eighteen patients answered a questionnaire. In the non-operative group, about half of the results were graded as excellent or good and half, as fair or a failure. In the surgical group, all but two of the patients had an excellent or a good result; two patients had a fair result. No result was graded as a failure. The results of this study suggest that when the pivot-shift test is not strongly positive, half of the patients will do reasonably well after treatment with a non-operative program of functional rehabilitation. The patients in this study who had a more unstable knee had far better results after a repair and augmentation procedure than have been previously reported after primary repair alone.","","anterior cruciate ligament rupture; arthroscopy; arthrotomy; conservative treatment; diagnosis; human; major clinical study; methodology; priority journal; surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00219355","","JBJSA","3198673","English","J.

Ten fresh-frozen cadaver knees underwent arthroscopy and were determined to have intact anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and both menisci. A knee arthrometer (model KT 1000, MedMetric Corp., San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) was used to determine the anteroposterior translation with a 20 lb load. The anterior cruciate ligament was arthroscopically sectioned, and a repeat arthrometer measurement was made. Isometric points in the femur and tibia were determined using a tension isometer before drilling bony tunnels. The central third patellar tendon (bone-tendon-bone) complex, semitendinosus that was doubled on itself, and an iliotibial band approximately 3 cm wide were harvested. The grafts were separately passed through the knee, the femoral end was secured, and various tensions were applied to the tibial end before fixation. Repeat knee arthrometer measurements were performed after each new tension was applied. Arthrometer testing was continued until the post-reconstruction 20 lb anterior drawer equalled the anterior cruciate ligament intact drawer. The patellar tendon returned the knee to its preoperative condition with a mean 3.6 lb of tension, the semitendinosus with 8.5 lb, and the iliotibial band with 13.6 lb. All these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01). The tension that needs to be applied to a graft during an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction appears to be tissue specific. It is hoped that precise intraoperative tensioning of anterior cruciate ligament grafts will lead to more reproducible anterior cruciate reconstruction results. © 1988, Arthroscopy Association of North America.

Postoperative immobilization was at either 30° (N = 17) or 70° (N = 12) of knee flexion for 6 weeks. All patients then followed a com mon preparatory training program for 8 weeks. In the 14th postoperative week the patients were put on either progressive resistance training (N = 12) or isokinetic training (N = 17) for 6 weeks, after which all had identical training. Independent of primary knee immobilization angle or training regimens, no differences could be demon strated with respect to stability, range of motion, func tion, or isokinetic mechanical output. For all patients, Lysholm knee function score improved from 60.5 to 93.6 (P < 0.001) and activity level from 3.9 to 6.3 (P < 0.001). Isokinetic peak torque, contractional work, and mean power of the quadriceps at 30, 90, and 180 deg/ sec were lower in the injured compared to the nonin jured leg (78% to 90%; P < 0.01) both preoperatively and at followup, and there were no significant differ ences between the preoperative and follow-up values. Clinical stability improved (P < 0.001) in 19 of the 29 patients (66%) and in 11 of those 17 patients with early isokinetic training (65%). Performance tests were nor mal in 23 of 29 patients (79%), with minor abnormalities in the rest. We conclude that immobilization at a higher tension of the quadriceps or early isokinetic training did not results in any advantages in the long run, and that patients with early isokinetic training did not show any increased incidence of remaining instability. © 1988, SAGE Publications.

Only two of the repairs were augmented with autogenous patellar tendon grafts. Five patients had complete knee dislocations, including tears of both cruciate ligaments. Nineteen patients had a concomitant extraarticular iliotibial band tenodesis. Twenty-seven knees (24 patients) were followed an average of 57.6 months postoperatively. Recreational skiing was resumed at 5.4 months on average, and in ski racing and pivot-requiring sports all but three patients resumed participation at an average of 9.1 months. In 78% of the knees there was pain-free function. Mild pain was reported in 19%, the majority of which (4/5) was related to vigorous activity. Of the total, only two knees were reported to have a sensation of giving way. On clinical examination 85% (23/27) had normal pivot shift examination with no evidence of abnormal motion. Four percent (1/27) had a 1+ test and 11% (3/27) had 'glides'. Arthrometer measurements revealed an average of 7.76 mm anterior displacement with 20 pounds of force on the knee with an ACL repair as compared to 5.56 mm on the uninjured knee. The laxity measurements of knees with repaired ACLs fell within the range reported for uninjured knees in the normal population. Five patients had reinjuries to the ACL at an average time of 28 months postoperatively, with two of five undergoing rerepair. Only one patient had an iliotibial band tenodesis to supplement the original ACL repair. With proper surgical technique and rehabilitation, ACL repair can be statistically and functionally successful in elite skiers. The use of the iliotibial band tenodesis is essential for successful ACL repair and the institution of immediate postoperative motion.","","anterior cruciate ligament; clinical article; human; knee ligament injury; skiing; sport injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03635465","","AJSMD","3674267","English","AM.

The lateral plasty contributed to its disappearance. A negative or only slightly positive Lachman test was obtained in 60%. The objective results were better when the menisci were intact.

Patellar crepitation was noted in 53%. It was due to abnormal stress set up in the retinacula fold by Lemaire's operation. Our current practice, therefore is to carry out lateral release of the patella before suturing the fascia lata. No re-operations have been necessary.","","anterior cruciate ligament; case study; follow up; human; injury; joint; joint laxity; knee; ligament; ligament surgery; major clinical study; patella tendon; tendon graft; therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","03914089","","IJSTD","","Italian","ITAL.

Fifty of our first 80 patients returned for re-evaluation with a minimum 2-year follow-up and with an average follow-up of 33 months. Functional stability, meaning no episodes of instability, was achieved in all 50 patients. Forty-four patients resumed sports requiring acceleration, deceleration, and cutting. Static stability testing revealed the pivot shift to be absent in 41 patients, trace in 8 patients, and mildly positive in 1 patient. From 1980 to the present, more than 300 intra-articular reconstructions have been performed utilizing a vascularized patellar tendon graft. Our overall results have not been evaluated as yet, but our clinical impression is that functional stability and static stability utilizing the pivot shift test were essentially unchanged from our previous study. However, there appears to be a definite improvement in the Lachman test. We have been utilizing the KT 1000 testing device to provide a more scientific objectivity of our results. Although there are probably several intra-articular techniques to achieve excellent static and functional results, we have been most satisfied with a laterally based vascularized patellar tendon graft and are not convinced that there is presently any nonbiologic substitute that can achieve significantly better results. Only time and more accurate scientific evaluating methodology will provide the answer.","","anterior cruciate ligament; human; injury; joint; ligament; ligament surgery; major clinical study; patella tendon; priority journal; therapy; Acute Disease; Arthroscopy; Chronic Disease; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Joint Instability; Knee Joint; Ligaments, Articular; Patella; Suture Techniques; Tendon Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00305898","","OCLNA","3889767","English","ORTHOP.

In a community of athletically motivated patients, a method of strong, durable stabilization is achieved using a pedicled patellar tendon graft with a 90° twist and bone-to-bone fixation. The intercondylar notch is surgically enlarged; holes are drilled from without into the tibia and femur; the graft is harvested with bone plugs at each end, pulled into place, and transfixed with screws. Knee function is tested before closure. After operation, the emphasis is on joint ranging exercises. Quadriceps exercises are not initiated until 3 months after operation. Participation in a sport is not advised for approximately one year. The patellar tendon graft has all of the advantages of an autologous tissue, either for augmentation or substitution of the ACL. It has strength, durability, and elasticity; it can be transplanted with bone plugs; with the infrapatellar fat pad preserved, it retains its paratendinous vascularity. The method has been employed for 5 years. No graft failures have occurred, and no patient has reinjured the reconstructed ligament. Not one patient has had to give up the sport that caused the injury due to recurrent instability.","","anterior cruciate ligament; clinical article; human; injury; joint; knee cruciate ligament; ligament; patella tendon; tendon graft; therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0009921X","","CORTB","6822009","English","CLIN.

The patients were divided into four groups according to the type of operation that had been carried out. In the first group an extra-articular lateral repair (""MacIntosh tenodesis"") had been performed, in the second group an intra-articular ""over-the-top"" repair using the quadriceps and the patellar tendon, in the third group a modified ""Eriksson"" procedure using the patellar tendon, and in the fourth group a combined intra- and extra-articular repair using carbon fibres as a graft. The results of the operations in the different groups are compared. The best results were obtained with the ""Eriksson"" procedure, closely followed by the ""over-the-top"" repair. Limited range of motion and retropatellar pain resulting from changes in the alignment of the patella were the main problems. The results after the use of carbon fibres were less good. In two cases the graft tore without further trauma, and there were also problems because of restricted range of motion and retropatellar pain. The worst results were found after extra-articular lateral repair, due to insufficient stability in many cases. However, the best results with regard to the range of motion were found in this group. © 1982 J. F.
