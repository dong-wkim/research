From 2006 to 2009, a total of 62 patients who underwent single-bundle ACL reconstruction with a quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the preserving-remnant group and the removing-remnant group. Plain radiographs were taken at 1 week, and 3, 6, and 24 months postoperatively, and tibial tunnel enlargement was evaluated. The postoperative clinical assessment included the Lysholm rating scale and KT-1000 measurement. In total, 27 patients in the preserving-remnant group and 24 patients in the removing-remnant group were followed up and the median follow-up was 24.5 months (range 24-27 months). Tibial tunnel enlargement occurred within 6 months postoperatively. Positive enlargement was observed in 8 patients (29.6 %) in the preserving-remnant group and 14 patients (58.3 %) in the removing-remnant group (P = 0.0388). The percentage of tibial tunnel enlargement was 25.7 +/- A 6.7 and 34.0 +/- A 8.9 % in the preserving- and removing-remnant groups, respectively (P = 0.0004). In the preserving-remnant group, the average Lysholm score increased from 60.3 +/- A 5.3 (51-69) to 93.0 +/- A 3.5 (88-100), and the side-to-side difference of the KT-1000 changed from 6.3 +/- A 0.9 (5.1-8.0) to 1.4 +/- A 0.6 (0.5-2.4) mm. In the removing-remnant group, the average Lysholm score increased from 58.7 +/- A 6.5 (48-71) to 91.1 +/- A 3.9 (85-100), and the side-to-side difference of the KT-1000 changed from 6.5 +/- A 0.8 (5.4-8.2) to 1.7 +/- A 0.6 (0.6-2.8) mm. It is confirmed that remnant preservation in ACL reconstruction can resist tibial tunnel enlargement but that this technique does not affect the short-term clinical outcome of ACL reconstruction.

Methods: Skeletally mature candidates younger than 24 years old with an ACL tear were randomized into either the AIST (n = 32) or BPTB (n = 32) group and were followed for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained at 1-year follow-up, and radiographs were obtained at 2-year follow-up. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using an anteromedial portal to establish the femoral tunnel. The primary outcome measure was KT-1000 stability testing. Secondary outcome measures included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Knee Evaluation Form, IKDC Subjective Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Marx Activity Scale, visual analog pain scale, and SF-12 (Mental and Physical). Results: At 2-year follow-up, no statistical difference existed with KT-1000-measured side-to-side laxity between AIST (0.3 +/- 0.7 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.0-1.0 mm) and BPTB (0.0 +/- 0.8 mm, confidence interval CI -0.3 to 1.1 mm) (P = .197). In addition, no statistical differences between the groups were found for IKDC Subjective Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Marx, SF-12 Mental, SF-12 Physical, or with regards to imaging findings. Patients with BPTB reported significantly greater postoperative pain scores at days 2 (P = .049), 3 (P = .004), and 7 (P = .015) and had significantly greater kneeling pain at 2 years (P < .019). A return to sport questionnaire at 2 years revealed no significant difference between the groups for returning to preoperative level of sport activity (83% AIST, 74% BPTB; P = .415). Two graft retears (7%; P = .222) occurred in the AIST group. Three patients in the BPTB group experienced ACL tears in the contralateral knee (9%; P = .239).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft with up to 2years follow-up, and compare the outcome with conventional ACL reconstruction and preoperative data.MethodsNinety patients who required anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction were randomized to undergo either the CaP-hybridized tendon graft method (CaP group, n=45) or the conventional method (conventional group, n=45). At 1 and 2years postoperatively, all patients were evaluated using KT-1000 arthrometry, pivot-shift test, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade, Lysholm scale, and Tegner scale; at the same timepoints, bone tunnel enlargement was evaluated using computed tomography, and the tendon graft intensity was evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging. Tendon graft appearance was evaluated arthroscopically once after a period of up to 2years postoperatively. Cases of re-rupture and adverse events were recorded in both groups.ResultsIn both groups, the KT-1000 arthrometry, pivot-shift test, IKDC grade, and Lysholm scale results at 1 and 2years postoperatively were superior to preoperative data; these results did not significantly differ between groups at either timepoint. The rate of increase of the cross-sectional area of the femoral bone tunnel in the CaP group was smaller than that in the conventional group at 1year postoperatively. The other results did not significantly differ between the two groups at any timepoint. There were two cases of re-rupture in the CaP group, and six cases of re-rupture in the conventional group. There were no adverse events during follow-up in either group.ConclusionsAnatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction using a CaP-hybridized tendon graft was safe, and resulted in improved clinical outcomes at 2years postoperatively compared with preoperative data; the outcomes were comparable with the conventional method.

A Prospective Randomized Study,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose: The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to compare knee stability, kneeling pain, harvest site pain, sensitivity loss, and subjective clinical outcome after primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with either bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or quadriceps tendon-bone (QTB) autografts in a noninferiority study design. Methods: From 2005 to 2009, a total of 51 patients were included in the present study. Inclusion criteria were isolated ACL injuries in adults. Twenty-five patients were randomized to BPTB grafts and 26 to QTB grafts. An independent examiner performed follow-up evaluations 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Anteroposterior knee laxity was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA). Anterior knee pain was assessed clinically and by knee-walking ability. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were used for patient-evaluated outcome. Results: Anterior knee laxity was equal between the 2 groups with KT-1000 values of 1.1 +/- 1.4 mm and 0.8 +/- 1.7 mm standard deviation (SD) at follow-up in QTB and BPTB groups, respectively (P.65), whereas positive pivot shift test results were seen less frequently (14% compared with 38%, respectively; P = .03). Anterior kneeling pain, evaluated by the knee walking ability test, was significantly less in the QTB group, with only 7% of patients grading knee walking as difficult or impossible compared with 34% in the BPTB group. At 1 and 2 years' follow-up, there was no difference between the 2 groups in subjective patient-evaluated outcome. The IKDC score was 75 +/- 13 patients and 76 +/- 16 SD at 1-year follow-up in QTB and BPTB groups, respectively (P = .78). At 2 years, 12 patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in 18 in the BPTB group and 21 in the QTB group. Conclusions: The use of the QTB graft results in less kneeling pain, graft site pain, and sensitivity loss than seen with BPTB grafts; however, similar anterior knee stability and subjective outcomes are seen. The results of this study show that QTB is a viable option for ACL reconstruction.

Methods: All 169 included patients (mean age 28.5 years, 65% male) were treated with anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction using patellar tendon autograft and were randomized to tibial fixation of the ACL graft at either 0 degrees (n = 85) or 30 degrees (n = 84). The primary outcome was the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 2 years after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the Marx Activity Scale (MAS), the rate of reoperation, and physical examination findings at 1 year, including KT-1000 and side-to-side differences in knee extension. Results: The follow-up rate was 82% (n = 139) for the primary outcome. Graft failure rate at 2 years was 1% (n = 2, 1 per group). ACL tibial graft fixation at 0 degrees or 30 degrees did not have a significant effect on KOOS scores at 2 years after ACLR. Patients whose graft was fixed at a knee flexion angle of 0 degrees had greater scores on the MAS (mean 9.6 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.5 to 10.6, versus 8.0, 95% CI 6.9 to 9.1; P = .04), and a greater proportion achieved the minimal clinical important difference (MCID) for the KOOS pain subdomain (94% versus 81%; P = .04). There was no significant difference in knee extension loss, KT-1000 measurements, or reoperation between the 2 groups. Conclusion: In the setting of anatomic single-bundle ACLR using patellar tendon autograft and anteromedial portal femoral drilling, there was no difference in KOOS scores between patients fixed at 0 degrees and 30 degrees.

Hypothesis: There is no difference in postoperative range of motion or stability after ACL reconstructions performed either acutely or delayed. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients with an acute ACL tear were prospectively randomized to either early ( within 21days) or delayed ( beyond 6 weeks) reconstruction using autograft hamstring tendon. Previous knee surgery on the index extremity and a multiligamentous injury were exclusionary criteria. Surgical technique and postoperative rehabilitation were identical for all patients. Postoperative assessments included range of motion and KT-1000 arthrometer measurements compared with the contralateral knee. Standardized outcome measures were used including single assessment numeric evaluation (SANE), Lysholm, and Tegner Activity Score. Results: Seventy consecutive patients were enrolled, and 1 patient was dropped after a postoperative infection. Sixty-nine patients ( 34 acute, 35 delayed) with an average age of 27 years composed the study cohort. The mean time from injury to surgery was 9 days ( range, 2-17 days) for patients in the early group and 85 days (range, 42-192) for those in the delayed group. The average follow-up from surgery was 366 days ( range, 185-869). Articular cartilage and meniscal injuries were comparable between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in degrees of extension or flexion lost relative to the nonoperative side, operative time, KT-1000 arthrometer differences, or subjective knee evaluations. Conclusion: Excellent clinical results can be achieved after ACL reconstructions performed soon after injury using autograft hamstrings. Although the authors do not advocate that all reconstructions should be performed acutely, they found that early ACL reconstructions do not result in loss of motion or suboptimal clinical results as long as a rehabilitation protocol emphasizing extension and early range of motion is employed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2008,36,4,,,,,656,662,,10.1177/0363546507312164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546507312164,,,,,,,,18212347,,,,,WOS:000254679500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies with 2-, 5- and 10-year follow-up are conflicted as to whether this technique is superior to the previous gold standard method of ACL reconstruction, the anatomic single-bundle (SB) reconstruction. Purpose/Hypothesis: The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the outcomes of the anatomic DB technique and anatomic SB technique with independent drilling at 10 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. We hypothesized that DB ACL reconstruction would result in a better outcome in terms of the pivot-shift test. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 105 patients (33 women, 72 men; median age, 27 years [range, 18-52 years]) were randomized and underwent ACL reconstruction (DB group: n = 53; SB group: n = 52). All reconstruction procedures were performed anatomically by identifying the ACL footprint, using the anteromedial portal for femoral tunnel drilling, and utilizing interference screws for tibial and femoral fixation. One blinded observer examined the patients both preoperatively and at follow-up (median, 120 months [range, 112-134 months]). Multiple subjective and objective clinical evaluations were used to assess the outcomes. Radiographic assessments of osteoarthritis were performed using the Ahlback, Kellgren-Lawrence, and Fairbank classification systems early postoperatively and at the final follow-up. Results: Preoperatively, no differences were found between the study groups. Overall, 70 patients (67%; DB group: n = 39; SB group: n = 31) were available for analysis at 10-year follow-up. No significant difference could be shown between the groups in terms of the pivot-shift grade, knee laxity measurements using the KT-1000 arthrometer, manual Lachman grade, single-leg hop test result, range of motion measurements, Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) score. Correspondingly, no differences were found between the groups regarding the presence of radiographic osteoarthritis at follow-up. Both groups improved at follow-up compared with preoperatively in terms of the pivot-shift grade, knee laxity measurements using the KT-1000 arthrometer, manual Lachman grade, Lysholm knee score, and KOOS score (P < .05 [highest P value for any comparison]). Conclusion: The anatomic DB technique was not superior to the anatomic SB technique with independent drilling at 10-year follow-up in regard to objective and subjective measurements.

Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: From June 1999 to March 2000, 64 patients were included in this prospective study. A single surgeon performed primary arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in an alternating sequence. In 32 patients, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed with hamstring tendon autograft (semitendinosus and gracilis [STG] group) while in the other 32 patients the reconstruction was performed with patellar tendon autograft (PT group). Results: At the 11-year follow-up, no statistically significant differences were seen with respect to the Lysholm score and Short Form-36, KT-1000 arthrometer laxity testing, anterior knee pain, single-legged hop test, or International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) classification results. Positive pivot-shift test (11) was significantly more frequent in the PT group (P = .036). Twenty-two patients (81%) in the STG group and 18 patients (72%) in the PT group were still at their preinjury level of activity. Graft rupture occurred in 2 patients from the STG group (6%) and in 4 patients from the PT (12%). Grade B and C abnormal radiographic findings were seen in 84% (21 of 25) of patients in the PT group and in 63% (17 of 27) of patients in the STG group (P = .008). Conclusion: Both hamstring and patellar tendon autografts provided good subjective outcomes and objective stability at 11 years. Positive pivot-shift test (11) was significantly more frequent in the PT group. No significant differences in the rate of graft failure were identified. Patients with patellar tendon graft had a greater prevalence of osteoarthritis at 11 years after surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2011,39,10,,,,,2161,2169,,10.1177/0363546511411702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546511411702,,,,,,,,21712483,,,,,WOS:000296287800021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: Seventy-eight patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with an autologous semitendinosus tendon were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: SB reconstruction (n = 39) and DB reconstruction (n = 39). In both groups, grafts were fixed at 30 degrees of flexion with a total tension of 80 N. The following evaluation methods were used: clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA) measurement, muscle strength, Tegner activity score, Lysholm score, subjective rating scale regarding patient satisfaction and sports performance level, graft retear, contralateral ACL tear, and additional meniscus surgery. Results: Fifty-three patients (25 in SB group and 28 in DB group) who were followed up for a minimum of 3 years (mean, 69 months; range, 36 to 140 months) were evaluated. Preoperatively, there were no differences between the groups. Postoperatively, the Lachman and pivot-shift test results were better in the DB group (P = .024 and P < .0001, respectively). KT measurements were better in the DB group (mean, 1.4 mm v 2.7 mm; P = .0023). The Tegner score was also better in the DB group (P = .033). There were no significant differences in range of motion, muscle strength, Lysholm score, subjective rating scale, graft retear, and secondary meniscal tear. Conclusions: In ACL reconstruction using the transtibial approach, DB reconstruction was significantly better than SB reconstruction regarding anterior and rotational stability during the 3- to 12-year follow-up. The results of KT measurements and the Lachman and pivot-shift tests were significantly better in the DB group, whereas there was no difference in the anterior drawer test results.

Hypothesis: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft would have a better clinical outcome and reduce the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement compared with a conventional method because of the enhanced anchoring between the tendon graft and the bone. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients (N = 64) with unilateral ACL rupture underwent arthroscopically assisted single-bundle ACL reconstruction using a 4-strand semitendinosus tendon or 4-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendons with EndoButton femoral fixation and screw washer tibial fixation. These patients were equally randomized to undergo the CaP (n = 32) or conventional (n = 32) method using a transtibial tunnel approach according to the closed envelope method. In the CaP group, the tendon graft was hybridized with the CaP at both ends of the graft. One surgeon performed all reconstructions without knowing which graft was prepared. Patients' backgrounds regarding age at surgery, gender, period before surgery, and associated meniscal injuries were similar in the 2 groups. All patients followed the same postoperative protocol. At 1 and 2 years after surgery, they were evaluated with the manual knee laxity test, KT-1000 arthrometry, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) examination form, Tegner scale, and Lysholm scale. Also, 1 year postoperatively, bone tunnel enlargement was analyzed using computed tomography, intensity of the tendon graft by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tendon graft appearance by arthroscopic examination. All the examinations were performed blindly. Results: All patients underwent a minimum 2-year follow-up. KT-1000 arthrometry data indicated statistically significant decreased average anterior tibial translation in the CaP group compared with the conventional method group: 1.0 +/- 2.0 mm versus 1.9 +/- 1.6 mm (P < .05), respectively, at 1 year; 1.6 +/- 2.1 mm versus 2.6 +/- 2.4 mm (P < .05), respectively, at 2 years. The Lysholm score was higher in the CaP group than in the conventional method group at 2 years (96.9 +/- 4.3 vs 91.7 +/- 13.3, P < .05). The CaP-hybridized tendon graft reduced the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement of the anteroposterior diameter at the main joint aperture site 1 year postoperatively (femoral side: 15.5% +/- 13.4% vs 22.1% +/- 16.4%, P < .05; tibial side: 19.3% +/- 17.1% vs 26.1% +/- 13.7%, P < .05). The results of the pivot-shift test, IKDC grade, and Tegner score; the intensity of the tendon graft (MRI); and arthroscopic appearance were not significantly different at both follow-up periods in the 2 groups. Conclusion: The CaP-hybridized tendon graft improved anterior knee stability and Lysholm scores at the 2-year follow-up and improved anterior knee stability and reduced the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement in both tunnels at the 1-year follow-up compared with the conventional method for single-bundle ACL reconstruction.

This difference may be due to graft slippage in less dense female tibial bone. Hypothesis: Reinforcement of tibial fixation of the hamstring tendon graft in women by supplementary methods may reduce laxity. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Fifty-six female patients divided into 2 groups (standard tibial fixation with 7 x 25-mm metal interference screw versus metal interference screw with supplementary staple fixation) were followed for 2 years. Results: After 2 years, the mean side-to-side difference using KT-1000 arthrometer manual maximum measurements was 1.8 mm (standard group) and 1.1 mm (staple group) (P = .05). The percentage of patients with a side-to-side difference of < 3 mm did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P = .66): 88.8% of the standard group versus 90.5% of the staple group.

Methods: Sixty-two male adult patients undergoing primary ACLR were prospectively parallel randomized to bone-patellar tendon-bone graft (BPTB), single-bundle (HT-SB) or double-bundle (HT-DB) hamstring graft. BMD (primary outcome) at the proximal tibia, distal femur, femoral neck and trochanteric region was measured blindly at day 1, 3 months, 5 months and 1 year after surgery. KT-1000, Lysholm, IKDC, one-leg hop test and Lachman test were performed blindly at baseline and 1 year post-reconstruction. Results: There was a significant bone loss at the injured knee and hip at 3 and 5 months which was reversible at the knee, but not at the hip, at 1 year post-operation. There was a significant improvement of early clinical and functional outcomes at 1 year. No significant differences in bone loss was detected among different surgical techniques, except BMD loss at the femoral neck, though a trend of greater BMD loss in the HT-SB group at 5 months after reconstruction was observed. There was a significant positive correlation between BMD at the distal femur and the single-leg hop distance at 1 year. Conclusion: In conclusion, the three surgical techniques were similar in transient bone loss at the knee region, irreversible bone loss at the hip, early clinical and functional outcomes up to 1 year post-reconstruction. BMD at the distal femur was positively associated with the single-leg hop distance at 1 year post-reconstruction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Between these two grafts might be differences in stability, morbidity, or long-term changes. This study investigates outcomes of ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon versus semitendinosus tendon autografts. We hypothesize no significant differences in clinical outcome and knee stability between both groups. In a randomized prospective trial, we operated 62 ACL-deficient patients, 45 males and 17 females with a mean age of 29.8 years (min. 18, max. 44). We reconstructed the ligament using either autologous patellar tendon (n = 31) or semitendinosus tendon (n = 31). After 10 years of follow-up, we investigated 47 patients of the study. For evaluation we used a standard clinical examination including one-leg jump test and KT-1000 instrumental translation measure, visual analog pain scale, IKDC subjective knee form, Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and standard X-rays of the knee. The data did not show any significant differences between the two groups. Between 5 and 10 years after ACL reconstruction both groups started to develop degenerative arthritic changes, which were detectable in standard radiographs of the knee. At 10-year follow-up mean IKDC for the BPTB group was 1.8 (min. 1, max. 3) and for the ST group it was 2.2 (min 1, max. 4), p = 0.35. Regarding Tegner activity scale after 10 years, the BPTB group showed a mean score of 5.9 (min. 4, max. 9) versus 5.1 (min. 3, max. 7) in the ST group, p = 0.53. For the Lysholm score the BPTB group reached a mean of 92.0 (min. 63, max. 98) and the ST group 91.8 (min. 62, max. 98) points, p = 0.66. There is a tendency for higher donor site morbidity in the BPTB group than in the ST group, p = 0.07. Both, patellar tendon and semitendinosus tendon are safe autografts for ACL reconstruction. Regarding graft selection, individual patient-dependent factors should be considered.

Purpose: This study aimed to compare the outcomes of isolated ACL reconstruction using the patellar tendon (PT) autograft and the hamstring (HT) autograft in 180 patients over 20 years. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 180 participants undergoing isolated ACL reconstruction between 1993 and 1994 were prospectively recruited. Evaluation was performed at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years after surgery and included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee ligament evaluation with radiographic evaluation, KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference, and subjective scores. Results: Over 20 years, there were 16 patients (18%) and 9 patients (10%) with an ACL graft rupture in the HT and PT groups, respectively (P = .13). ACL graft rupture was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; P = .007), nonideal tunnel position (OR, 3.6; P = .019), and age <18 years at the time of surgery (OR, 4.6; P = .003). The odds of a contralateral ACL rupture were increased in patients with the PT graft compared with patients with the HT graft (OR, 2.2; P = .02) and those aged <18 years at the time of surgery (OR, 3.4; P = .001). The mean IKDC scores at 20-year follow-up were 86 and 89 for the PT and HT groups, respectively (P = .18).

Limited evidence is available regarding the most effective intervention to achieve symmetry after reconstruction with contralateral bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft. Purpose: To verify whether unilateral isotonic resistance exercise is more effective than bilateral exercise for obtaining postoperative functional and muscular strength symmetry between the donor limb and reconstructed limb for patients who received BPTB graft. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 88 patients were randomly divided into a control group (n = 44) and an intervention group (n = 44). All participants performed an 8-week exercise program starting at the beginning of the fourth postoperative month and were evaluated before and after the program. The control group performed bilateral exercises, and the intervention group performed unilateral exercises for the donor limb only (the limb with the greatest disability). The primary outcome was muscle strength (peak torque and hamstrings to quadriceps [H:Q] ratio), and the secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM; goniometry), KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference in anteroposterior knee laxity, and objective (single-leg hop test) and subjective (Lysholm score) functionality. Results: Both groups improved significantly from before to after the exercise program. The improvements were significantly greater in the intervention group regarding peak torque, H:Q ratio, flexion ROM, single-leg hop test, and Lysholm score in the donor limb (P < .001 for all), and the improvements were significantly greater in the control group regarding peak torque and single-leg hop test in the reconstructed limb (P < .001 for both). Comparison between the groups showed significantly increased symmetry regarding peak torque, H:Q ratio, and single-leg hop test in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .001), with large effect sizes (>0.80) except for the H:Q ratio.

Retaining the insertion may help to preserve vascularity and viability of the graft and bypass the stages of avascular necrosis and revascularization, which might be beneficial to graft maturity. Purpose: To investigate and compare graft maturity by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after ACL reconstruction with preservation or detachment of hamstring tendon tibial insertion at up to 2 years. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Forty-five patients (age range, 18-45 years) undergoing isolated ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon were enrolled and randomized to 2 groups. The tibial insertion of the hamstring tendon was preserved in the study group (n = 21) and detached in the control group (n = 24). Patients had follow-up at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, which consisted of the following: (1) clinical examination and (2) MRI evaluation of graft signal intensity based on signal/noise quotient (SNQ) values. Finally, 18 patients in the study group and 19 in the control group received full follow-up evaluation (ie, at all 4 time points). Results: All knees acquired full range of motion at 24 months without significant laxity. At each time point, the KT-1000 arthrometer revealed no significant difference between groups; the clinical scores significantly improved in both groups, although the difference between groups was not significant. In the control group, the SNQ value increased from 3 months, peaked at 6 months, and then decreased (3 months, 21.4 +/- 12.7; 6 months, 25.6 +/- 12; 12 months, 18.3 +/- 7.7; 24 months, 15.3 +/- 6.3).

Purpose: To compare the outcomes, especially the long-term cumulative failure rate, of ACL reconstruction using either synthetics with remnant preservation or hamstring autografts (4-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendons). Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 133 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction (synthetics: n = 43; hamstring autografts: n = 90) between July 2004 and December 2007 were included. Questionnaires (Tegner activity scale, Lysholm knee scale, and International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] subjective form) were completed preoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years postoperatively. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was additionally applied at 10 years' follow-up. The physical examination was based on the 2000 IKDC form. The manual maximum side-to-side difference (KT-1000 arthrometer), single-hop test, thigh muscle atrophy, and joint degeneration (Kellgren and Lawrence classification) were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test (Mantel-Cox, 95% CI) were used to compare graft survivorship. Results: Ten years postoperatively, 111 patients were available, with 38 (88.4%) patients (mean age, 27.6 9.3 years; 28 men) with synthetics and 73 (81.1%) patients (mean age, 28.6 +/- 8.8 years; 64 men) with hamstring autografts. Among them, 104 patients (synthetics: n = 35 [81.4%]; hamstring autografts: n = 69 [76.7%]) completed subjective evaluations, and 89 patients (synthetics: n = 30 [69.8%]; hamstring autografts: n = 59 [65.6%]) completed objective evaluations. For hamstring autografts and synthetics, the cumulative failure rates were 8.2% and 7.9%, respectively, and the log-rank test demonstrated no significant difference between the 2 Kaplan-Meier survival curves (P = .910). At 6 months postoperatively, for hamstring autografts and synthetics, the mean Lysholm score was 83.0 +/- 7.8 and 88.1 +/- 7.5, respectively (P < .001); the mean IKDC score was 83.8 +/- 7.8 and 86.9 +/- 4.5, respectively (P = .036); and the mean Tegner score was 3.7 +/- 1.1 and 5.0 +/- 1.5, respectively (P < .001). At 1 year postoperatively, the mean Tegner score was 5.5 +/- 1.9 and 6.5 +/- 2.0, respectively (P = .011). No statistically significant difference was observed on other subjective evaluation findings, physical examination findings (overall IKDC grade A: 45.8% of hamstring autografts, 50.0% of synthetics), side-to-side difference (1.5 +/- 1.5 mm for synthetics, 2.4 +/- 2.1 mm for hamstring autografts), single-hop test findings (grade A: 84.7% of hamstring autografts, 93.3% of synthetics), grade A/B thigh muscle atrophy (88.1% of hamstring autografts, 93.3% of synthetics), ipsilateral radiographic osteoarthritis (55.9% of hamstring autografts, 50.0% of synthetics), and graft survivorship. Conclusion: In this prospective cohort study, primary ACL reconstruction using either synthetics with remnant preservation or hamstring autografts showed satisfactory outcomes, especially the long-term cumulative failure rate, at 10 years postoperatively.

Purpose/Hypotheses: The study objectives were to compare clinical, functional, patient-reported, and OA imaging outcomes between 2 different initial laxity-based graft tension cohorts and a matched uninjured control group as well as to evaluate the effects of laxity-based graft tension on OA development at 84-month follow-up. The 2 laxity-based tension protocols were (1) to restore normal anteroposterior (AP) laxity at the time of surgery relative to the contralateral uninjured knee (low-tension group) or (2) to overconstrain AP laxity by 2 mm relative to the contralateral uninjured knee (high-tension group). The hypotheses were that (1) the high-tension group would have improved outcomes and decreased OA compared with the low-tension group after 84 months, and (2) the outcomes for the high-tension group would be equivalent to those for an age-, sex-, race-, and activity-matched group of control participants with uninjured knees. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients had their ACLs reconstructed with either a bone-patellar tendon-bone or 4-stranded hamstring autograft, and outcomes were compared with a matched control group. Outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at 60 and 84 months postoperatively and included clinical (KT-1000 arthrometer AP laxity measurement and International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] examination score), functional (1-legged hop for distance and knee extensor torque), patient-reported (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], Short Form-36 [SF-36], and patient satisfaction survey), and OA imaging (measurement of joint space width [JSW], Osteoarthritis Research Society International [OARSI] radiographic score, and Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score [WORMS]) components. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to evaluate differences in outcomes between the treatment groups and the control group. Results: There were significant differences between the 2 tension groups in 1 of 5 KOOS subscales (sports and recreation; P = .04) and 2 of 8 SF-36 subscales (vitality, mental health; P < .04) at 84 and 60 months, respectively. Both tension groups scored significantly worse than the control group in the IKDC examination (P < .001), 1-legged hop (P .017), KOOS quality of life and symptoms subscales (P < .03), and OARSI radiographic score (P .02) at 84 months. The low-tension group performed significantly worse than the control group on the KOOS pain subscale (P = .03), SF-36 general health and social functioning (P < .04), OARSI radiographic score (P < .001), and WORMS (P = .001), while the high-tension group had statistically different results than the control group in AP knee laxity (P < .001), radiographic JSW (P = .003), and OARSI radiographic score (P = .02) as well as significantly more subsequent knee injuries (P = .02) at 84 months. Conclusion: The results do not support the hypotheses that the high-tension group would have improved outcomes when compared with the low-tension group after 84 months of healing or that the outcomes for the high-tension group would be equivalent to those for the matched control group. While there were minor differences in patient-reported outcomes between the 2 laxity-based tension groups, all other outcomes were similar.

Methods: A total of 56 participants were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and placed into two groups: HT or QT. The hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio was the primary end-point measured with a Genu-3 dynamometer. Peak torque, functional assessment (Lysholm knee scoring scale and Cincinnati Knee Rating System), and anteroposterior laxity (KT-20001m arthrometer) were also assessed. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: The results of the H/Q ratio analysis of the participants over time revealed significant differences at 60, 180, and 300 degrees/s at three, six, and 12 months of follow-up (60 degrees/s: F = 5.3, p = 0.005; 180 degrees/s: F = 5.5, p = 0.004; 300 degrees/s: F = 5.1, p = 0.005). Furthermore, they revealed significant differences at 60 degrees/s, 180 degrees/s, and 300 degrees/s in the participants over time for peak torque in the extensor muscle strength at three and six months of follow-up, with higher values in the hamstring tendon group but not at 12 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences in functional endpoints or arthrometer assessments at 24 months of follow-up. Conclusion: An ACLR with a QT graft showed similar functional results with a better isokinetic H/Q ratio compared to an ACLR with the HT at 12 months of follow-up in soccer players. This higher H/Q ratio observed with the QT could be an advantage of this graft over the HT for an ACLR. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose:To evaluate the timing and rate of return for knee range of motion (ROM), stability, strength, and subjective scores after ACL reconstruction with contralateral patellar tendon graft (PTG). Study Design:Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods:Included were 2148 patients (1238 male patients, 910 female patients) who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with a contralateral PTG between 1995 and 2017 and had complete objective data through 3 months of follow-up. All patients participated in a rehabilitation program specific to goals for each knee. Patients were evaluated objectively with goniometric measurement of ROM, isokinetic quadriceps strength testing, and laxity with a KT-2000 arthrometer. Subjective data were collected at 2 and 5 years. Results:Normal extension on the reconstructed knee was attained for 95% of patients at 1 week postoperatively; normal flexion on the reconstructed knee was reached by 77% of patients by 3 months. At 3 months postoperatively, mean limb symmetry index strength was 104%, and the strength on the ACL-reconstructed and graft-donor knees was 87% and 86% of their respective preoperative strength.

Methods: Patients (n = 110 per group; 183 male; 14 to 50 years of age) were randomly allocated to anatomically positioned ACL reconstruction with use of a patellar tendon graft (patellar tendon group; mean age, 28.7 years), quadruple-stranded hamstring tendon construct (hamstring tendon group; mean age, 28.5 years), or double-bundle hamstring tendon construct (double-bundle group; mean age, 28.3 years). Computer-generated allocation with varied block randomization was performed intraoperatively. The 5-year primary outcome measure was the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Quality of Life (ACL-QOL) score, and secondary outcome measures included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score and objective grades, pivot shift assessment, range of motion, kneeling pain, Tegner activity scale, Cincinnati Occupational Rating Scale, complete traumatic reruptures, partial traumatic tears, total traumatic reinjuries, and atraumatic graft failures. Results: Three hundred and fifteen patients (95%) completed the 5-year follow-up (4 withdrawals, and 11 lost to followup). ACL-QOL scores increased significantly from baseline for all groups (p < 0.0001), but mean scores at 5 years did not differ among the groups (p = 0.548): mean (and standard deviation) of 82.5 +/- 17.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.0 to 86.0) for patellar tendon, 83.9 +/- 18.2 (95% CI, 80.3 to 87.4) for hamstring tendon, and 81.1 +/- 19.3 (95% CI, 77.4 to 84.8) for double-bundle. The proportions of patients at 5 years with a pivot shift grade of >= 2 (12% for patellar tendon, 16% for hamstring tendon, and 22% for double-bundle; p = 0.149) and with normal and nearly normal knees per IKDC grade (87%, 82%, and 75% for the 3 groups, respectively; p = 0.093) trended in favor of patellar tendon reconstruction. No differences were seen for the IKDC subjective scores, knee range of motion including passive extension deficits, the single leg hop test, Cincinnati Occupational Rating scores, and Tegner activity levels. Kneeling pain was more common with patellar tendon reconstruction (10% of patients compared with 4% for hamstring tendon and 2% for double-bundle; p = 0.029). For hamstring tendon and double-bundle reconstructions, there were trends toward more complete traumatic reruptures (4% for patellar tendon, 10% for hamstring tendon, and 10% for double-bundle; p = 0.145) and partial traumatic tears (0%, 5%, and 6%, respectively; p = 0.059), with significantly fewer combined traumatic reinjuries in the patellar tendon group (4 patients compared with 16 for hamstring tendon and 17 for double-bundle; p = 0.010). Atraumatic graft failure (pivot shift grade of >= 2) was found for 10% of the patients. Conclusions: At 5 years, we found no significant difference in the quality-of-life outcome among the patellar tendon, hamstring tendon, and double-bundle techniques for ACL reconstruction. Significantly more patients in the hamstring tendon and double-bundle groups experienced traumatic graft reinjury compared with the patellar tendon group.

However, concern exists regarding the potential for lengthening under cyclical loads. Purpose: To compare the residual anterior laxity of 2 methods of femoral fixation, ALSF versus interference screw fixation, in patients undergoing isolated ACLR in the absence of meniscal injuries. To determine the preoperative risk factors associated with residual postoperative anterior laxity. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed comparing 2 groups of patients that underwent primary ACLR using ALSF versus bioabsorbable interference screw fixation. Anterior knee laxity was assessed with Telos stress radiography, while functional outcomes were evaluated with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Tegner activity level scale at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with residual postoperative laxity >3 mm. Results: Of the 1136 patients who underwent ACLR during the study period, 363 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 272 patients (75%) (mean age, 31.7 +/- 10.7 years) with a mean follow-up of 25.7 +/- 4.6 months (range, 24-36 months) consented to participate (screw group: n = 121; ALSF group: n = 151). The 2 groups were statistically comparable in terms of age, sex ratio, time from injury to surgery, graft diameter, preoperative laxity, preoperative objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade, and preoperative Tegner score. The mean postoperative laxity as a continuous variable was significantly different comparing the ALSF and screw groups (1.49 +/- 1.98 mm and 2.32 +/- 1.97 mm, respectively; P < .001). In the screw group, 76 patients (62.8%) had normal (<3 mm), 40 (33.1%) had nearly normal (3-6 mm), and 5 (4.1%) had abnormal (>= 6 mm) postoperative knee laxity according to the IKDC grade, while in the ALSF group, 112 patients (74.2%) had normal, 37 (24.5%) had nearly normal, and 2 (1.3%) had abnormal laxity (P = .0833). No significant difference was found in KOOS or Tegner scores comparing the 2 femoral fixation methods: KOOS, 90.6 +/- 7.5 (ALSF group) and 90.6 +/- 7.4 (screw group) (P = .7631), versus Tegner, 6.5 +/- 1.3 (ALSF group) and 6.3 +/- 1.4 (screw group) (P = .2992). A negative correlation was found between postoperative laxity and final Tegner (r(s) = -0.303, P < .001) and KOOS scores (r(s) = -0.168, P = .005). The initial univariate analysis showed differences between groups of patients with residual knee laxity >= 3 mm and <3 mm on preoperative pivot shift, preoperative laxity, age, fixation type, and preoperative objective IKDC grade. The multivariate analysis on these factors showed that the pivot shift remained the only significant predictor for residual laxity >= 3 mm for pivot shift grade 2 compared with grade 1 (odds ratio, 4.689 [95% CI, 2.465-9.286]) and for pivot shift grade 3 compared with grade 1 (odds ratio, 58.025 [95% CI, 12.757-557.741]) (P < .001). Conclusion: For primary ACLR, the use of an ALSF device for femoral fixation is associated with noninferior postoperative anterior knee laxity results compared with interference screw fixation at a minimum 2 years' follow-up.

Purpose: To determine if modified iliotibial band tenodesis (MITBT) can improve clinical outcomes and reduce the recurrence of ACL ruptures when added to ACL reconstruction in patients with a residual pivot shift. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Patients with a primary ACL rupture satisfying the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: first ACL rupture, involved in pivoting sports, skeletally mature, no meniscal repair performed, and residual pivot shift relative to the contralateral uninjured knee immediately after ACL reconstruction. Patients were randomized to group A (no further surgery) or group B (MITBT added) and were followed up for 2 years. The patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures used were the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscale of sport/recreation (Sport/Rec), KOOS subscale of quality of life (QoL), Lysholm knee score (LKS), Tegner activity scale (TAS), recurrent ACL ruptures, or need for further surgery in either knee. Analysis of variance was used to compare PROs; the Wilcoxon test was used for the TAS; and the chi-square test was used for recurrence of ACL ruptures, meniscal injuries, and contralateral ACL ruptures (P < .05). Results: A total of 55 patients were randomized: 27 to group A (female:male ratio = 15:12; mean age, 22.3 +/- 3.7 years) and 28 to group B (female:male ratio = 17:11; mean age, 21.8 +/- 4.1 years).

For the external compartment BPTB + L (8.2 mm) showed superiority over DBH (5.6 mm) and BPTB (4.1 mm) (ANOVA, p = 0.0001, Tukey's test). Kneeling was better in the DBH group (ANOVA, p = 0.0001, Tukey's test). In 22 patients it felt normal, while only in seven in the BPTB and eight in the BPTB + L groups. Sensory deficits were present in 11 patients from the DBH group, while in 17 in the BPTB and 19 in the BPTB + L groups (ANOVA, p = 0.052). Mean IKDC values, presence of anterior knee pain, subsequent operations, ability to squat and return to sports were not statistically different between groups. Absolute correction of ATT was not statistically different for the medial compartment, but the patellar tendon reconstruction combined with the extra-articular procedure achieved the best lateral compartment ATT correction.

There was a 2-year minimum follow-up. From January to December 2009, an ACL 4-tunnel, anatomic, double-bundle reconstruction was performed on 27 patients. Double-strand hamstring tendon grafts were used in each femoral tunnel as well as two interference screws. Tibial fixation was insured through manual tension, by tying non-absorbable sutures on the bone bridge between the two tunnels at 20A degrees of knee flexion. Clinical assessments included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm knee scores, range of motion (ROM), pivot-shift test, single-leg hop, and quadriceps-hamstrings strength tests using a hand-held dynamometer. Anterior knee laxity was also assessed using a rolimeter. A single examiner performed all testing pre-operatively at 6 months and during the 2-year follow-up. All patients were assessed during the 2-year follow-up. At that time, 92 % of the patients presented normal anterior laxity (average, 1.3 +/- 0.5 mm) and rotational knee stability. No statistical side-to-side difference was found for ROM, muscle strength, single-leg hop, and function (n.s.). All patients presented a normal knee function according to the IKDC and the Lysholm score. In addition, no infection, graft failure, or pain were observed at the harvesting site. The study shows that satisfactory results in relation to knee laxity, function, and strength can be achieved with the implant-free tibial fixation in the ACL double-bundle reconstruction with two interference screws.

Purpose: To compare 25-year follow-up results after ACL reconstruction using a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft with or without the Kennedy LAD. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: One hundred patients undergoing ACL reconstruction between 1991 and 1993 were randomized into 2 groups: reconstruction using a BPTB graft alone (BPTB group, 51 patients) or a BPTB graft with the Kennedy LAD (LAD group, 49 patients). The 25-year follow-up evaluation included a clinical knee examination, patient-reported outcome measures, and an assessment of radiological osteoarthritis (OA) according to the Ahlback classification. Additional outcomes were reruptures and knee arthroplasty. Results: Ninety-three patients (93%) were available for the follow-up evaluation: 48 patients in the BPTB group and 45 in the LAD group. Through telephone calls, 26 patients were excluded from further investigation because of reruptures and arthroplasty in the knee of interest; 67 patients were further investigated.

Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Between August 2000 and May 2003, 64 Keller Army Hospital patients with complete anterior cruciate ligament tears were randomized to hamstring (n = 32) or patellar tendon (n = 32) autograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Operative graft fixation and rehabilitative techniques were the same for both groups. Follow-up assessments included the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score.

However, no existing clinical studies show adequate support for the choice of one graft over the other. Hypothesis: Hamstring tendons are equally as good as patellar tendon in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. Study Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial. Methods: Ninety-nine patients with laxity caused by a torn anterior cruciate ligament underwent arthroscopically assisted reconstruction with graft randomization according to their birth year. Grafts were either bone-patellar tendon-bone with metal interference screw fixation or double-looped hamstring tendons with metal plate fixation. There were no significant differences between the two groups preoperatively or at operation. Standard rehabilitation included immediate postoperative mobilization without a knee brace, protected weightbearing for 2 weeks, and return to full activity at 6 to 12 months.

Methods: Twenty-five patients who tore their anterior cruciate ligament were enrolled and underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were randomized to accelerated rehabilitation or nonaccelerated rehabilitation.

Results: At the 2-year follow-up, there was no difference in the increase of anterior knee laxity relative to the baseline values that were obtained immediately after surgery between the 2 groups (2.2-mm vs 1.8-mm increase relative to the normal knee). The groups were similar in terms of clinical assessment, patient satisfaction, activity level, function, and response of the biomarkers. After 1 year of healing, synthesis of collagen and turnover of aggrecan remained elevated in both groups. Conclusion: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft followed by either accelerated or nonaccelerated rehabilitation produces the same increase of anterior knee laxity.

In cases involving complete tears, ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgery is the only way to restore the ligament's integrity. When selecting a graft, both the potential complications and the mechanical properties and healing efficacies should be considered. Artificial ligaments have been widely applied in clinical ACLR, and most have exhibited satisfactory biocompatibility and short-term follow-up results. Compared with autografts and allografts, however, the lack of bioactivity of currently available artificial ligaments is a major disadvantage. In addition, some long-term follow-up results have revealed other drawbacks of artificial ligaments, such as graft failure and other complications. Here, we summarize attempts to enhance the bioactive performance of artificial ligaments, as such modifications may have good potential for clinical translation and could improve the long-term outcomes of existing products.

Hypothesis: The choice of graft material (patellar tendon or hamstring tendon) does affect clinical outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Prospective, nontrandomized clinical trial. Methods: Two groups of 90 patients each were followed for a minimum of 5 years. Results: International Knee Documentation Committee assessment revealed that more than 85% of each group had an overall score of A or B at all follow-up intervals. The median Lysholm knee score was greater than 90 for both groups at 2 and 5 years. Instrumented testing revealed no significant difference between the two groups beyond 3 years. Thirty-one percent of the patellar tendon group (25) had a fixed flexion deformity and 19% of the hamstring tendon group (14) had fixed flexion deformity at 5 years. Radiologic assessment revealed early osteoarthritic changes in 4% of the hamstring tendon group (2) and in 18% of the patellar tendon group (11) at 5 years. Conclusions: Arthroscopic reconstruction with either graft results in a similar surgical outcome, reliably restoring knee stability over a 5-year period; however, patients with patellar tendon grafts are at greater risk of developing early signs of osteoarthritis.

Treatment for acute anterior cruciate ligament tear: five year outcome of randomised trial. BMJ. 2013;346:F232. Clinical Question: Does early anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with rehabilitation lead to better patientreported outcomes and a lower incidence of osteoarthritis at 5 years postinjury compared with delayed ACL reconstruction with rehabilitation? Study Selection: This randomized controlled trial with extended follow-up at 5 years postrandomization was conducted in 2 Swedish orthopaedic departments. Data Extraction: The authors studied a total of 121 moderately active adults (age = 18-35 years) with an acute ACL rupture in a knee with no other history of trauma. Excluded were patients with a collateral ligament rupture, full-thickness cartilage defect, or extensive meniscal fixation. One patient assigned to the early ACL-reconstruction group did not attend the 5-year follow-up visit. Patients were randomly assigned to (1) an early ACL reconstruction plus structured rehabilitation group (n = 62, surgery within 10 weeks of injury) or (2) optionaldelayed ACL reconstruction plus structured rehabilitation group (n = 59). The primary outcome measure was change in the average of 4 out of 5 subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The authors also assessed crude KOOS (combined 4 subscales), KOOS subscale scores, general physical and mental health (Short-Form 36), activity level (Tegner Activity Scale), mechanical knee stability (Lachman and pivot shift tests), meniscal surgery status, and presence of knee osteoarthritis on radiographs. Main Results: Among patients randomized to the optionaldelayed ACL-reconstruction group, 30 (51%) opted for an ACL reconstruction. The treatment groups had comparable 5-year patient-reported outcomes and changes in patient-reported outcomes (eg, knee pain, knee symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreational levels, knee-related quality of life, general physical health, and general mental health). Patients in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group had greater mechanical knee instability than patients who received early ACL reconstruction; however, this was primarily among the patients opting for conservative management alone. In the overall sample, 61 knees (51%) required meniscal surgery over 5 years, regardless of treatment group. At 5 years, radiographs were available for 113 patients (93%). Overall, 29 patients (26%) had knee osteoarthritis at 5 years. Specifically, 13 patients (12%) developed tibiofemoral radiographic osteoarthritis (9 patients [16%] in the early ACL-reconstruction group, 4 [7%] in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group) and 22 (19%) developed patellofemoral osteoarthritis (14 patients [24%] in the early ACL-reconstruction group, 8 [15%] in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group). Patients with patellar tendon grafts (n = 40) had a greater incidence of ipsilateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis than patients with hamstrings tendon grafts (n = 51), but the 2 groups had similar incidences of ipsilateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. Six knees (5%) had both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Conclusions: Early ACL reconstruction plus rehabilitation did not provide better results at 5 years compared with optionaldelayed ACL reconstruction plus rehabilitation. Furthermore, the authors found no radiographic differences among patients with early ACL reconstruction, delayed ACL reconstruction, or no ACL reconstruction (rehabilitation alone).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2015,50,1,,,,,110,112,,10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.53,http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.53,,,,,,,,25322347,,,,,WOS:000352270300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Graft choice has shown to have an influence on postoperative outcomes after ACL-R. While patient reported outcomes measurements do not differ between graft options, evidence shows that normal knee kinematics is not fully restored after ACL-R with an increase in postoperative anterior tibial translation (ATT). Postoperative graft rupture rates seem to favor bone-patella-tendon-bone (BPTB) and quadriceps tendon (QT) autografts over HT or allografts. While return to sports rates seem comparable between different graft types, postoperative extensor strength is reduced in patients with BPTB and QT whereas flexion strength is weakened in patients with HT. Postoperative donor site morbidity is highest in BPTB but comparable between HT and QT.

A randomized controlled trial,KNEE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the peak extensor torque (primary outcome), sensory-motor capacity and Lysholm questionnaire score up to the fourth postoperative month post-primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with bone-patel lar-tendon-bone (BPTB) graft using either ipsilateral or contralateral technique in young sportsmen. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial from 2018 to 2019. The same preoperative protocol, surgical technique and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. Eighty-eight young adult male patients were randomized, and 44 of each group completed the trial. Results: After the follow up analysis, the contralateral receptor and donor limb demonstrated a statistically significant increase in peak extension torque compared with the ipsilateral operated limb (effect size (ES) = 0.99, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001; ES = 0.46, power = 0.56, P < 0.04). The symmetry between limbs was compared between groups. In the contralateral group, there was a significant decrease in the recipient limb (after surgery), compared with the donor limb (before surgery) (ES = 0.87, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001). In the ipsilateral group, the operated limb demonstrated a significant decrease in peak extension torque compared with the non-operated limb after surgery (ES = 1.88, power = 0.99, P < 0.0001). The comparison between groups in sensory-motor capacity and Lysholm score demonstrated a non-significant group effect postoperatively. Conclusion: The use of contralateral BPTB is more effective in increasing peak extension torque when compared with ipsilateral technique in young sportsmen. Furthermore, patients achieved greater symmetry (side to side) in quadriceps muscle performance after the 4-month follow up with a contralateral graft. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose/Hypothesis: To report the prevalence of OA after ACL reconstruction and to compare the OA prevalence between quadrupled semitendinosus tendon (ST) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts. The hypothesis was that there would be no difference in OA prevalence between the graft types. The secondary aim was to study whether patient characteristics and additional injuries were associated with long-term outcomes. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Radiological examination results, Tegner activity levels, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) values were determined in 135 (82%) of 164 patients at a mean of 14 years after ACL reconstruction randomized to an ST or a BPTB graft. Osteoarthritis was defined according to a consensus by at least 2 of 3 radiologists of Kellgren-Lawrence grade >= 2. Using regression analysis, graft type, sex, age, overweight, time between injury and reconstruction, additional meniscus injury, and a number of other variables were assessed as risk factors for OA 14 years after ACL reconstruction. Results: Osteoarthritis of the medial compartment was most frequent, with 57% of OA cases in the ACL-reconstructed knee and 18% of OA cases in the contralateral knee (P < .001). There was no difference between the graft types: 49% of OA of the medial compartment for BPTB grafts and 65% for ST grafts (P = .073). The KOOS results were lower for patients with OA in all subscales, indicating that OA was symptomatic. No difference in the KOOS between the graft types was found.

Purpose: To evaluate if ACLR using a hamstring tendon autograft results in better patient quality of life if the graft is harvested from the leg contralateral to the ACL rupture compared with the ipsilateral leg. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 100 participants between 16 and 50 years of age with a complete ACL tear were randomly assigned to undergo ACLR using either the ipsilateral or contralateral leg as the STG graft donor. Primary outcome measures were the ACL Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QOL), concentric knee flexion and extension strength at 60 and 240 deg/s, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, early postoperative pain and diary of analgesic use, and rate of reruptures. Outcome measures were evaluated before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Results: The ACL-QOL score improved over time for both groups (P < .001), and there were no significant differences between groups at any time point (P = .528). Significant differences in knee flexion and extension strength were found at 3 months after surgery. There were no differences between groups in IKDC knee assessment scores or rerupture rates. Conclusion: There does not appear to be any measurable benefit or drawback in quality of life to the use of an STG graft from the unaffected limb. In light of this finding, further research to examine other possible effects on agility and balance as well as time and ability to return to sport should be conducted.

This study was conducted to determine the overall prevalence of osteoarthritis and to identify the risk factors after ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis: Meniscus tears, time from injury to surgery, body mass index (BMI), residual laxity, and cartilage lesions influence the progression towards osteoarthritis. Materials and methods: This multicenter, retrospective study on the outcome of cruciate ligaments at 12 years of follow-up was conducted within the 2014 SOFCOT Symposium. The cohort included 675 arthroscopic reconstructions of the ACL from January 2002 to December 2003. The clinical evaluation included the objective and subjective IKDC score. Osteoarthritis was analyzed on 589 knee X-rays according to the IKDC classification. The predictive factors of osteoarthritis development studied were age, gender, BMI, time from injury to surgery, activity level, medial or lateral meniscectomy, type of graft, medial or lateral chondropathy, tunnel positioning, and residual laxity. Univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed. Results: The mean follow-up was 11.9 +/- 0.8 years. The subjective IKDC score was 83.7 +/- 13. At 12 years, the rate of moderate to severe osteoarthritis 1 (IKIX C or D) was 19% (16% medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, 4% lateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, and 2% patellofemoral osteoarthritis). The prognostic factors were age at surgery greater than 34 years (P<0.05), cartilage lesions at surgery (P<0.05), medial or lateral meniscectomy (P < 0.05), and residual laxity (A < 0.05). Conclusions: This large-scale study identified risk factors for osteoarthritis that should improve the information provided to patients on long-term progression after ACL reconstruction.

Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All adults with a first ACL rupture who underwent surgery with a PT or HS graft technique between January 2002 and December 2003 were included in the 2014 French Society of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology Symposium database. Baseline characteristics were collected. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of moderate to severe osteoarthritis in each group. The secondary endpoints included clinical subjective evaluations by the IKDC score and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. To control the differences in baseline characteristics, the data were analyzed with propensity score matching. Results: In the cohort, 541 patients from 18 centers were included: 311 PT and 230 HS ACL reconstructions. The baseline characteristics were similar after inverse probability weighting treatment (IPWT). The occurrence of osteoarthritis was similar after IPWT (19.3% for PT and 19.6% for HS, P = .94). Age at surgery >29 years and IKDC osteoarthritis stage B at the index surgery were identified as risk factors for moderate to severe osteoarthritis. Most functional outcomes were significantly higher in the HS group; however, the difference between groups remained <10 points. Of the 106 patients who needed a medial meniscectomy, the proportion of patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis was much higher in the HS group (43.5% vs 18.3%, P = .006).

Recently, the popularity of lateral extra-articular procedures has resurged, warranting an urgent evaluation of their safety profile. Purpose/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to perform an interim analysis of the ongoing SANTI randomized controlled trial to determine whether combined ACL and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ACL + ALLR) is associated with an increased rate of adverse outcomes when compared with isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The hypothesis was that there would be no significant difference between groups at a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Recruitment commenced in November 2016. Patients scheduled for ACLR were randomized to either isolated ACLR (with bone-patellar tendon-bone [BPTB] autograft) or combined ACL + ALLR (with hamstring tendon autograft). All patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year by March 2019 were included. The evaluated parameters included complications and reoperations, knee laxity parameters, range of motion, and scores on the Tegner, Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) instruments. Results: A total of 224 patients (112 in each group) with a mean +/- SD follow-up of 12.3 +/- 1.9 months (range, 12-19 months) formed the study population.

It was hypothesized that PRP treatment would reduce knee pain. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Fifty patients (mean +/- SD age, 30 +/- 12 years) undergoing BPTB ACL autograft reconstruction were randomized to the PRP (n = 27) or sham (n = 23) treatment. In either case, 10 mL of venous blood was drawn before the induction of anesthesia and either discarded (sham) or processed (PRP) for preparation of a PRP gel to be later mixed with donor site bone chips and inserted into the patellar defect.

Participants in each arm were randomized into a control group who underwent standard ACLR or an intervention group who had their grafts wrapped with an amnion collagen matrix during graft preparation, after which BMAC was injected under the wrap layers after implantation. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mapping/processing yielded mean T2* relaxation time and graft volume values at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Participants completed the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation Score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and pain visual analog scale. Statistical linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify the effects over time and the differences between the control and intervention groups. Adverse events were also recorded.Results:No significant differences were found at any time point between the intervention and control groups for BTB T2* (95% CI, -1.89 to 0.63; P = .31), BTB graft volume (95% CI, -606 to 876.1; P = .71), HS T2* (95% CI, -2.17 to 0.39; P = .162), or HS graft volume (95% CI, -11,141.1 to 351.5; P = .28). No significant differences were observed between the intervention and control groups of either graft type on any patient-reported outcome measure. No adverse events were reported after a 2-year follow-up.Conclusion:In this pilot study, wrapping a graft with an amnion collagen matrix and injecting BMAC appeared safe. MRI T2* values and graft volume of the augmented ACL graft were not significantly different from that of controls, suggesting that the intervention did not result in improved graft maturation.Registration:NCT03294759 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,11,11,,,,,,,2.32597E+16,10.1177/23259671231210035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23259671231210035,,,,,,,,38021297,,,,,WOS:001103832400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hypothesis: Surgical risk factors can be used to indicate whether reconstruction or conservative management is best for an individual patient. Study Design: Prospective nonrandomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Patients were classified as high, moderate, or low risk using preinjury sports participation and knee laxity measurements. Early anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (within 3 months of injury) was recommended to high-risk patients and conservative care to low-risk patients. It was recommended that moderate-risk patients have either early reconstruction or conservative care, according to the day of presentation. Assessment of subjective outcomes, activity, physical measurements, and radiographs was performed at mean follow-up of 6.6 years. Results: Early phase conservative management resulted in more late phase meniscus surgery than did early phase reconstruction at all risk levels (high risk, 25% vs 6.5%; moderate risk, 37% vs 7.7%, P = .01; low risk, 16% vs 0%). Early- and late-reconstruction patients' Tegner scores increased from presurgery to follow-up (P < .001) but did not return to preinjury levels. Early-reconstruction patients had higher rates of degenerative change on radiographs than did nonreconstruction patients (P < .05). Conclusions: Early phase reconstruction reduced late phase knee laxity, risk of symptomatic instability, and the risk of late meniscus tear and surgery. Moderate- and high-risk patients had similar rates of late phase injury and surgery. Reconstruction did not prevent the appearance of late degenerative changes on radiographs. Relationship between bone contusion on initial magnetic resonance images and the finding of degenerative changes on follow-up radiographs were not detected.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is a treatment that can counteract strength loss and serve as an adjunct to conventional therapy. Purpose: To compare the effect of adding traditional neuromuscular electrical stimulation (Polystim) or a novel garment-integrated neuromuscular electrical stimulation (Kneehab) to a standard postoperative rehabilitation program (control). Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Ninety-six patients, of a total enrolled cohort of 131 patients randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups, completed a standard rehabilitation program. In addition, the 2 neuromuscular electrical stimulation groups underwent 20-minute sessions of neuromuscular electrical stimulation 3 times a day, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks, in which stimulation was superimposed on isometric volitional contractions. Outcome measures including isokinetic strength of the knee extensors of the injured and uninjured leg at 90 and 180 deg/s, along with functional tests of proprioception, were assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months postoperatively. Results: The Kneehab group achieved significantly better results at each time point compared with the Polystim and control groups (P<.001). Extensor strength of the Kneehab group at speeds of 90 and 180 deg/s increased by 30.2% and 27.8%, respectively, between the preoperative measurements and the 6-month follow-up point in the injured leg. The corresponding changes for Polystim were 5.1% and 5%, whereas for the control group they were 6.6% and 6.7%, respectively. The mean single-legged hop test hop score of the Kneehab group improved by 50% between the 6-week and 6-month follow-up, whereas the corresponding changes for the Polystim and control groups were 26.3% and 26.2%, respectively. Although there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the Tegner score and the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 knee examination score, the Kneehab group showed a significant difference in mean improvement for the baseline corrected Lysholm score compared with the control group (P =.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-8.59) and with the Polystim group (P<.001; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-9.09) with no significant difference evident between Polystim and control groups (P =.97; 95% confidence interval, -4.23 to 3.51).

The objective was to compare outcomes between 2 commonly used laxity-based initial graft tension protocols. Hypotheses: (1) The high-tension group would have less knee laxity, improved clinical and patient-oriented outcomes, and less cartilage damage than would the low-tension group after 36 months of healing. (2) The outcomes of the high-tension group would be equivalent to those of a matched control group. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Ninety patients with isolated unilateral ACL injuries were randomized to undergo ACL reconstruction using 1 of 2 initial graft tension protocols: (1) autografts tensioned to restore normal anterior-posterior (AP) laxity at the time of surgery (ie, low tension; n = 46) and (2) autografts tensioned to overconstrain AP laxity by 2 mm (ie, high tension; n = 44). Sixty matched healthy patients formed the control group. Outcomes were assessed preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 6, 12, and 36 months after surgery. Results: No significant differences were found between the 2 initial graft tension protocols for any of the outcome measures at 36 months. However, there were differences when comparing the 2 treatment groups to the control group. On average, AP laxity was 2 mm greater in the ACL-reconstructed groups than in the control group (P < .007). International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee evaluation scores, peak isokinetic knee extension torques, and 4 of 5 Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were significantly worse than the control group (P < .001, P < .027, and P < .05, respectively). Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) scores and reinjury rates were similar between groups at 36 months. Although there were significant changes in radiography and magnetic resonance imaging present in the ACL-reconstructed knees of both treatment groups, the magnitude was relatively small and likely clinically insignificant at 36 months. Conclusion: Both laxity-based initial graft tension protocols produced similar outcomes without fully restoring joint function or patient-oriented outcomes (KOOS) when compared with the control group.

Purpose/Hypothesis: This study sought to assess the effect of initial graft tension and patient sex on PTOA outcomes at 10 to 12 years after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The hypothesis was that there would be no group- or sex-based differences in outcomes. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients were randomized to receive ACLR with a low or high initial graft tension. Outcomes were evaluated at 10 to 12 years postoperatively and compared with a matched, uninjured control group. Outcomes included clinical assessments (anteroposterior [AP] knee laxity measurement, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] examination score), a functional assessment (single-leg hop for distance), patient-reported outcomes (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Tegner activity level, patient satisfaction), and PTOA imaging (Osteoarthritis Research Society International [OARSI] radiographic score and Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score [WORMS]). Two-way mixed-model analyses of variance were used to evaluate differences in outcomes between tension groups and the control group and between female and male patients. Results: Both tension groups scored worse than the control group for the IKDC examination (P <= .021), KOOS (Pain, Activities of Daily Living, Sport/Recreation, and Quality of Life subscales) (P <= .049), and WORMS difference score (P <= .042). The low-tension group scored worse than the control group for KOOS Symptoms (P = .016) and the OARSI difference score (P = .015). The index limb had worse scores than the contralateral limb within the high-tension group for AP laxity (P = .030) and hop deficit (P = .011). This result was also observed within both tension groups for the WORMS (P <= .050) and within the low-tension group for the OARSI score (P = .001). Male patients had higher Tegner scores (mean +/- SE) relative to female patients (male, 5.49 +/- 1.88; female, 4.45 +/- 1.65) and worse OARSI difference scores (male, 1.89 +/- 5.38; female, 0.244 +/- 0.668) (P = .007 and .034, respectively). However, no significant differences were detected between tension groups for any of the outcomes measured. Conclusion: Overall, ACLR failed to prevent PTOA regardless of initial graft tension. However, male patients treated with a low initial graft tension may be at greater risk for PTOA.

Method In this diagnostic study, the translation, cross-culturally adaptation, and validation of the ACL-RSI was performed according to international guidelines. A total of 112 patients with ACL reconstruction participated in this study. All were capable of competitive sports before the injury and completed the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), and the Tegner activity score. Forty-eight patients completed the ACL-RSI (Cn) twice within two weeks. The validity was tested using seven premade hypotheses. Internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error was assessed.

METHODS We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 121 young, active adults with acute ACL injury in which we compared two strategies: structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and structured rehabilitation with the option of later ACL reconstruction if needed. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 2 years in the average score on four subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) - pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS4; range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). Secondary outcomes included results on all five KOOS subscales, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the score on the Tegner Activity Scale. RESULTS Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 1 did not undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction, 23 underwent delayed ACL reconstruction; the other 36 underwent rehabilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean KOOS4 score from baseline to 2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95% confidence interval, -6.5 to 6.8; P=0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary outcomes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received. CONCLUSIONS In young, active adults with acute ACL tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction.

Methods: Between 2005 and 2006, 20 patients (17 men, 3 women) with a primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized to obtain graft fixation in the tibial tunnel either by means of an interference screw (1) or a press-fit fixation with a porous bone cylinder (P). At 3 months after surgery, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the knee was performed, and tunnel enlargement was analyzed in the coronal and sagittal planes for the proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the tunnel.

Hypothesis: Patients with ACL injury can achieve good knee function and satisfactory long-term activity level when treated by early activity modification combined with rehabilitation. Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2. Materials and Methods: One hundred patients with an acute total ACL injury were observed for 15 years. All patients initially underwent arthroscopic surgery and a rehabilitation program. They were advised to modify their activity level, especially by avoiding contact sports. Patients with recurrent giving-way episodes and/or secondary meniscal injuries that required fixation (n = 6) were subsequently excluded and underwent reconstruction (n = 22). Sixty-seven patients with unilateral nonreconstructed ACL injury remained at the 15-year follow-up. The Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity level, and a visual analog score for global knee function were recorded at regular intervals. At the final follow-up, patients were further evaluated with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form. Results: Forty patients resumed their preinjury activity level or higher within 3 years.

A new treatment option is to administer autologous conditioned serum (ACS) containing endogenous anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1Ra and growth factors (IGF-1, PDGF, and TGF-beta 1, among others) in the liquid blood phase. The purpose of this trial was to establish whether the postoperative outcome could be affected by intraarticular application of ACS. Methods In a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups, 62 patients were treated. Bone tunnel width was measured by CT scans, while clinical efficacy was assessed by patient-administered outcome instruments (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) up to 1 year following the ACL reconstruction in patients receiving either ACS (Group A) or placebo (Group B). We compared the levels and dynamics of IL-1 beta concentrations in the synovial liquid and examined the correlation between the levels of IL-1 beta at three different postoperative points. Results Bone tunnel enlargement was significantly less (6 months: 8%, 12 months: 13%) in Group A than in Group B (6 months: 31%, 12 months: 38%). Clinical outcomes (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) were consistently better in patients treated with ACS at all data points and for all outcome parameters, and there were statistically significant differences in the WOMAC stiffness subscale after 1 year. The decrease in IL-1 beta synovial fluid concentration was more pronounced in the ACS group, and values were lower, to a statistically significant degree, in the ACS group at day 10. Conclusion The intraarticular administration/injection of ACS results in decreased bone tunnel widening after ACL reconstructive surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2011,19,,,1,,,S36,S46,,10.1007/s00167-011-1458-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-011-1458-4,,,,,,,,21360125,,,,,WOS:000297736600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there are no clinical trials that evaluated outcomes of OKC exercises in a restricted ROM for pain, function, muscle strength, and anterior knee laxity at 1 year after surgery. Purpose: To determine if an early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strength in a restricted ROM would promote a clinical improvement without causing increased anterior knee laxity in patients after ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 49 patients between 16 and 50 years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus and gracilis autografts were randomly assigned to an early start OKC (EOKC) exercise group or a late start OKC (LOKC) exercise group. The EOKC group (n = 25; mean age, 26 years) received a rehabilitation protocol with an early start of OKC (fourth week postoperatively) within a restricted ROM between 45 degrees and 90 degrees. The LOKC group (n = 24; mean age, 24 years) performed the same protocol with a late start of OKC exercises between 0 degrees and 90 degrees (12th week postoperatively). Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Lysholm knee scoring scale, single-legged and crossover hop tests, and anterior knee laxity were measured to assess outcomes at the 12-week, 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month postoperative follow-up (range, 13-24 months). Results: No difference (P<.05) was noted between groups with respect to demographic data. Both groups (EOKC and LOKC) had a higher level of function and less pain at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month assessments when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P<.05). The EOKC group had improved quadriceps muscle strength at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month follow-up when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P<.05); the LOKC group showed improvement only at the 17-month postoperative assessment. However, the analysis between groups showed no difference for all pain and functional assessments, including anterior knee laxity (P>.05). Conclusion: An early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strengthening in a restricted ROM did not differ from a late start in terms of anterior knee laxity. The EOKC group reached the same findings in relation to pain decrease and functional improvement when compared with the LOKC group but showed a faster recovery in quadriceps strength. The nonweightbearing exercises seem appropriate for patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction, when utilized in a specific ROM. The magnitude of difference in quadriceps strength between the 2 rehabilitation protocols was around 5%; however, this difference was not clinically significant, especially because both groups had equal function on the hop tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2013,41,4,,,,,788,794,,10.1177/0363546513476482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546513476482,,,,,,,,23423316,,,,,WOS:000318295500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The modified Brostrom-Gould (MBG) procedure remains the gold standard; however, there are a number of relative contraindications to this procedure, and the longer-term outcomes after the MBG have been questioned. An alternative procedure is augmentation of a primary repair with a ligament augmentation reconstruction system (LARS). Purpose: To conduct a randomized controlled trial testing the null-hypothesis that there is no difference in patient scored outcomes and activity levels, between patients undergoing a MBG procedure compared with those undergoing a primary repair with LARS augmentation, for lateral ligament instability of the ankle. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria were invited to take part in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to undergo the LARS or MBG procedure. Both groups followed similar postoperative rehabilitation. Patients completed the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) before surgery and then at 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery. Tegner activity scores were recorded at 5years. The scores in the 2 groups were compared via statistical analysis (P < .05). Results: Of the 50 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria, 47 agreed to take part in the study. Twenty-two were randomized to the LARS group and 25 to the MBG group. At 5 years, follow-up data were complete for 20 patients in the LARS group and 21 in the MBG. There were 2 failures in the MBG group and 0 in the LARS group. The LARS group had significantly better improvement in total FAOS at 1 year (mean +/- SD, 92.4 +/- 2.5 vs 78.2 +/- 3.4, P = .005), 2 years (94.0 +/- 3.0 vs 78.0 +/- 5.2, P = .003), and 5 years (93.7 +/- 6.0 vs 75.1 +/- 5.5, P = .002) after surgery. The 5-year Tegner activity scores were higher in the LARS group (8.25 +/- 1.1 vs 7.2 +/- 0.9, P = .03). Conclusion: Among physically active patients with chronic lateral ligament instability, primary repair combined with LARS results in better total FAOS at 5-year follow-up and higher Tegner activity scores as compared with the MBG procedure.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate ACL graft and contralateral rupture following ipsilateral or contralateral semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) graft harvest at follow-up of a minimum 10 years post-reconstruction in the treatment of a complete ACL tear. Methods Patients from a previous randomized trial were evaluated. The primary outcome measures were ipsilateral and contralateral reinjury as well as the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, the ACL Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QoL) and the Tegner activity scale. Participants completed four different single-leg hop tests and concentric knee flexion and extension strength were assessed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Results Of the original 100 patients, 50 patients (41.3 +/- 9.5 years of age, 31 males, 19 females) reported on re-injury at 12.6 +/- 1.4 years post-operative. Thirty-eight patients returned for full assessment and 12 responded by mail or phone survey. There were no differences between groups for graft rupture, contralateral injury, ACL-QoL score, IKDC categorization, or anterior tibial translation, though both groups experienced a reduction in the Tegner Activity Scale from their preinjury scores. There was no difference in knee flexor and extensor isokinetic concentric strength, or single leg hop test performance. Knee flexor strength limb symmetry index was reduced when measured in the supine relative to the seated position in both groups, indicating persistent deficits in knee flexor strength when measured in the supine position. Conclusion Contralateral hamstring harvest does not put patients at an increased risk of a contralateral ACL tear and long-term outcomes of ACL reconstruction do not differ based on the side of graft harvest. Contralateral STG harvest may provide a safe alternative surgical option for select patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2022,30,11,,,,,3718,3725,,10.1007/s00167-022-06980-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00167-022-06980-x,,MAY 2022,,,,,,35507037,,,,,WOS:000790611800001,View Full Record in Web of Science
