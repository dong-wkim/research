The purpose of the study was to assess the clinical effectiveness of the EndoPearl using the KT-1000 Knee Arthrometer and the Mohtadi ACL Quality of Life (ACL-QOL) Questionnaire. Hypothesis: The application of the EndoPearl in hamstring ACL reconstruction has no significant benefit when compared to conventional treatment in KT-1000 and ACL-QOL Questionnaire outcomes. Study Design: Prospective single-blind randomized clinical trial. Methods: ACL reconstruction with autogenous semitendinosus and gracilis tendons was performed on 35 patients. Preoperatively, 3 months, 6 months, and 18 months postoperatively, patients' knees were evaluated using the KT-1000 Knee Arthrometer and the ACL-QOL Questionnaire. Results: Statistically significant differences were achieved in terms of KT-1000 side-to-side differences between the study group and the control group at 6 months and 18 months postoperatively; the mean side-to-side differences are significantly less in the study group when compared to the control group. Statistically significant differences were not detected when comparing the ACL-QOL Questionnaire between the two groups at all time intervals. Conclusion: The application of the EndoPearl in conjunction with a bioscrew in the femoral tunnel in autogenous ACL reconstruction using semitendinosus and gracilis tendon grafts provides a significantly decreased laxity up to 18 months postoperatively in terms of KT-1000 side-to-side differences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN-FEB,2004,32,1,,,,,159,163,,10.1177/0095399703258675,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0095399703258675,,,,,,,,14754739,,,,,WOS:000220711300021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: Ten patients with subacute (<= 3 months after injury) anterior cruciate ligament rupture were randomly allocated to undergo DB ACLR with suturing of the ruptured tissue to hamstring graft (n = 5) or conventional DB ACLR (n 5). When autologous ruptured tissue was used, remnant ruptured tissue was then harvested, divided into 4 pieces, placed between the loops at the distal and proximal portions of the graft, and secured with the suture. As the primary endpoint, tunnel volume assessment by 3-dimensional multie-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) was performed 1 year after ACLR. To assess the efficacy of these procedures, the Lysholm score, anterior tibial translation (measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer [MEDmetric, San Diego, CA]), and rotational instability (measured by the pivot-shift test) were evaluated after 2 years. Results: Tunnel volume enlargement between 3 weeks and 1 year after ACLR as assessed by 3-dimensional MDCT was significantly less for ACLR using ruptured tissue than for conventional ACLR, especially at the femoral site (P<.05). However, the postoperative Lysholm score, anterior stability of the knee measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer, and rate of negative manual pivot-shift test results did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. There was no correlation to the clinical outcomes in terms of tunnel size. Conclusions: The Lysholm score, anterior laxity measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer, and rotational instability according to the pivot-shift test did not differ significantly between ACLR using ruptured tissue and the conventional technique. However, ACLR using ruptured tissue produced less femoral tunnel enlargement as assessed by MDCT, warranting further long-term follow-up to elucidate its effectiveness.

Hypothesis: Different PLB fixation angles would affect clinical outcomes in DB ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: This study prospectively included 90 patients who underwent primary DB ACL reconstruction with an autologous semitendinosus tendon. The PLB fixation angles were randomly set as follows: 0 degrees of flexion (P0; n = 30), 20 degrees (P20; n = 30), and 45 degrees (P45; n = 30). In all groups, the anteromedial bundle was fixed at 20 degrees of flexion. The following evaluation methods were used at the preoperative period and at 3, 6, and 9 months and 1 and 2 years after the surgery: clinical examination, KT-1000 arthrometer measurement, muscle strength, Tegner score, Lysholm score, and subjective rating scale regarding patient satisfaction and sports performance levels. Graft retear, contralateral ACL tear, and additional meniscus surgery were also recorded. Results: Seventy-five patients (P0, n = 25; P20, n = 26; P45, n = 24) who were followed for 2 years were evaluated. Preoperatively, there were no differences among the groups. Postoperatively, pivot-shift test results in the P0 and P20 groups were better than those in the P45 group (P0, n = 23 graded negative and 2 graded 1+; P20, n = 23 and 2; P45, n = 15 and 7, respectively; P0 vs P45: P = .038 and P20 vs P45: P = .038). Average KT-1000 arthrometer laxity measurements were better in the P20 group than in the P45 group (P0, 0.4 mm; P20, 0.3 mm; P45, 1.3 mm; P20 vs P45: P = .048), and there were more patients with graft failure (KT-1000 measurement, 4 mm) in the P45 group (n = 3) than the P0 and P20 groups (each, n = 0). There were no significant differences in range of motion, other laxity tests, muscle strength, Tegner score, Lysholm score, subjective rating scale, or additional surgery. Conclusion: In DB ACL reconstruction, when the anteromedial bundle was fixed at 20 degrees of flexion, fixation of the PLB at 45 degrees was worse than fixation at 0 degrees and 20 degrees with respect to anterior and rotational stability during the 2-year follow-up.

Purpose: This trial was conducted to compare postoperative outcomes in patients using an ACL functional knee brace and patients using a neoprene knee sleeve. Hypothesis: Patients using a brace will have superior outcomes than those using a sleeve. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: One hundred fifty patients were randomized to receive a brace (n = 76) or neoprene sleeve ( n = 74) at their 6-week postoperative visit after primary ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft. Patients were assessed preoperatively, then 6 weeks and 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Outcome measures included disease-specific quality of life (Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Quality of Life [ACL-QOL] Questionnaire), anterior tibial translation (KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference), the single-limb forward hop test ( limb symmetry index), and Tegner Activity Scale. Outcomes at 1 and 2 years were compared after adjusting for baseline scores. Subjective ratings of how patients felt while using the brace/sleeve were also collected for descriptive purposes using a questionnaire. Four a priori directional subgroup hypotheses were evaluated using tests for interactions. Results: There were no significant differences between brace (n = 62) and sleeve ( n = 65) groups for any of the outcomes at 1-and 2-year follow-ups. Adjusted mean differences at 2 years were as follows: -0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], -7.52 to 5.64) for the ACL-QOL Questionnaire, -0.10 mm ( 95% CI, -0.99 to 0.81) for KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference, -0.87% ( 95% CI, -8.89 to 7.12) for hop limb symmetry index, and -0.05 ( 95% CI, -0.72 to 0.62) for the Tegner Activity Scale. Subjective ratings of confidence in the knee provided by the brace/ sleeve were higher for the brace group than the sleeve group. Subgroup findings were minimal. Adverse events were few and similar between groups. Conclusions: A functional knee brace does not result in superior outcomes compared with a neoprene sleeve after ACL reconstruction.

Previous studies have provided evidence that offers conflicting opinions concerning the most favorable graft choice. Purpose:To identify whether the use of a quadrupled semitendinosus tendon (ST) or doubled semitendinosus tendon and gracilis tendon (ST/G) graft provides comparable anterior tibial translation (ATT) with similar functional results and similar donor site morbidity. Study Design:Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods:This was a prospective, patient- and surgeon-blinded, randomized trial set in a busy orthopaedic and traumatology department at a university hospital. Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 162 patients with ACL lesions were randomized to undergo ACLR with either a quadrupled ST or doubled ST/G graft. The primary endpoint was ATT assessed with the KT-1000 arthrometer. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of the visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective evaluation form, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner activity scale, and Lysholm knee scoring scale. Results:Preoperative demographic data, ATT, and PROM scores showed no significant differences. At 4.5 years, no significant differences were found between the ST and ST/G groups with respect to PROM scores and KT-1000 arthrometer, Lachman test, and pivot-shift test findings. Differences in functional results between groups were significant (muscle strength). Subgroup analysis revealed significantly increased ATT in female patients undergoing ACLR with a quadrupled ST graft during the 4.5-year observation period, as assessed by the KT-1000 arthrometer, as well as inferior KOOS, IKDC, Lysholm, and VAS scores. Conclusion:This study showed a significant increase in ATT as well as inferior results on PROMs during a 4.5-year observation period in female patients undergoing ACLR with a quadrupled ST graft. In male patients, the study provided evidence of the noninferiority of ACLR with an ST graft, with no influence on donor site morbidity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,51,3,,,,,615,626,,10.1177/03635465221149738,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03635465221149738,,,,,,,,36856280,,,,,WOS:000942491200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

From 2006 to 2009, a total of 62 patients who underwent single-bundle ACL reconstruction with a quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the preserving-remnant group and the removing-remnant group. Plain radiographs were taken at 1 week, and 3, 6, and 24 months postoperatively, and tibial tunnel enlargement was evaluated. The postoperative clinical assessment included the Lysholm rating scale and KT-1000 measurement. In total, 27 patients in the preserving-remnant group and 24 patients in the removing-remnant group were followed up and the median follow-up was 24.5 months (range 24-27 months). Tibial tunnel enlargement occurred within 6 months postoperatively. Positive enlargement was observed in 8 patients (29.6 %) in the preserving-remnant group and 14 patients (58.3 %) in the removing-remnant group (P = 0.0388). The percentage of tibial tunnel enlargement was 25.7 +/- A 6.7 and 34.0 +/- A 8.9 % in the preserving- and removing-remnant groups, respectively (P = 0.0004). In the preserving-remnant group, the average Lysholm score increased from 60.3 +/- A 5.3 (51-69) to 93.0 +/- A 3.5 (88-100), and the side-to-side difference of the KT-1000 changed from 6.3 +/- A 0.9 (5.1-8.0) to 1.4 +/- A 0.6 (0.5-2.4) mm. In the removing-remnant group, the average Lysholm score increased from 58.7 +/- A 6.5 (48-71) to 91.1 +/- A 3.9 (85-100), and the side-to-side difference of the KT-1000 changed from 6.5 +/- A 0.8 (5.4-8.2) to 1.7 +/- A 0.6 (0.6-2.8) mm.

Methods: Skeletally mature candidates younger than 24 years old with an ACL tear were randomized into either the AIST (n = 32) or BPTB (n = 32) group and were followed for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained at 1-year follow-up, and radiographs were obtained at 2-year follow-up. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using an anteromedial portal to establish the femoral tunnel. The primary outcome measure was KT-1000 stability testing. Secondary outcome measures included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Knee Evaluation Form, IKDC Subjective Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Marx Activity Scale, visual analog pain scale, and SF-12 (Mental and Physical). Results: At 2-year follow-up, no statistical difference existed with KT-1000-measured side-to-side laxity between AIST (0.3 +/- 0.7 mm, 95% confidence interval 0.0-1.0 mm) and BPTB (0.0 +/- 0.8 mm, confidence interval CI -0.3 to 1.1 mm) (P = .197).

Hypothesis: There is no difference in postoperative range of motion or stability after ACL reconstructions performed either acutely or delayed. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients with an acute ACL tear were prospectively randomized to either early ( within 21days) or delayed ( beyond 6 weeks) reconstruction using autograft hamstring tendon. Previous knee surgery on the index extremity and a multiligamentous injury were exclusionary criteria. Surgical technique and postoperative rehabilitation were identical for all patients. Postoperative assessments included range of motion and KT-1000 arthrometer measurements compared with the contralateral knee. Standardized outcome measures were used including single assessment numeric evaluation (SANE), Lysholm, and Tegner Activity Score. Results: Seventy consecutive patients were enrolled, and 1 patient was dropped after a postoperative infection. Sixty-nine patients ( 34 acute, 35 delayed) with an average age of 27 years composed the study cohort. The mean time from injury to surgery was 9 days ( range, 2-17 days) for patients in the early group and 85 days (range, 42-192) for those in the delayed group. The average follow-up from surgery was 366 days ( range, 185-869). Articular cartilage and meniscal injuries were comparable between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in degrees of extension or flexion lost relative to the nonoperative side, operative time, KT-1000 arthrometer differences, or subjective knee evaluations. Conclusion: Excellent clinical results can be achieved after ACL reconstructions performed soon after injury using autograft hamstrings.

Previous studies with 2-, 5- and 10-year follow-up are conflicted as to whether this technique is superior to the previous gold standard method of ACL reconstruction, the anatomic single-bundle (SB) reconstruction. Purpose/Hypothesis: The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the outcomes of the anatomic DB technique and anatomic SB technique with independent drilling at 10 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. We hypothesized that DB ACL reconstruction would result in a better outcome in terms of the pivot-shift test. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 105 patients (33 women, 72 men; median age, 27 years [range, 18-52 years]) were randomized and underwent ACL reconstruction (DB group: n = 53; SB group: n = 52). All reconstruction procedures were performed anatomically by identifying the ACL footprint, using the anteromedial portal for femoral tunnel drilling, and utilizing interference screws for tibial and femoral fixation. One blinded observer examined the patients both preoperatively and at follow-up (median, 120 months [range, 112-134 months]). Multiple subjective and objective clinical evaluations were used to assess the outcomes. Radiographic assessments of osteoarthritis were performed using the Ahlback, Kellgren-Lawrence, and Fairbank classification systems early postoperatively and at the final follow-up. Results: Preoperatively, no differences were found between the study groups. Overall, 70 patients (67%; DB group: n = 39; SB group: n = 31) were available for analysis at 10-year follow-up. No significant difference could be shown between the groups in terms of the pivot-shift grade, knee laxity measurements using the KT-1000 arthrometer, manual Lachman grade, single-leg hop test result, range of motion measurements, Lysholm knee score, Tegner activity score, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) score. Correspondingly, no differences were found between the groups regarding the presence of radiographic osteoarthritis at follow-up.

Few randomized trials have evaluated differences in these techniques with respect to clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are any differences in clinical outcome between the AMP and TT approaches. This is a single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to undergo ACL reconstruction using the AMP or TT approach. The primary outcome measure was the ACL quality of life (ACL-QOL), and secondary outcomes were the IKDC knee assessment, side-to-side difference in anterior-posterior knee laxity (KT-1000) and tunnel orientation (X-ray findings) at preoperative, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperative. Statistical comparisons were performed using a series of t tests for independent groups with equal variance. Ninety-six participants were consented and randomized between 2007 and 2011 with eight excluded postrandomization. Mean (SD) preoperative ACL-QOL was 33 (13) for TT and 36 (17) for AMP and improved significantly (p < 0.001) in both groups to 79 (18) and 78 (18) at 24 months postoperative, respectively. The preoperative median IKDC grade for both groups was C and improved similarly in both groups at 24 months (n.s.). There was no side-to-side difference in knee laxity based on KT-1000 measurements with a mean (SD) 1 (3) mm between affected and unaffected limbs in the TT group compared to 1 (3) mm for the AMP group. A significant difference was found in femoral tunnel orientation with the AMP group at 43A degrees (7) and the TT group 58A degrees (8) in the coronal plane (p < 0.001).

Hypothesis: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft would have a better clinical outcome and reduce the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement compared with a conventional method because of the enhanced anchoring between the tendon graft and the bone. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients (N = 64) with unilateral ACL rupture underwent arthroscopically assisted single-bundle ACL reconstruction using a 4-strand semitendinosus tendon or 4-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendons with EndoButton femoral fixation and screw washer tibial fixation. These patients were equally randomized to undergo the CaP (n = 32) or conventional (n = 32) method using a transtibial tunnel approach according to the closed envelope method. In the CaP group, the tendon graft was hybridized with the CaP at both ends of the graft. One surgeon performed all reconstructions without knowing which graft was prepared. Patients' backgrounds regarding age at surgery, gender, period before surgery, and associated meniscal injuries were similar in the 2 groups. All patients followed the same postoperative protocol. At 1 and 2 years after surgery, they were evaluated with the manual knee laxity test, KT-1000 arthrometry, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) examination form, Tegner scale, and Lysholm scale. Also, 1 year postoperatively, bone tunnel enlargement was analyzed using computed tomography, intensity of the tendon graft by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tendon graft appearance by arthroscopic examination. All the examinations were performed blindly. Results: All patients underwent a minimum 2-year follow-up. KT-1000 arthrometry data indicated statistically significant decreased average anterior tibial translation in the CaP group compared with the conventional method group: 1.0 +/- 2.0 mm versus 1.9 +/- 1.6 mm (P < .05), respectively, at 1 year; 1.6 +/- 2.1 mm versus 2.6 +/- 2.4 mm (P < .05), respectively, at 2 years. The Lysholm score was higher in the CaP group than in the conventional method group at 2 years (96.9 +/- 4.3 vs 91.7 +/- 13.3, P < .05). The CaP-hybridized tendon graft reduced the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement of the anteroposterior diameter at the main joint aperture site 1 year postoperatively (femoral side: 15.5% +/- 13.4% vs 22.1% +/- 16.4%, P < .05; tibial side: 19.3% +/- 17.1% vs 26.1% +/- 13.7%, P < .05). The results of the pivot-shift test, IKDC grade, and Tegner score; the intensity of the tendon graft (MRI); and arthroscopic appearance were not significantly different at both follow-up periods in the 2 groups. Conclusion: The CaP-hybridized tendon graft improved anterior knee stability and Lysholm scores at the 2-year follow-up and improved anterior knee stability and reduced the percentage of bone tunnel enlargement in both tunnels at the 1-year follow-up compared with the conventional method for single-bundle ACL reconstruction.

Prospective, randomized long-term studies are needed to determine the differences between the graft materials. Hypothesis: Eleven years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction there is no difference in functional outcome and quality of life between patients with patellar tendon or hamstring tendon autografts; however, the patients with patellar tendon autograft would have a higher prevalence of osteoarthritis. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: From June 1999 to March 2000, 64 patients were included in this prospective study. A single surgeon performed primary arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in an alternating sequence. In 32 patients, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed with hamstring tendon autograft (semitendinosus and gracilis [STG] group) while in the other 32 patients the reconstruction was performed with patellar tendon autograft (PT group). Results: At the 11-year follow-up, no statistically significant differences were seen with respect to the Lysholm score and Short Form-36, KT-1000 arthrometer laxity testing, anterior knee pain, single-legged hop test, or International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) classification results.

Results: No differences have been detected between the groups for the objective item assessed. Male patients' subjective IKDC score was statistically better for the ST3 group. Recreational soccer players showed a higher Lysholm and subjective IKDC score in ST3 group compared to GST group. There was no difference regarding the return to sport.

Methods: During the reconstructive procedure, the hamstring tendon graft was prepared as a bone-hamstring-bone graft; both bone-patellar tendon-bone and bone-hamstring-bone grafts were fixed with interference screws. Eighty consecutive patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were randomly assigned to either bone-patellar tendon-bone or bone-hamstring-bone groups. Follow-up examinations were performed for at least 5 years postoperatively. Seventy-two of the 80 patients (37 patients in the bone-patellar tendon-bone group and 35 in the bone-hamstring-bone group) were evaluated, with a mean follow-up period of 87.0 and 80.8 months, respectively. Follow-up examinations were performed using the International Knee Documentation Committee knee ligament standard and subjective knee forms. Results: The mean KT-1000 arthrometer evaluation results showed no significant difference between the. bone-patellar tendon-bone and bone-hamstring-bone groups (1.2 +/- 2.1 mm and 1.7 +/- 1.4 mm, respectively; P = .24). However, symptoms related to graft harvest (anterior kneeling pain) were more frequently observed in the bone-patellar tendon-bone group, and unsatisfactory results were correlated with severe kneeling pain in 3 patients from this group (P = .0056). Significant hamstring muscle weakness without complaint of functional deficit was found in the bone-hamstring-bone group (P = .0045). Conclusion: Bone-hamstring-bone grafts were shown to reduce the risk of problems at the graft harvest site compared to bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts, with comparable results in the remaining clinical parameters tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2006,34,2,,,,,213,219,,10.1177/0363546505279919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546505279919,,,,,,,,16282583,,,,,WOS:000235006000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hypothesis: There are no differences in the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis or knee function in patients undergoing reconstruction of a torn anterior cruciate ligament with 4-strand hamstring autograft versus patellar tendon-bone autograft. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Seventy-two patients with subacute or chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament were randomly assigned to autograft reconstruction with 4-strand gracilis and semitendinosus tendon (HAM) (N = 37) or with patellar tendon-bone (PTB) (IN = 35) from the ipsilateral side. Outcome measurements were the Cincinnati knee score, single-legged hop tests, isokinetic muscle strength tests, pain, knee joint laxity test (KT-1000 arthrometer), and a radiologic evaluation (Kellgren and Lawrence) at 10-year follow-up. Results: At 10 years, 57 patients (79%) were eligible for evaluation-29 in the HAM group and 28 in the PTB group. No differences were found between the 2 graft groups with respect to the Cincinnati knee score, the single-legged hop tests, pain, muscle strength measurements, or knee joint laxity. Fifty-five percent and 64% of the patients had osteoarthritis corresponding to Kellgren and Lawrence grade 2 or more in the HAM and the PTB groups, respectively (P = .27). For the uninvolved knee, the corresponding numbers were 28% and 22% (P = .62). Conclusion: At 10 years postoperatively, no statistically significant differences in clinical outcome between the 2 graft types were found. The prevalence of osteoarthritis was significantly higher in the operated leg than in the contralateral leg, but there were no significant differences between the 2 groups.

We investigated whether minimal debridement of the intercondylar notch and the residual stump of the ruptured ACL leads to earlier revascularisation in ACL reconstruction in humans. We undertook a randomised controlled clinical trial in which 49 patients underwent ACL reconstruction using autologous four-strand hamstring tendon grafts. Randomised by the use of sealed envelopes, 25 patients had a conventional clearance of the intercondylar notch and 24 had a minimal debridement method. Three patients were excluded from the study. All patients underwent MR scanning postoperatively at 2, 6 and 12 months, together with clinical assessment using a KT-1000 arthrometer and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation. All observations were made by investigators blinded to the surgical technique. Signal intensity was measured in 4 mm diameter regions of interest along the ACL graft and the mid-substance of the posterior cruciate ligament. Our results indicate that minimal debridement leads to earlier revascularisation within the mid-substance of the ACL graft at two months (paired t-test, p = 0.002). There was a significant reduction of mid-substance signal six months after the minimal debridement technique (paired t-test, p = 0.00007).

Type of Study: Prospective randomized study. Methods: One hundred patients were included and randomized and 87 patients were assessed at a 1-year follow-up. The evaluation included standardized radiographs, KT-1000 data, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) ratings, and Lysholm score. The diameter of the tunnel at the 1 year follow-up was, after correction for magnification, compared with the tunnel diameter of the radiograph from 2 weeks postoperatively. A more than 2-mm enlargement was considered TW. Results: In group A in which transfixation in the femur and interference screw in the tibia was used, 7 of 41 patients had developed femoral TW and 5 of 41 tibial TW. In group B, 20 of 46 patients had TW in the femur and 16 of 46 in the tibia (P <.05, chi-square test). No significant difference was found with respect to Lysholm score, IKDC, or arthrometric evaluation. Conclusions: There was a significant reduction of TW in both the femur and the tibia using fixation points close to the joint, compared with the system where the distance between the fixation points is long.

BMD (primary outcome) at the proximal tibia, distal femur, femoral neck and trochanteric region was measured blindly at day 1, 3 months, 5 months and 1 year after surgery. KT-1000, Lysholm, IKDC, one-leg hop test and Lachman test were performed blindly at baseline and 1 year post-reconstruction. Results: There was a significant bone loss at the injured knee and hip at 3 and 5 months which was reversible at the knee, but not at the hip, at 1 year post-operation. There was a significant improvement of early clinical and functional outcomes at 1 year. No significant differences in bone loss was detected among different surgical techniques, except BMD loss at the femoral neck, though a trend of greater BMD loss in the HT-SB group at 5 months after reconstruction was observed. There was a significant positive correlation between BMD at the distal femur and the single-leg hop distance at 1 year.

The WBVT group demonstrated significantly better postural control, muscle performance, single-legged hop, and shuttle run (P<.05) than the reference group, but there was no significant difference in knee joint position sense, triple hop, carioca, ROM, and stability (P>.05). Conclusion: Early WBVT started from 1 month postoperatively was an effective training method without compromising knee ROM and stability. It improved postural control, isokinetic performance, single-legged hop, and shuttle run but not knee joint position sense, triple hop, and carioca.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2013,41,4,,,,,804,814,,10.1177/0363546513476473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546513476473,,,,,,,,23460328,,,,,WOS:000318295500020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: A total of 64 patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the use of 5-strand and 4-strand semitendinosus-gracilis autografts in single bundle ACL reconstruction (n = 32 in each group). Four participants in each group were lost to follow-up and were excluded from the outcome analysis. The outcomes of 28 patients in the 5-strand group and 28 patients in the 4-strand group were analyzed. The diameters of all grafts were measured intraoperatively. Patients were assessed post-operatively at 2 years with objective assessments (anterior knee laxity using the KT-2000 arthrometer, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, hop test) and patient-reported outcome scores (Lysholm knee score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee score, SF-36 physical and mental components, Tegner activity scale). Postoperative graft ruptures were also noted. Results: There were improvements in all outcome measures postoperatively regardless of the number of graft strands. When we compared the study and control groups, there were no significant differences in all subjective and objective outcome measures except the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score symptoms score (5-strand group 93.3 +/- 9.2 vs 4-strand group 86.2 +/- 14.7, P = .04). The KT-2000 side-to-side difference was 2.79 +/- 2.11 mm in the 5-strand group and 2.54 +/- 1.75 mm in the 4-strand group (P = .63). The 5-strand study group had 2 graft ruptures at 1 year, whereas the 4-strand control group had one partial graft rupture at 6 months.

Between these two grafts might be differences in stability, morbidity, or long-term changes. This study investigates outcomes of ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon versus semitendinosus tendon autografts. We hypothesize no significant differences in clinical outcome and knee stability between both groups. In a randomized prospective trial, we operated 62 ACL-deficient patients, 45 males and 17 females with a mean age of 29.8 years (min. 18, max. 44). We reconstructed the ligament using either autologous patellar tendon (n = 31) or semitendinosus tendon (n = 31). After 10 years of follow-up, we investigated 47 patients of the study. For evaluation we used a standard clinical examination including one-leg jump test and KT-1000 instrumental translation measure, visual analog pain scale, IKDC subjective knee form, Lysholm score, Tegner activity scale, and standard X-rays of the knee. The data did not show any significant differences between the two groups. Between 5 and 10 years after ACL reconstruction both groups started to develop degenerative arthritic changes, which were detectable in standard radiographs of the knee. At 10-year follow-up mean IKDC for the BPTB group was 1.8 (min. 1, max. 3) and for the ST group it was 2.2 (min 1, max. 4), p = 0.35. Regarding Tegner activity scale after 10 years, the BPTB group showed a mean score of 5.9 (min. 4, max. 9) versus 5.1 (min. 3, max. 7) in the ST group, p = 0.53. For the Lysholm score the BPTB group reached a mean of 92.0 (min. 63, max. 98) and the ST group 91.8 (min. 62, max. 98) points, p = 0.66. There is a tendency for higher donor site morbidity in the BPTB group than in the ST group, p = 0.07. Both, patellar tendon and semitendinosus tendon are safe autografts for ACL reconstruction. Regarding graft selection, individual patient-dependent factors should be considered.

Applying the appropriate tension to the final graft reconstruction has traditionally been performed by the surgeon and is based on the surgeon's experience and perception of applied tension. Problems with manual application of tension to the ACL reconstruction include under- or overtightening the reconstruction, inconsistent tension application among subjects, and variable load application to each strand. Purpose: To assess whether measured tensioning of hamstring ACL grafts during fixation improves clinical outcome or knee laxity postoperatively when compared with conventional tensioning maneuvers. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: This was a prospective randomized controlled trial of consecutive primary ACL patients. The device group included patients in whom a measured tensioning device was used for graft tensioning (80 N), and the physician group did not use a tensioning device. The primary outcome was KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side laxity differences between knees at 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Quality of Life Questionnaire (ACL-QoL) at those intervals. Chi-square and t tests were used for analysis. The study had 90% power to detect a difference of 2 mm between groups. Results: A sample of 127 patients was randomized. Of those, 14 did not have follow-up data and were excluded from this analysis, resulting in a final sample of 113 (55 patients in the device group and 58 in the physician group). No significant differences were found in baseline demographics or comorbidities. There were no significant differences between the groups (physician vs device) at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months in side-to-side laxity (4.6 vs 4.7 mm, 1.6 vs 1.3 mm, 1.5 vs 1.3 mm, and 1.1 vs 1.0 mm, respectively), IKDC score (58.2 vs 56.4, 72.0 vs 67.9, 79.9 vs 76.0, and 81.3 vs 78.5, respectively), or ACL-QoL score (998.2 vs 901.2, 1846.4 vs 1647.5, 2150.4 vs 2268.3, and 2436.9 vs 2231.8, respectively).

Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A randomized series of 77 patients, all with a unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture, were divided into 2 groups (PLLA and metal). In both groups, hamstring tendon autografts were used with interference screw fixation at both ends and the patients were examined with standard radiographs, Tegner activity level, Lysholm knee score, single-legged hop test, early C-reactive protein response, and KT-1000 arthrometer knee laxity measurements. Results: The preoperative assessments in both groups were similar in terms of gender, clinical tests, and the time from injury to surgery. The patients returned for a radiographic and clinical examination a mean of 96 months (range, 78-120 months) after the index operation. The PLLA group displayed significantly larger bone tunnels on the radiographs than the metal group on the femoral side (mean, 11.4 mm [range, 0-17.8 mm] vs 8.0 mm [range, 0-16.3 mm]; P < .005) but not on the tibial side (mean, 10.7 mm [range, 7.8-14.1 mm] vs 10.5 mm [range, 0-20.3 mm]; difference not significant). At follow-up, no significant differences were found between the PLLA and metal groups in terms of knee laxity measurements (median, 1.0 mm [range, -2.0-4.0 mm] vs 1.0 mm [range, -3.0-6.5 mm]), Tegner activity level (median, 7 [range, 3-9] vs 6 [range, 2-9]), or the Lysholm knee score (median, 90 points [range, 51-100] vs 89 points [range, 53-100]). The C-reactive protein values did not differ significantly between the 2 groups except for an increase in the PLLA group compared with the metal group at day 1 postoperatively -23 mg/L (range, <6-55) vs 9 mg/L (range,<6-55) (P < .001). Conclusion: There were significantly larger radiographically visible bone tunnels on the femoral side but not on the tibial side in the PLLA group compared with the metal group 8 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring tendon autografts.

Purpose: This study aimed to compare the outcomes of isolated ACL reconstruction using the patellar tendon (PT) autograft and the hamstring (HT) autograft in 180 patients over 20 years. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 180 participants undergoing isolated ACL reconstruction between 1993 and 1994 were prospectively recruited. Evaluation was performed at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years after surgery and included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee ligament evaluation with radiographic evaluation, KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference, and subjective scores. Results: Over 20 years, there were 16 patients (18%) and 9 patients (10%) with an ACL graft rupture in the HT and PT groups, respectively (P = .13). ACL graft rupture was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; P = .007), nonideal tunnel position (OR, 3.6; P = .019), and age <18 years at the time of surgery (OR, 4.6; P = .003). The odds of a contralateral ACL rupture were increased in patients with the PT graft compared with patients with the HT graft (OR, 2.2; P = .02) and those aged <18 years at the time of surgery (OR, 3.4; P = .001). The mean IKDC scores at 20-year follow-up were 86 and 89 for the PT and HT groups, respectively (P = .18).

Retaining the insertion may help to preserve vascularity and viability of the graft and bypass the stages of avascular necrosis and revascularization, which might be beneficial to graft maturity. Purpose: To investigate and compare graft maturity by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after ACL reconstruction with preservation or detachment of hamstring tendon tibial insertion at up to 2 years. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Forty-five patients (age range, 18-45 years) undergoing isolated ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon were enrolled and randomized to 2 groups. The tibial insertion of the hamstring tendon was preserved in the study group (n = 21) and detached in the control group (n = 24). Patients had follow-up at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, which consisted of the following: (1) clinical examination and (2) MRI evaluation of graft signal intensity based on signal/noise quotient (SNQ) values. Finally, 18 patients in the study group and 19 in the control group received full follow-up evaluation (ie, at all 4 time points). Results: All knees acquired full range of motion at 24 months without significant laxity. At each time point, the KT-1000 arthrometer revealed no significant difference between groups; the clinical scores significantly improved in both groups, although the difference between groups was not significant. In the control group, the SNQ value increased from 3 months, peaked at 6 months, and then decreased (3 months, 21.4 +/- 12.7; 6 months, 25.6 +/- 12; 12 months, 18.3 +/- 7.7; 24 months, 15.3 +/- 6.3).

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of the PLLA-HA screw versus titanium screw for hamstring tendon ACLR over a 5-year follow-up period. The hypothesis was that there are no differences in clinical scores or tunnel widening between the PLLA-HA and the titanium screws and that the PLLA-HA screw as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should show high-grade resorption and ossification response over 5 years.

It remains unclear whether extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) can promote graft healing after ACLR. Purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic and graft maturation effects of ESWT in hamstring autograft ACLR. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Between May 18, 2019, and September 20, 2019, we randomly assigned 30 patients who met study inclusion criteria to 2 groups. Patients in the control group followed a 5-week advanced rehabilitation training program (30 minutes/session, 5 times/week) starting at 3 months postoperatively. In the ESWT group, together with the 5-week advanced rehabilitation training, radial ESWT was applied once a week for 5 weeks. Functional scores (Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee, and Tegner scores), KT-1000 arthrometer knee laxity measurement, and magnetic resonance imaging scans were assessed at 3 months (baseline), 6 months, and 24 months postoperatively. To evaluate graft maturation, we assessed the graft signal-to-noise quotients (SNQs) of the tibial, intra-articular, and femoral sides on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Data were compared between the ESWT and control groups. Results: In total, 26 patients (13 with ESWT, 13 controls) were assessed. There were no significant between-group differences on any assessment at baseline, and no significant within-group or between-group differences were found in knee laxity at any point. At 24-month follow-up, the ESWT group had significantly higher Lysholm and Tegner scores compared with the controls (P = .012 and .017, respectively). Regarding graft maturation, at 6-month follow-up, the SNQ of the tibial intraosseous graft was significantly lower in the ESWT group versus controls (P = .006), but no differences were detected at the femoral intraosseous graft (P = .321) or the intra-articular graft (P = .314). At 24-month follow-up, the SNQs of the femoral intraosseous graft and intra-articular graft were significantly lower in the ESWT group versus controls (P = .020 and .044, respectively) but no difference was found at the tibial intraosseous graft (P = .579).

Limited evidence is available regarding the most effective intervention to achieve symmetry after reconstruction with contralateral bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft. Purpose: To verify whether unilateral isotonic resistance exercise is more effective than bilateral exercise for obtaining postoperative functional and muscular strength symmetry between the donor limb and reconstructed limb for patients who received BPTB graft. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 88 patients were randomly divided into a control group (n = 44) and an intervention group (n = 44). All participants performed an 8-week exercise program starting at the beginning of the fourth postoperative month and were evaluated before and after the program. The control group performed bilateral exercises, and the intervention group performed unilateral exercises for the donor limb only (the limb with the greatest disability). The primary outcome was muscle strength (peak torque and hamstrings to quadriceps [H:Q] ratio), and the secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM; goniometry), KT-1000 arthrometer side-to-side difference in anteroposterior knee laxity, and objective (single-leg hop test) and subjective (Lysholm score) functionality. Results: Both groups improved significantly from before to after the exercise program. The improvements were significantly greater in the intervention group regarding peak torque, H:Q ratio, flexion ROM, single-leg hop test, and Lysholm score in the donor limb (P < .001 for all), and the improvements were significantly greater in the control group regarding peak torque and single-leg hop test in the reconstructed limb (P < .001 for both). Comparison between the groups showed significantly increased symmetry regarding peak torque, H:Q ratio, and single-leg hop test in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .001), with large effect sizes (>0.80) except for the H:Q ratio. Conclusion: Although postoperative, bilateral, isotonic resistance exercise provided better strength gains to the reconstructed limb, unilateral exercise was more effective in obtaining functional and muscle strength between-limb symmetry in patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with contralateral BPTB graft.

Purpose: To investigate the clinical outcomes and maturity of different segments using insertion-preserved and free hamstring tendon autografts up to 5 years after ACLR. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: 45 patients who underwent isolated ACLR with hamstring tendon autografts were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups. The study group had ACLR with IP-HT, whereas the control group had ACLR with FHT. The International Knee Documentation Committee and Tegner scores, Lysholm activity score, and KT-1000 arthrometer measurements were evaluated preoperatively and at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months postoperatively. Three-dimensional-reconstruction MRI examinations were performed at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months to evaluate the signal/noise quotient (SNQ) values of femoral tunnel graft, intra-articular graft, and tibial tunnel graft. Results: At 60 months, the SNQ values of the intra-articular and tunnel sections for the grafts in both groups showed no difference; the clinical outcomes were improved compared with before surgery (P< .001) and were similar in both groups. In the early stage, all graft segments in the IP-HT group had lower SNQ values than those of the FHT group. At 6 months, the entire graft in the FHT group and the femoral tunnel section in the IP-HT group had the maximum SNQ values, whereas the femoral tunnel graft had the highest SNQ value compared with intra-articular and tibial tunnel graft in each group. SNQ values of the intra-articular and tibial tunnel graft in the IP-HT group had no significant change within 60 months. Conclusion: All patients had similar clinical outcomes and graft maturity at 60 months postoperatively. The SNQ values and progressions varied at different graft sites and were highest for the femoral tunnel graft. All significantly changing SNQ values reached the maximum value at 6 months.

Purpose: To compare the outcomes, especially the long-term cumulative failure rate, of ACL reconstruction using either synthetics with remnant preservation or hamstring autografts (4-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendons). Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 133 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction (synthetics: n = 43; hamstring autografts: n = 90) between July 2004 and December 2007 were included. Questionnaires (Tegner activity scale, Lysholm knee scale, and International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] subjective form) were completed preoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years postoperatively. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was additionally applied at 10 years' follow-up. The physical examination was based on the 2000 IKDC form. The manual maximum side-to-side difference (KT-1000 arthrometer), single-hop test, thigh muscle atrophy, and joint degeneration (Kellgren and Lawrence classification) were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test (Mantel-Cox, 95% CI) were used to compare graft survivorship. Results: Ten years postoperatively, 111 patients were available, with 38 (88.4%) patients (mean age, 27.6 9.3 years; 28 men) with synthetics and 73 (81.1%) patients (mean age, 28.6 +/- 8.8 years; 64 men) with hamstring autografts. Among them, 104 patients (synthetics: n = 35 [81.4%]; hamstring autografts: n = 69 [76.7%]) completed subjective evaluations, and 89 patients (synthetics: n = 30 [69.8%]; hamstring autografts: n = 59 [65.6%]) completed objective evaluations. For hamstring autografts and synthetics, the cumulative failure rates were 8.2% and 7.9%, respectively, and the log-rank test demonstrated no significant difference between the 2 Kaplan-Meier survival curves (P = .910). At 6 months postoperatively, for hamstring autografts and synthetics, the mean Lysholm score was 83.0 +/- 7.8 and 88.1 +/- 7.5, respectively (P < .001); the mean IKDC score was 83.8 +/- 7.8 and 86.9 +/- 4.5, respectively (P = .036); and the mean Tegner score was 3.7 +/- 1.1 and 5.0 +/- 1.5, respectively (P < .001). At 1 year postoperatively, the mean Tegner score was 5.5 +/- 1.9 and 6.5 +/- 2.0, respectively (P = .011). No statistically significant difference was observed on other subjective evaluation findings, physical examination findings (overall IKDC grade A: 45.8% of hamstring autografts, 50.0% of synthetics), side-to-side difference (1.5 +/- 1.5 mm for synthetics, 2.4 +/- 2.1 mm for hamstring autografts), single-hop test findings (grade A: 84.7% of hamstring autografts, 93.3% of synthetics), grade A/B thigh muscle atrophy (88.1% of hamstring autografts, 93.3% of synthetics), ipsilateral radiographic osteoarthritis (55.9% of hamstring autografts, 50.0% of synthetics), and graft survivorship. Conclusion: In this prospective cohort study, primary ACL reconstruction using either synthetics with remnant preservation or hamstring autografts showed satisfactory outcomes, especially the long-term cumulative failure rate, at 10 years postoperatively.

In a double-blind randomized clinical study, 19 patients with an ACL tear underwent either ST (59) or ST/G (61) and observed for 1 year. Both patients and the final examiner were unaware as to the type of graft received. Patients were evaluated according to subjective criteria, functional assessment tests, knee isometric torques, knee laxity using KT-2000 and knee range of motion. The study included 21 (17.6 %) female and 99 (82.4 %) male patients with a mean age of 29.9 +/- A 7.8 in the ST group and 32.4 +/- A 6.3 in the ST/G group.

At the final visit, 86.9 % of ST group and 89.6 % of ST/G group had side-to-side difference of laxity < 3 mm (n.s.). Since anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadrupled ST is more technically demanding than doubled STG and with there being no difference in outcomes and complications, no compulsory advice should be made on the former technique.

Purpose/Hypotheses: The study objectives were to compare clinical, functional, patient-reported, and OA imaging outcomes between 2 different initial laxity-based graft tension cohorts and a matched uninjured control group as well as to evaluate the effects of laxity-based graft tension on OA development at 84-month follow-up. The 2 laxity-based tension protocols were (1) to restore normal anteroposterior (AP) laxity at the time of surgery relative to the contralateral uninjured knee (low-tension group) or (2) to overconstrain AP laxity by 2 mm relative to the contralateral uninjured knee (high-tension group). The hypotheses were that (1) the high-tension group would have improved outcomes and decreased OA compared with the low-tension group after 84 months, and (2) the outcomes for the high-tension group would be equivalent to those for an age-, sex-, race-, and activity-matched group of control participants with uninjured knees. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients had their ACLs reconstructed with either a bone-patellar tendon-bone or 4-stranded hamstring autograft, and outcomes were compared with a matched control group. Outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at 60 and 84 months postoperatively and included clinical (KT-1000 arthrometer AP laxity measurement and International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] examination score), functional (1-legged hop for distance and knee extensor torque), patient-reported (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], Short Form-36 [SF-36], and patient satisfaction survey), and OA imaging (measurement of joint space width [JSW], Osteoarthritis Research Society International [OARSI] radiographic score, and Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score [WORMS]) components. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to evaluate differences in outcomes between the treatment groups and the control group. Results: There were significant differences between the 2 tension groups in 1 of 5 KOOS subscales (sports and recreation; P = .04) and 2 of 8 SF-36 subscales (vitality, mental health; P < .04) at 84 and 60 months, respectively. Both tension groups scored significantly worse than the control group in the IKDC examination (P < .001), 1-legged hop (P .017), KOOS quality of life and symptoms subscales (P < .03), and OARSI radiographic score (P .02) at 84 months. The low-tension group performed significantly worse than the control group on the KOOS pain subscale (P = .03), SF-36 general health and social functioning (P < .04), OARSI radiographic score (P < .001), and WORMS (P = .001), while the high-tension group had statistically different results than the control group in AP knee laxity (P < .001), radiographic JSW (P = .003), and OARSI radiographic score (P = .02) as well as significantly more subsequent knee injuries (P = .02) at 84 months. Conclusion: The results do not support the hypotheses that the high-tension group would have improved outcomes when compared with the low-tension group after 84 months of healing or that the outcomes for the high-tension group would be equivalent to those for the matched control group. While there were minor differences in patient-reported outcomes between the 2 laxity-based tension groups, all other outcomes were similar.

In ACL reconstruction with gracilis and semitendinous tendons, a relevant problem is the tibial fixation of the graft. Preserving the tibial insertion of the hamstring can assure a stable fixation. Study design: Prospective nonrandomized clinical trial. Methods. 60 patients with chronic unilateral ACL disruption consecutively had a two-incision arthroscopically assisted ACL replacement with four-strand semitendinous and gracilis graft. The graft was left inserted at the tibial attachment and placed proximally in over the top (OTT) fixation. The free end of the graft, carried back to the tibia, was fixed out of the tibial tunnel on the insertion of the pes anserinus. Subjective evaluation was assessed by the Tegner Activity Scale. Objective data were collected following the IKDC form guidelines. Instrumental test was performed by measuring comparative side-to-side arthrometrical difference. Subjective, clinical, arthrometrical and X-ray investigation were taken six months and seven years after surgery. Results. Two patients had a complete traumatic rupture of the graft during sport activity while two subjects demonstrated atraumatic graft failure. IKDC overall scores improved significantly from six months to the final follow-up but differences between the subgroups were not significant over time. The knees rated stable by KT-2000 at six months were stable at seven, but the group rated 3 to 5 mm at six months showed a significant trend toward a greater translation. Return to sport was closely related to Tegner activity scale. A second surgery (four cases) did not affect the final result. Conclusions. Hamstring quadrupled graft is very useful to restore knee stability in ACL chronic insufficiency. The choice to place the graft in OTT fixation, leaving intact the tibial hamstring insertion, does not affect the overall outcome. In particular no patient had problems with the tibial fixation of the tendons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2005,58,4,,,,,303,311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000237710900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: A total of 56 participants were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and placed into two groups: HT or QT. The hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio was the primary end-point measured with a Genu-3 dynamometer. Peak torque, functional assessment (Lysholm knee scoring scale and Cincinnati Knee Rating System), and anteroposterior laxity (KT-20001m arthrometer) were also assessed. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: The results of the H/Q ratio analysis of the participants over time revealed significant differences at 60, 180, and 300 degrees/s at three, six, and 12 months of follow-up (60 degrees/s: F = 5.3, p = 0.005; 180 degrees/s: F = 5.5, p = 0.004; 300 degrees/s: F = 5.1, p = 0.005). Furthermore, they revealed significant differences at 60 degrees/s, 180 degrees/s, and 300 degrees/s in the participants over time for peak torque in the extensor muscle strength at three and six months of follow-up, with higher values in the hamstring tendon group but not at 12 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences in functional endpoints or arthrometer assessments at 24 months of follow-up. Conclusion: An ACLR with a QT graft showed similar functional results with a better isokinetic H/Q ratio compared to an ACLR with the HT at 12 months of follow-up in soccer players.

Recently, there has been renewed interest in repairing the ACL in selected patients with a proximally torn ligament. Repair of the ligament has (potential) advantages over reconstruction of the ligament such as decreased surgical morbidity, faster return of range of motion, and potentially decreased awareness of the knee. Studies comparing both treatments in a prospective randomized method are currently lacking. Methods: This study is a multicenter prospective block randomized controlled trial. A total of 74 patients with acute proximal isolated ACL tears will be assigned in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either (I) ACL repair using cortical button fixation and additional suture augmentation or (II) ACL reconstruction using an all-inside autologous hamstring graft technique. The primary objective is to assess if ACL repair is non-inferior to ACL reconstruction regarding the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at two-years postoperatively. The secondary objectives are to assess if ACL repair is non-inferior with regards to (I) other patient-reported outcomes measures (i.e. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm score, Forgotten Joint Score, patient satisfaction and pain), (II) objective outcome measures (i.e. failure of repair or graft defined as rerupture or symptomatic instability, reoperation, contralateral injury, and stability using the objective IKDC score and Rollimeter/KT-2000), (III) return to sports assessed by Tegner activity score and the ACL-Return to Sports Index at two-year follow-up, and (IV) long-term osteoarthritis at 10-year follow-up. Discussion: Over the last decade there has been a resurgence of interest in repair of proximally torn ACLs. Several cohort studies have shown encouraging short-term and mid-term results using these techniques, but prospective randomized studies are lacking. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial has been designed to assess whether ACL repair is at least equivalent to the current gold standard of ACL reconstruction in both subjective and objective outcome scores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 30,2021,22,1,,,,,,,399,10.1186/s12891-021-04280-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12891-021-04280-y,,,,,,,,33931067,,,,,WOS:000645904900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Purpose:To evaluate the timing and rate of return for knee range of motion (ROM), stability, strength, and subjective scores after ACL reconstruction with contralateral patellar tendon graft (PTG). Study Design:Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods:Included were 2148 patients (1238 male patients, 910 female patients) who underwent primary ACL reconstruction with a contralateral PTG between 1995 and 2017 and had complete objective data through 3 months of follow-up. All patients participated in a rehabilitation program specific to goals for each knee.

ACL-QOL scores increased significantly from baseline for all groups (p < 0.0001), but mean scores at 5 years did not differ among the groups (p = 0.548): mean (and standard deviation) of 82.5 +/- 17.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.0 to 86.0) for patellar tendon, 83.9 +/- 18.2 (95% CI, 80.3 to 87.4) for hamstring tendon, and 81.1 +/- 19.3 (95% CI, 77.4 to 84.8) for double-bundle. The proportions of patients at 5 years with a pivot shift grade of >= 2 (12% for patellar tendon, 16% for hamstring tendon, and 22% for double-bundle; p = 0.149) and with normal and nearly normal knees per IKDC grade (87%, 82%, and 75% for the 3 groups, respectively; p = 0.093) trended in favor of patellar tendon reconstruction. No differences were seen for the IKDC subjective scores, knee range of motion including passive extension deficits, the single leg hop test, Cincinnati Occupational Rating scores, and Tegner activity levels. Kneeling pain was more common with patellar tendon reconstruction (10% of patients compared with 4% for hamstring tendon and 2% for double-bundle; p = 0.029). For hamstring tendon and double-bundle reconstructions, there were trends toward more complete traumatic reruptures (4% for patellar tendon, 10% for hamstring tendon, and 10% for double-bundle; p = 0.145) and partial traumatic tears (0%, 5%, and 6%, respectively; p = 0.059), with significantly fewer combined traumatic reinjuries in the patellar tendon group (4 patients compared with 16 for hamstring tendon and 17 for double-bundle; p = 0.010). Atraumatic graft failure (pivot shift grade of >= 2) was found for 10% of the patients. Conclusions: At 5 years, we found no significant difference in the quality-of-life outcome among the patellar tendon, hamstring tendon, and double-bundle techniques for ACL reconstruction. Significantly more patients in the hamstring tendon and double-bundle groups experienced traumatic graft reinjury compared with the patellar tendon group. There was a trend toward a higher percentage with normal and nearly normal IKDC grades in the patellar tendon group compared with hamstring tendon and double-bundle groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 5,2019,101,11,,,,,949,960,,10.2106/JBJS.18.01322,http://dx.doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.18.01322,,,,,,,,31169571,,,,,WOS:000474366000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, concern exists regarding the potential for lengthening under cyclical loads. Purpose: To compare the residual anterior laxity of 2 methods of femoral fixation, ALSF versus interference screw fixation, in patients undergoing isolated ACLR in the absence of meniscal injuries. To determine the preoperative risk factors associated with residual postoperative anterior laxity. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed comparing 2 groups of patients that underwent primary ACLR using ALSF versus bioabsorbable interference screw fixation. Anterior knee laxity was assessed with Telos stress radiography, while functional outcomes were evaluated with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Tegner activity level scale at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with residual postoperative laxity >3 mm. Results: Of the 1136 patients who underwent ACLR during the study period, 363 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 272 patients (75%) (mean age, 31.7 +/- 10.7 years) with a mean follow-up of 25.7 +/- 4.6 months (range, 24-36 months) consented to participate (screw group: n = 121; ALSF group: n = 151). The 2 groups were statistically comparable in terms of age, sex ratio, time from injury to surgery, graft diameter, preoperative laxity, preoperative objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade, and preoperative Tegner score. The mean postoperative laxity as a continuous variable was significantly different comparing the ALSF and screw groups (1.49 +/- 1.98 mm and 2.32 +/- 1.97 mm, respectively; P < .001). In the screw group, 76 patients (62.8%) had normal (<3 mm), 40 (33.1%) had nearly normal (3-6 mm), and 5 (4.1%) had abnormal (>= 6 mm) postoperative knee laxity according to the IKDC grade, while in the ALSF group, 112 patients (74.2%) had normal, 37 (24.5%) had nearly normal, and 2 (1.3%) had abnormal laxity (P = .0833). No significant difference was found in KOOS or Tegner scores comparing the 2 femoral fixation methods: KOOS, 90.6 +/- 7.5 (ALSF group) and 90.6 +/- 7.4 (screw group) (P = .7631), versus Tegner, 6.5 +/- 1.3 (ALSF group) and 6.3 +/- 1.4 (screw group) (P = .2992). A negative correlation was found between postoperative laxity and final Tegner (r(s) = -0.303, P < .001) and KOOS scores (r(s) = -0.168, P = .005). The initial univariate analysis showed differences between groups of patients with residual knee laxity >= 3 mm and <3 mm on preoperative pivot shift, preoperative laxity, age, fixation type, and preoperative objective IKDC grade. The multivariate analysis on these factors showed that the pivot shift remained the only significant predictor for residual laxity >= 3 mm for pivot shift grade 2 compared with grade 1 (odds ratio, 4.689 [95% CI, 2.465-9.286]) and for pivot shift grade 3 compared with grade 1 (odds ratio, 58.025 [95% CI, 12.757-557.741]) (P < .001). Conclusion: For primary ACLR, the use of an ALSF device for femoral fixation is associated with noninferior postoperative anterior knee laxity results compared with interference screw fixation at a minimum 2 years' follow-up. The preoperative pivot shift is the only significant risk factor for postoperative residual anterior knee laxity >3 mm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2018,46,10,,,,,2366,2375,,10.1177/0363546518784005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546518784005,,,,,,,,30015501,,,,,WOS:000440439000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Purpose: To determine if modified iliotibial band tenodesis (MITBT) can improve clinical outcomes and reduce the recurrence of ACL ruptures when added to ACL reconstruction in patients with a residual pivot shift. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Patients with a primary ACL rupture satisfying the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: first ACL rupture, involved in pivoting sports, skeletally mature, no meniscal repair performed, and residual pivot shift relative to the contralateral uninjured knee immediately after ACL reconstruction. Patients were randomized to group A (no further surgery) or group B (MITBT added) and were followed up for 2 years. The patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures used were the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscale of sport/recreation (Sport/Rec), KOOS subscale of quality of life (QoL), Lysholm knee score (LKS), Tegner activity scale (TAS), recurrent ACL ruptures, or need for further surgery in either knee. Analysis of variance was used to compare PROs; the Wilcoxon test was used for the TAS; and the chi-square test was used for recurrence of ACL ruptures, meniscal injuries, and contralateral ACL ruptures (P < .05). Results: A total of 55 patients were randomized: 27 to group A (female:male ratio = 15:12; mean age, 22.3 +/- 3.7 years) and 28 to group B (female:male ratio = 17:11; mean age, 21.8 +/- 4.1 years). At 2-year follow-up, group A had a similar IKDC score (90.9 +/- 10.7 vs 94.2 +/- 11.2; respectively; P = .21), lower KOOS Sport/Rec score (91.5 +/- 6.4 vs 95.3 +/- 4.4, respectively; P = .02), similar KOOS QoL score (92.0 +/- 4.8 vs 95.1 +/- 4.3, respectively; P = .14), lower LKS score (92.5 +/- 4.8 vs 96.8 +/- 8.0, respectively; P = .004), lower TAS score (median, 7 [range, 7-9] vs 8 [range, 8-10], respectively; P = .03), higher rate of recurrence (14.8% vs 0.0%, respectively; P < .001), similar rate of meniscal tears (14.8% vs 3.6%, respectively; P = .14), and similar rate of contralateral ACL ruptures (3.7% vs 3.6%, respectively; P = .99) relative to group B. Conclusion: The augmentation of ACL reconstruction with MITBT reduced the risk of recurrent ACL ruptures in knees with a residual pivot shift after ACL reconstruction and improved KOOS Sport/Rec, LKS, and TAS scores.

There was a 2-year minimum follow-up. From January to December 2009, an ACL 4-tunnel, anatomic, double-bundle reconstruction was performed on 27 patients. Double-strand hamstring tendon grafts were used in each femoral tunnel as well as two interference screws. Tibial fixation was insured through manual tension, by tying non-absorbable sutures on the bone bridge between the two tunnels at 20A degrees of knee flexion. Clinical assessments included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm knee scores, range of motion (ROM), pivot-shift test, single-leg hop, and quadriceps-hamstrings strength tests using a hand-held dynamometer. Anterior knee laxity was also assessed using a rolimeter. A single examiner performed all testing pre-operatively at 6 months and during the 2-year follow-up. All patients were assessed during the 2-year follow-up. At that time, 92 % of the patients presented normal anterior laxity (average, 1.3 +/- 0.5 mm) and rotational knee stability. No statistical side-to-side difference was found for ROM, muscle strength, single-leg hop, and function (n.s.). All patients presented a normal knee function according to the IKDC and the Lysholm score. In addition, no infection, graft failure, or pain were observed at the harvesting site.

Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in outcomes after 4-strand hamstring and patellar tendon autograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions using similar fixation techniques. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Between August 2000 and May 2003, 64 Keller Army Hospital patients with complete anterior cruciate ligament tears were randomized to hamstring (n = 32) or patellar tendon (n = 32) autograft anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Operative graft fixation and rehabilitative techniques were the same for both groups. Follow-up assessments included the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Postoperative radiographs were analyzed for tunnel location and orientation. Results: Eleven women and 53 men were randomized. Eighty-three percent of the patients (53 of 64) had follow-up of greater than 2 years, or to the point of graft rupture or removal (average follow-up, 36 months). Four hamstring grafts (12.5%) and three patellar tendon grafts (9.4%) (P=.71) ruptured. One deep infection in a hamstring graft patient necessitated graft removal. Forty-five of the 56 patients with intact grafts had greater than 2-year follow-up. Patients with patellar tendon grafts had greater Tegner activity scores (P=.04).

In cases involving complete tears, ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgery is the only way to restore the ligament's integrity. When selecting a graft, both the potential complications and the mechanical properties and healing efficacies should be considered. Artificial ligaments have been widely applied in clinical ACLR, and most have exhibited satisfactory biocompatibility and short-term follow-up results. Compared with autografts and allografts, however, the lack of bioactivity of currently available artificial ligaments is a major disadvantage. In addition, some long-term follow-up results have revealed other drawbacks of artificial ligaments, such as graft failure and other complications. Here, we summarize attempts to enhance the bioactive performance of artificial ligaments, as such modifications may have good potential for clinical translation and could improve the long-term outcomes of existing products.

A total of 75 patients (25 in each group) were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 25 months. Laxity was assessed pre- and post-operatively with Telos (TM) stress radiographs (15 kg). The amount of anterior tibial translation (ATT) corrected by the surgery was quantified. Secondary outcomes were International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, pivot shift grading, pain complaints, sensory deficits, subsequent surgical procedures, return to sports and patients' ability to kneel or squat on their affected knee. Absolute correction of ATT for the internal compartment was not statistically significant [analysis of variance (ANOVA), p = 0.377]. For the external compartment BPTB + L (8.2 mm) showed superiority over DBH (5.6 mm) and BPTB (4.1 mm) (ANOVA, p = 0.0001, Tukey's test). Kneeling was better in the DBH group (ANOVA, p = 0.0001, Tukey's test). In 22 patients it felt normal, while only in seven in the BPTB and eight in the BPTB + L groups.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The prospective study included a total of 119 patients (74 men/39 women) with the mean age of 28.3 (18-52) years, in whom demographic data was collected and a clinical examination was performed. The patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study and subsequently underwent the same, aforementioned surgical procedure performed by a single surgeon. Preoperatively and at a minimum 12-month follow-up the following subjective criteria were evaluated using the Lysholm and IKDC subjective scores and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0-10). The objective parameters comprised the side-to-side difference in anterior knee laxity assessed by Genourob arthrometer with an applied pressure of 134 and 250 N, anterior drawer test, and the pivot shift test. The occurrence of graft failure, complications and return to pre-injury sport levels were monitored. The obtained data was statistically evaluated at the statistical significance level of 0.05. RESULTS A total of 89 patients were assessed at the follow-up of at least 12 months after the surgery. The median Lysholm score increased over time from 58.7 preoperatively to 94.2 postoperatively (p < 0.05) and the IKDC subjective score went up from 46.3 to 91.4 (p < 0.05). The median postoperative VAS kept decreasing from 7.3 (Day 2), 5.1 (Day 14), 3.1 (Week 6), 1.2 (Month 6) to 0.3 at 12 months after the surgical procedure. Preoperatively, the results were significantly positive (i.e. C, D) in 52.8% (C) and 21.4% (D), whereas postoperatively the results of the PST were significantly positive only in 4%. Therefore, the surgical procedure was conducive to a statistically significant decrease in rotational knee laxity over time (p < 0.05). The median side-to-side difference in anterior laxity of the operated knee objectively assessed by GNRB arthrometer with the applied pressure of 134 N was 4.2 mm (3.1-6.8) as against the postoperative 1.2 mm (0.4-2.1) and with the applied pressure of 250 N it was 6.2 mm (4.6-8.7) prior to the surgical procedure versus 2.4 mm (1.6-3.5) postoperatively. That concerned a statistically significant decrease of postoperative side-to-side difference in anterior laxity of the operated knee at both the measured pressures (p < 0.05).The graft failed in 3 patients only (3.4%), no major complications associated with the surgical procedure were observed and 62 of the evaluated patients (69.6%) were able to return to the pre-injury level of sport within one year after the surgery. DISCUSSION When comparing the results obtained by our study with the conclusions of clinical studies carried out by other authors and evaluating similar clinical parameters with the identical surgical technique applied, it is obvious that in our group of patients we achieved similar clinical results as the other authors from abroad. CONCLUSIONS The results of our study showed that the all-inside ACL anatomical reconstruction using quadrupled semitendinosus tendon graft with posteromedial harvest with suspensory fixation by Tightrope implants at one year after the surgery bring very good subjective as well as objective clinical results and minimum complications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2018,85,2,,,,,94,101,,,,,,,,,,,30295594,,,,,WOS:000431090500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hypothesis: The choice of graft material (patellar tendon or hamstring tendon) does affect clinical outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Prospective, nontrandomized clinical trial. Methods: Two groups of 90 patients each were followed for a minimum of 5 years. Results: International Knee Documentation Committee assessment revealed that more than 85% of each group had an overall score of A or B at all follow-up intervals. The median Lysholm knee score was greater than 90 for both groups at 2 and 5 years. Instrumented testing revealed no significant difference between the two groups beyond 3 years. Thirty-one percent of the patellar tendon group (25) had a fixed flexion deformity and 19% of the hamstring tendon group (14) had fixed flexion deformity at 5 years. Radiologic assessment revealed early osteoarthritic changes in 4% of the hamstring tendon group (2) and in 18% of the patellar tendon group (11) at 5 years.

Treatment for acute anterior cruciate ligament tear: five year outcome of randomised trial. BMJ. 2013;346:F232. Clinical Question: Does early anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with rehabilitation lead to better patientreported outcomes and a lower incidence of osteoarthritis at 5 years postinjury compared with delayed ACL reconstruction with rehabilitation? Study Selection: This randomized controlled trial with extended follow-up at 5 years postrandomization was conducted in 2 Swedish orthopaedic departments. Data Extraction: The authors studied a total of 121 moderately active adults (age = 18-35 years) with an acute ACL rupture in a knee with no other history of trauma. Excluded were patients with a collateral ligament rupture, full-thickness cartilage defect, or extensive meniscal fixation. One patient assigned to the early ACL-reconstruction group did not attend the 5-year follow-up visit. Patients were randomly assigned to (1) an early ACL reconstruction plus structured rehabilitation group (n = 62, surgery within 10 weeks of injury) or (2) optionaldelayed ACL reconstruction plus structured rehabilitation group (n = 59). The primary outcome measure was change in the average of 4 out of 5 subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The authors also assessed crude KOOS (combined 4 subscales), KOOS subscale scores, general physical and mental health (Short-Form 36), activity level (Tegner Activity Scale), mechanical knee stability (Lachman and pivot shift tests), meniscal surgery status, and presence of knee osteoarthritis on radiographs. Main Results: Among patients randomized to the optionaldelayed ACL-reconstruction group, 30 (51%) opted for an ACL reconstruction. The treatment groups had comparable 5-year patient-reported outcomes and changes in patient-reported outcomes (eg, knee pain, knee symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreational levels, knee-related quality of life, general physical health, and general mental health). Patients in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group had greater mechanical knee instability than patients who received early ACL reconstruction; however, this was primarily among the patients opting for conservative management alone. In the overall sample, 61 knees (51%) required meniscal surgery over 5 years, regardless of treatment group. At 5 years, radiographs were available for 113 patients (93%). Overall, 29 patients (26%) had knee osteoarthritis at 5 years. Specifically, 13 patients (12%) developed tibiofemoral radiographic osteoarthritis (9 patients [16%] in the early ACL-reconstruction group, 4 [7%] in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group) and 22 (19%) developed patellofemoral osteoarthritis (14 patients [24%] in the early ACL-reconstruction group, 8 [15%] in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group). Patients with patellar tendon grafts (n = 40) had a greater incidence of ipsilateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis than patients with hamstrings tendon grafts (n = 51), but the 2 groups had similar incidences of ipsilateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. Six knees (5%) had both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Conclusions: Early ACL reconstruction plus rehabilitation did not provide better results at 5 years compared with optionaldelayed ACL reconstruction plus rehabilitation. Furthermore, the authors found no radiographic differences among patients with early ACL reconstruction, delayed ACL reconstruction, or no ACL reconstruction (rehabilitation alone).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2015,50,1,,,,,110,112,,10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.53,http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.53,,,,,,,,25322347,,,,,WOS:000352270300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, no existing clinical studies show adequate support for the choice of one graft over the other. Hypothesis: Hamstring tendons are equally as good as patellar tendon in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. Study Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial. Methods: Ninety-nine patients with laxity caused by a torn anterior cruciate ligament underwent arthroscopically assisted reconstruction with graft randomization according to their birth year. Grafts were either bone-patellar tendon-bone with metal interference screw fixation or double-looped hamstring tendons with metal plate fixation. There were no significant differences between the two groups preoperatively or at operation. Standard rehabilitation included immediate postoperative mobilization without a knee brace, protected weightbearing for 2 weeks, and return to full activity at 6 to 12 months. Results: Forty-three patients in the patellar tendon group and 46 patients in the hamstring tendon group were available for clinical evaluation at a minimum of 21 months after surgery.

Methods: Long-term follow-up of 164 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury randomized to arthroscopic reconstruction with a quadrupled semitendinosus graft or a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was undertaken. After a mean 8 years, 153 patients were available for follow-up, including instrumented laxity, 1-legged hop test, a knee-walking test, and assessment with International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, Tegner, and patellofemoral pain score. Health-related quality of life was assessed with Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and Short Form-36. Results: Patients in both graft groups retained the same stability, knee function, and health-related quality of life. The patellofemoral pain score was similar for both groups; the bone-patellar tendon-bone group had more donor site morbidity from kneeling and knee walking. In the bone-patellar tendon-bone group, 19 patients had no kneeling problems, 23 slight problems, 31 moderate problems, and 5 unable to kneel.

This study was conducted to determine the overall prevalence of osteoarthritis and to identify the risk factors after ACL reconstruction. Hypothesis: Meniscus tears, time from injury to surgery, body mass index (BMI), residual laxity, and cartilage lesions influence the progression towards osteoarthritis. Materials and methods: This multicenter, retrospective study on the outcome of cruciate ligaments at 12 years of follow-up was conducted within the 2014 SOFCOT Symposium. The cohort included 675 arthroscopic reconstructions of the ACL from January 2002 to December 2003. The clinical evaluation included the objective and subjective IKDC score. Osteoarthritis was analyzed on 589 knee X-rays according to the IKDC classification. The predictive factors of osteoarthritis development studied were age, gender, BMI, time from injury to surgery, activity level, medial or lateral meniscectomy, type of graft, medial or lateral chondropathy, tunnel positioning, and residual laxity. Univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed. Results: The mean follow-up was 11.9 +/- 0.8 years. The subjective IKDC score was 83.7 +/- 13. At 12 years, the rate of moderate to severe osteoarthritis 1 (IKIX C or D) was 19% (16% medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, 4% lateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, and 2% patellofemoral osteoarthritis). The prognostic factors were age at surgery greater than 34 years (P<0.05), cartilage lesions at surgery (P<0.05), medial or lateral meniscectomy (P < 0.05), and residual laxity (A < 0.05). Conclusions: This large-scale study identified risk factors for osteoarthritis that should improve the information provided to patients on long-term progression after ACL reconstruction.

MethodsThis study was a single center, randomized controlled trial. Seventy-three subjects with ACL rupture were enrolled. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups, 47 in the experimental group (Group A) and 26 in the control group (Group B). All operations were performed under FNB. In Group A, 10 ml of 1% ropivacaine was injected precisely at the hamstring donor site. Patients in Group B were treated with the same amount of saline. Preoperatively and postoperatively, pain scores based on the numerical rating scale (NRS) and consumption of opioids were recorded. In addition, knee functions were assessed by the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), the Lysholm score, and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 and 3 months. In addition, we applied the KNEELAX3 arthrometer to evaluate the stability of the knee preoperatively and postoperatively so that subjective and objective knee conditions were obtained to help us assess knee recovery in a comprehensive manner. ResultsThe hamstring donor-site block reduced pain within the first 12 postoperative hours. There were no significant differences between two groups in pain intensity preoperatively and equal to or greater than 24 hours postoperatively. Furthermore, there were no differences between the groups concerning knee functions preoperatively or in the short-term follow-up at 1 and 3 months.

Five-Year Results of a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: High-level evidence for short-term outcomes of contemporary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) suture repair (ACLSR) in comparison with those of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is scarce. High-level evidence for mid- and long-term results is lacking, whereas outcomes of ACLSR in several historical studies were shown to deteriorate at midterm follow-up after initial good short-term outcomes. Hypothesis: Contemporary ACLSR is noninferior to ACLR in the treatment of acute ACL rupture in terms of patient self-reported outcomes at 5 years postoperatively. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 48 patients were enrolled in the study and, after stratification and randomization, underwent either dynamic augmented (DA) ACLSR or anatomic single-bundle ACLR. The primary outcome measure was the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 (IKDC) subjective score (IKDCs). Furthermore, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner Activity Scale score (TAS), visual analog scale score for satisfaction (VASs), IKDC physical examination score (IKDCpe), limb symmetry index for quadriceps (LSIq) and hamstrings (LSIh) strength and jump test battery (LSIj), Kellgren-Lawrence grade of osteoarthritis (OA), and rate of adverse events were recorded. Analyses were based on an intention-to-treat principle. Results: The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the median IKDCs of the DA ACLSR group (n = 23; 75.9) was lower than the prespecified noninferiority margin (n = 21; 86.6). Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. However, the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the DA ACLSR group (100.0) was higher than the median IKDCs of the ACLR group (96.6), rendering the result for noninferiority inconclusive. No statistical difference was found between groups for median IKDCs (repair, 90.2; reconstruction, 96.6). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were found for any of the secondary outcome measures for the DA ACLSR compared with the ACLR group: KOOS Symptoms, 92.9 versus 96.4; KOOS Pain, 100 versus 97.2; KOOS Activities of Daily Living, 100 versus 100; KOOS Sport and Recreation, 85.0 versus 100; TAS score, 7.0 versus 6.5; VASs, 9.2 versus 8.7; IKDCpe, 81.8% versus 100%; LSIq, >= 91.6 versus >= 88.2; LSIh, >= 95.1 versus >= 90.7; LSIj, >= 94.2 versus >= 97.6; OA grade 0, 90.9% versus 77.8%; clinical ACL failure rate, 20.8% versus 27.2%; and repeat surgery rate, 37.5% versus 20.0%, respectively. Conclusion: It remains inconclusive whether the effectiveness of DA ACLSR is noninferior to that of ACLR in terms of subjective patient-reported outcomes as measured using the IKDCs.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in hamstring co-contraction during the early postoperative stages. Design Twenty-five patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were followed up for 1-3 mos postoperatively, during which the Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaires were completed and surface electromyograms were assessed during terminal knee extension maximum voluntary contraction and step-up tests. The integrated electromyogram of the tested muscles and co-contraction ratio were analyzed. Results Co-contraction ratio during terminal knee extension maximum voluntary contraction at 3 mos postoperatively was significantly less than that at 1 mo postoperatively (P < 0.0083), and it did not significantly differ from that of the uninvolved knee. In contrast, the co-contraction ratio during step-up was significantly higher at 2 and 3 mos postoperatively than that before surgery (P < 0.0167) and for the uninvolved knee (P < 0.05). Moreover, the postoperative hamstring co-contraction ratio in patients with a chronic injury was significantly higher during the step-up test than in patients with an early injury (P = 0.017). Conclusions Hamstring co-contraction ratio during terminal knee extension maximum voluntary contraction recovers during the early postoperative stages. However, hamstring co-contraction ratio during step-up, which may be related to knee joint proprioception, remains high, particularly for patients with a chronic injury.

Graft choice has shown to have an influence on postoperative outcomes after ACL-R. While patient reported outcomes measurements do not differ between graft options, evidence shows that normal knee kinematics is not fully restored after ACL-R with an increase in postoperative anterior tibial translation (ATT). Postoperative graft rupture rates seem to favor bone-patella-tendon-bone (BPTB) and quadriceps tendon (QT) autografts over HT or allografts.

Methods: Thirty male patients (mean age: 28.1 years) with ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) an experimental group to receive a KT treatment through the muscle and lymphatic correction techniques; or (2) a control group for sham KT. Both interventions were applied twice during a 10-day period from the fourth postoperative day. All patients received the same rehabilitation program for three months. The groups were compared according to range of motion (ROM), pain, swelling and muscle strength before treatment and on the fifth and tenth treatment days. Subjective evaluations were made with the Lysholm, modified Cincinnati and Tegner scores on the first and third postoperative months. Results: Intragroup comparisons showed significant improvements in both groups on the fifth and tenth day and first and third month evaluations (p < 0.05). In comparison to the control group, the experimental group showed significant improvements in swelling around the patella, all pain measurements and hamstring muscle strength on the fifth KT day and knee flexion range of motion (ROM), night pain, all swelling measurements and hamstring muscle strength on the tenth KT day (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results revealed that KT techniques applied in addition to the acute rehabilitation program of ACL reconstruction are beneficial in treatment of pain, swelling, knee flexion ROM, and hamstring muscle strength.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is a treatment that can counteract strength loss and serve as an adjunct to conventional therapy. Purpose: To compare the effect of adding traditional neuromuscular electrical stimulation (Polystim) or a novel garment-integrated neuromuscular electrical stimulation (Kneehab) to a standard postoperative rehabilitation program (control). Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Ninety-six patients, of a total enrolled cohort of 131 patients randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups, completed a standard rehabilitation program. In addition, the 2 neuromuscular electrical stimulation groups underwent 20-minute sessions of neuromuscular electrical stimulation 3 times a day, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks, in which stimulation was superimposed on isometric volitional contractions. Outcome measures including isokinetic strength of the knee extensors of the injured and uninjured leg at 90 and 180 deg/s, along with functional tests of proprioception, were assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months postoperatively. Results: The Kneehab group achieved significantly better results at each time point compared with the Polystim and control groups (P<.001). Extensor strength of the Kneehab group at speeds of 90 and 180 deg/s increased by 30.2% and 27.8%, respectively, between the preoperative measurements and the 6-month follow-up point in the injured leg. The corresponding changes for Polystim were 5.1% and 5%, whereas for the control group they were 6.6% and 6.7%, respectively. The mean single-legged hop test hop score of the Kneehab group improved by 50% between the 6-week and 6-month follow-up, whereas the corresponding changes for the Polystim and control groups were 26.3% and 26.2%, respectively.

Psychological and physiological factors may negatively affect patient recovery after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), and development of kinesiophobia is possible. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of kinesiophobia and lower-leg muscle strength recovery in both sexes after ACLR. Methods: 140 ACLR patients agreed to participate in the study. Kinesiophobia was assessed using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK). The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) were used for patient-related outcome measurements. In both legs quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength at 60 degrees/s degrees /s and 180 degrees/s degrees /s were measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. For dynamic balance and leg function, the Y-balance test and single-leg hop test were used. Results: 100 (71%) males and 40 (29%) females-mean age 32.5 (+8.3)-were examined 5.5 (+1.25) years after ACLR. 68/140 patients (48.6%) reported a TSK kinesiophobia score equal to or higher than 37 points: 54/100 (54%) males and 14/40 (35%) females (p = 0.04). Patients with kinesiophobia had significantly lower KOOS values (p < 0.001). In terms of the TAS no significant differences were found between those with or without kinesiophobia. Knee strength deficiency at 180 degrees/sec degrees /sec and 60 degrees/sec degrees /sec was significantly higher in the kinesiophobia group in knee extension in males (p = 0.009) and knee flexion in females (p = 0.001). Normalized body weight isokinetic average peak torque strength tests were significantly better in males compared to females in both groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Both sexes reported high rates of kinesiophobia, but males are at higher risk of developing kinesiophobia than females in the medium term after ACLR. Furthermore, patients with kinesiophobia have significantly lower total KOOS scores, and females were significantly weaker than males in knee flexion and extension according to normalized body weight muscle strength tests. Also, a longer time from injury to surgery increases the risk of kinesiophobia in females. Level of evidence: Level IV. Type of study: Retrospective case series study.

Neither of the 2 most common graft techniques-the patellar tendon (PT) or hamstring tendon (HS) graft-has demonstrated superiority in terms of the long-term osteoarthritis rate.

Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: All adults with a first ACL rupture who underwent surgery with a PT or HS graft technique between January 2002 and December 2003 were included in the 2014 French Society of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology Symposium database. Baseline characteristics were collected. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of moderate to severe osteoarthritis in each group. The secondary endpoints included clinical subjective evaluations by the IKDC score and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. To control the differences in baseline characteristics, the data were analyzed with propensity score matching. Results: In the cohort, 541 patients from 18 centers were included: 311 PT and 230 HS ACL reconstructions. The baseline characteristics were similar after inverse probability weighting treatment (IPWT). The occurrence of osteoarthritis was similar after IPWT (19.3% for PT and 19.6% for HS, P = .94). Age at surgery >29 years and IKDC osteoarthritis stage B at the index surgery were identified as risk factors for moderate to severe osteoarthritis. Most functional outcomes were significantly higher in the HS group; however, the difference between groups remained <10 points. Of the 106 patients who needed a medial meniscectomy, the proportion of patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis was much higher in the HS group (43.5% vs 18.3%, P = .006).

As hamstring tendon autografts are becoming more commonly used, a study examining the effect of contralateral graft harvest of semitendinosus gracilis (STG) tendons on patient quality of life was conducted. Purpose: To evaluate if ACLR using a hamstring tendon autograft results in better patient quality of life if the graft is harvested from the leg contralateral to the ACL rupture compared with the ipsilateral leg. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 100 participants between 16 and 50 years of age with a complete ACL tear were randomly assigned to undergo ACLR using either the ipsilateral or contralateral leg as the STG graft donor. Primary outcome measures were the ACL Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QOL), concentric knee flexion and extension strength at 60 and 240 deg/s, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, early postoperative pain and diary of analgesic use, and rate of reruptures. Outcome measures were evaluated before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Results: The ACL-QOL score improved over time for both groups (P < .001), and there were no significant differences between groups at any time point (P = .528). Significant differences in knee flexion and extension strength were found at 3 months after surgery. There were no differences between groups in IKDC knee assessment scores or rerupture rates. Conclusion: There does not appear to be any measurable benefit or drawback in quality of life to the use of an STG graft from the unaffected limb. In light of this finding, further research to examine other possible effects on agility and balance as well as time and ability to return to sport should be conducted.

Our aim was to investigate the effects of quadriceps tendon autograft (QTB) vs. semitendinosus-gracilis autograft (StG) on thigh muscle strength and functional capacity, and a patient-reported outcome 1 year after ACL-R, and to compare the results to healthy controls. Methods ACL-R patients (n = 100) and matched controls (CON, n = 50) were recruited, with patients being randomly assigned to QTB (n = 50) or StG (n = 50) ACL-R. One year after ACL-R, bilateral knee extensor (KE) and flexor (KF) muscle strength (isometric, dynamic, explosive, limb symmetry index [LSI], hamstring:quadriceps ratio [HQ ratio]) were assessed by isokinetic dynamometry, along with functional capacity (single leg hop distance [SHD]) and a patient-reported outcome (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] score). Results KE muscle strength of the operated leg was lower (9-11%) in QTB vs. StG as was KE LSI, while KF muscle strength was lower (12-17%) in StG vs. QTB as was KF LSI. HQ ratios were lower in StG vs. QTB. Compared with the controls, KE and KF muscle strength were lower in StG (10-22%), while KE muscle strength only was lower in QTB (16-25%). Muscle strength in the StG, QTB, and CON groups was identical in the non-operated leg. While SHD and IKDC did not differ between StG and QTB, SHD in both StG and QTB was lower than CON. The IKDC scores improved significantly 1 year following ACL-R for both graft types. Conclusion One year after ACL-R, muscle strength is affected by autograft type, with StG leading to impairments of KE and KF muscle strength, while QTB results in more pronounced impairments of KE only.

Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: The study included patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstring autografts using the same fixation method. All patients received the same analgesia and physical therapy (PT) protocol and were randomized to receive either the nutritional supplement (supplemented group) or no additional therapy (control group). Patients were followed up at days 7, 30, 60, and 90. Pain was assessed by use of a visual analog scale (VAS) and by analgesic consumption. Clinical outcome was assessed via International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and the number of PT sessions. Perceived efficacy and tolerability were rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Graft maturation was assessed by a blinded musculoskeletal radiologist using magnetic resonance imaging. The number of adverse events (AEs) was recorded. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis included 72 patients, 36 allocated to the supplemented group and 36 to the control group, with no significant differences regarding demographic and preoperative characteristics. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain and function (measured by VAS and IKDC scores) during the 90-day follow-up period (P < .001 for both), without significant differences between groups.

The objective was to compare outcomes between 2 commonly used laxity-based initial graft tension protocols. Hypotheses: (1) The high-tension group would have less knee laxity, improved clinical and patient-oriented outcomes, and less cartilage damage than would the low-tension group after 36 months of healing. (2) The outcomes of the high-tension group would be equivalent to those of a matched control group. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Ninety patients with isolated unilateral ACL injuries were randomized to undergo ACL reconstruction using 1 of 2 initial graft tension protocols: (1) autografts tensioned to restore normal anterior-posterior (AP) laxity at the time of surgery (ie, low tension; n = 46) and (2) autografts tensioned to overconstrain AP laxity by 2 mm (ie, high tension; n = 44). Sixty matched healthy patients formed the control group. Outcomes were assessed preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 6, 12, and 36 months after surgery. Results: No significant differences were found between the 2 initial graft tension protocols for any of the outcome measures at 36 months. However, there were differences when comparing the 2 treatment groups to the control group. On average, AP laxity was 2 mm greater in the ACL-reconstructed groups than in the control group (P < .007). International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee evaluation scores, peak isokinetic knee extension torques, and 4 of 5 Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were significantly worse than the control group (P < .001, P < .027, and P < .05, respectively). Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) scores and reinjury rates were similar between groups at 36 months. Although there were significant changes in radiography and magnetic resonance imaging present in the ACL-reconstructed knees of both treatment groups, the magnitude was relatively small and likely clinically insignificant at 36 months. Conclusion: Both laxity-based initial graft tension protocols produced similar outcomes without fully restoring joint function or patient-oriented outcomes (KOOS) when compared with the control group.

Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a novel thermoplastic polymer with high biocompatibility and mechanical properties that mimic native bone, and it can be imaged on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without signal flare. Purpose: To compare the clinical performance of ACL reconstruction with PEEK and titanium interference screws at 2 years and to evaluate a novel method of measuring tunnel volume. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 133 patients underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with 4-strand hamstring autografts and were randomized to have titanium or PEEK interference screws for femoral and tibial tunnel fixation. At 2 years, subjective Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores were assessed and clinical examination performed. At 12 months, MRI was performed to assess graft incorporation and cyst formation, and a novel technique was employed to measure tunnel volumes. Results: There were no significant differences in graft rerupture rate, contralateral ACL rupture rate, subjective outcomes, or objective outcomes. In the titanium and PEEK groups, MRI demonstrated high overall rates of graft integration (96%-100% and 90%-93%, respectively) and ligamentization (89% and 84%) and low rates of synovitis (22% and 10%) and cyst formation (0%-18% and 13%-15%). There was a higher proportion of patients with incomplete graft integration within the femoral tunnel in the PEEK group as compared with the titanium group (10% vs 0%, P = .03); however, the authors suggest that metal artifact precluded proper assessment of the graft in the titanium group by MRI. Tunnel volumes also appeared to be equivalent in the 2 groups and were measured with a novel technique that was highly reproducible in the PEEK group secondary to the absence of flare. Conclusion: Two-year clinical analysis of PEEK interference screws for femoral and tibial fixation of ACL reconstructions showed equivalent clinical performance to titanium interference screws. Given the excellent mechanical characteristics, biological compatibility, and absence of metal artifact on MRI, PEEK has become our material of choice for interference screw fixation in ACL reconstruction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,47,10,,,,,2386,2393,,10.1177/0363546519861530,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546519861530,,,,,,,,31306589,,,,,WOS:000478659700016,View Full Record in Web of Science

M.",,,Enhancing functional recovery after ACL injury. A protocol for a randomized control trial of transcranial direct current stimulation over the motor cortex,FRONTIERS IN REHABILITATION SCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Introduction Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common in athletic and nonathletic populations, often resulting from activities involving rapid directional changes that place stress on the knee. Although advances in surgery and rehabilitation have improved recovery, many patients still struggle to regain pre-injury performance and face increased risk of re-injury. We hypothesize that combining standard rehabilitation with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may accelerate recovery, improve neuromuscular control, and strengthen key muscles like the hamstrings and hip abductors, reducing reinjury risk. Methods/materials This randomized controlled trial protocol, approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Valencia, follows a double-blind, comparative, longitudinal design per SPIRIT guidelines. Elite athletes will be randomized 1:1 into two age- and sex-matched groups: non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) + rehabilitation (ProtocolRHB) or sham NIBS + ProtocolRHB. The NIBS intervention uses tDCS to deliver low-intensity direct current to modulate cortical excitability. Data collection spans April 2025 to December 2027 with outcomes assessed at four postsurgical time points. The primary outcome is electromyographic (EMG) activity to evaluate muscle activation, crucial for restoring knee stability and function. Secondary outcomes include knee function (Lysholm Scale) and ACL-specific quality of life. EEG and TMS will assess cortical excitability and plasticity during voluntary muscle contraction. Impact statement This study integrates neurophysiology with rehabilitation, offering a novel approach to enhance functional recovery and lower reinjury risk post-ACL reconstruction, potentially informing future evidence-based sports medicine and neurorehabilitation strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 16,2025,6,,,,,,,,1627228,10.3389/fresc.2025.1627228,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fresc.2025.1627228,,,,,,,,41180415,,,,,WOS:001605627700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Purpose/Hypothesis: This study sought to assess the effect of initial graft tension and patient sex on PTOA outcomes at 10 to 12 years after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The hypothesis was that there would be no group- or sex-based differences in outcomes. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients were randomized to receive ACLR with a low or high initial graft tension. Outcomes were evaluated at 10 to 12 years postoperatively and compared with a matched, uninjured control group. Outcomes included clinical assessments (anteroposterior [AP] knee laxity measurement, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] examination score), a functional assessment (single-leg hop for distance), patient-reported outcomes (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Tegner activity level, patient satisfaction), and PTOA imaging (Osteoarthritis Research Society International [OARSI] radiographic score and Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score [WORMS]). Two-way mixed-model analyses of variance were used to evaluate differences in outcomes between tension groups and the control group and between female and male patients. Results: Both tension groups scored worse than the control group for the IKDC examination (P <= .021), KOOS (Pain, Activities of Daily Living, Sport/Recreation, and Quality of Life subscales) (P <= .049), and WORMS difference score (P <= .042). The low-tension group scored worse than the control group for KOOS Symptoms (P = .016) and the OARSI difference score (P = .015). The index limb had worse scores than the contralateral limb within the high-tension group for AP laxity (P = .030) and hop deficit (P = .011). This result was also observed within both tension groups for the WORMS (P <= .050) and within the low-tension group for the OARSI score (P = .001). Male patients had higher Tegner scores (mean +/- SE) relative to female patients (male, 5.49 +/- 1.88; female, 4.45 +/- 1.65) and worse OARSI difference scores (male, 1.89 +/- 5.38; female, 0.244 +/- 0.668) (P = .007 and .034, respectively). However, no significant differences were detected between tension groups for any of the outcomes measured. Conclusion: Overall, ACLR failed to prevent PTOA regardless of initial graft tension. However, male patients treated with a low initial graft tension may be at greater risk for PTOA.

This study aimed to compare graft healing using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional clinical outcome scores in a matched cohort of patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with hamstring autografts with or without periosteal augmentation. Material and methods Forty-eight patients who underwent ACL reconstruction (ACLR) were prospectively enrolled: 25 with standard ACLR (ST-ACLR) and 23 with periosteal augmented grafts (PA-ACLR). The same surgical techniques, fixation methods, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. Signal-to-noise quotient (SNQ), graft healing at the bone-graft interface, graft signal according to the Howell scale, and femoral tunnel widening were evaluated using MRI after 1 year of follow-up. International knee documentation score (IKDC), Lysholm, Tegner activity scale, and visual analog scale for pain were used for functional evaluation at a minimum of 2 years postoperative. Results The mean SNQ of the proximal part of the graft was 9.6 +/- 9.2 and 2.9 +/- 3.3 for the ST-ACLR and PA-ACLR groups, respectively (P = 0.005). The mean femoral tunnel widening was 30.3% +/- 18.3 and 2.3% +/- 9.9 for the ST-ACLR, PA-ACLR groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Complete graft tunnel healing was observed in 65% and 28% of cases in the PA-ACLR and ST-ACLR groups, respectively. Both groups showed marked improvements in functional scores, with no statistically significant differences. Conclusion Periosteal wrapping of hamstring tendon autografts is associated with better graft healing and maturation and lower incidence of femoral tunnel widening based on MRI analysis 1 year after ACL reconstruction.

Recently, the popularity of lateral extra-articular procedures has resurged, warranting an urgent evaluation of their safety profile. Purpose/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to perform an interim analysis of the ongoing SANTI randomized controlled trial to determine whether combined ACL and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ACL + ALLR) is associated with an increased rate of adverse outcomes when compared with isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The hypothesis was that there would be no significant difference between groups at a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Recruitment commenced in November 2016. Patients scheduled for ACLR were randomized to either isolated ACLR (with bone-patellar tendon-bone [BPTB] autograft) or combined ACL + ALLR (with hamstring tendon autograft). All patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year by March 2019 were included. The evaluated parameters included complications and reoperations, knee laxity parameters, range of motion, and scores on the Tegner, Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) instruments. Results: A total of 224 patients (112 in each group) with a mean +/- SD follow-up of 12.3 +/- 1.9 months (range, 12-19 months) formed the study population. A significantly higher rate of reoperation for cyclops syndrome was noted in the isolated ACLR group compared with the combined ACL + ALLR group (8.9% vs 0%, respectively; P = .0012). No significant differences were found in frequency of graft rupture (ACLR, 5.4%; ACL + ALLR, 0.9%; P = .1191), range of motion deficits, pain, or reoperation for meniscectomy between groups. No cases of postoperative infection, venous thromboembolism, or arthrofibrosis were seen. Subjective IKDC (81.2 vs 86.8; P = .0048), Lysholm (88 vs 92; P = .0131), and some components of the KOOS were significantly better in the combined ACL + ALLR group.

Methods: This study was a double-blind, prospective 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Ninety-six consecutive patients with combined ACL and grade III MCL acute & subacute injuries between 2020 and 2022 with minimum 24-month follow-up were included in the study. Chronic MCL injuries and other ligament injuries were excluded, and computer-generated randomization was performed for allotment into 3 MCL management groups. ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft was performed and the MCL underwent repair in group 1 (n = 33), isolated suture-tape-bracing in group 2 (n = 32), and no repair in group 3 (n = 31). At follow-up, stress radiographs were used to analyze anterior and medial laxity. The International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, duration of surgery, and cost of surgery were compared. In addition, subgroup analysis was performed to assess outcomes based on location of MCL injury. Results: Demographic data, duration of injury, mode of injury, and distinct level of MCL injury were similar across groups. Overall, the incidence rates of MCL tears on the femoral side, at the midsubstance, and on the tibial side were 58.3%, 18.7%, and 23.0%, respectively. Postoperatively, significant improvements in range of motion (ROM) and functional scores were observed in all 3 groups (P <= .05); however, there were no statistically significant differences among the 3 groups at final follow-up in anterior tibial translation (P = .94), medial opening at 0 degrees of flexion (P = .8) and 30 degrees of flexion (P = .64), ROM (P = .39), International Knee Documentation Committee score (P = .17), Lysholm score (P = .14), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (P = .68). Three patients in group 2 had stiffness at 3 months: 2 were treated with continuous passive motion and physiotherapy, and 1 needed arthrolysis. Medial opening (at 0 degrees and at 30 degrees) was greater in group 3 patients with mid-substance MCL tears (P = .042 and P = .043, respectively). On minimal clinically important difference analysis, more than 80% of patients had improvement in ROM and functional scores, as well as medial opening of less than 5 mm, suggestive of successful outcomes in all 3 groups. The duration of surgery was longer in the repair group (P = .001), whereas cost was higher in the suture-tape bracing group (P = .003). Conclusions: MCL treatment with repair, isolated suture-tape-bracing, and no repair results in good radiologic outcomes (medial stress laxity) and functional outcomes when combined with ACL reconstruction. MCL repair or isolated suture-tape-bracing more effectively restores medial-sided stability. Mid-substance MCL tears may need an additional procedure (repair or bracing) to restore medial stability.

Purpose/Hypothesis: To report the prevalence of OA after ACL reconstruction and to compare the OA prevalence between quadrupled semitendinosus tendon (ST) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts. The hypothesis was that there would be no difference in OA prevalence between the graft types. The secondary aim was to study whether patient characteristics and additional injuries were associated with long-term outcomes. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Radiological examination results, Tegner activity levels, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) values were determined in 135 (82%) of 164 patients at a mean of 14 years after ACL reconstruction randomized to an ST or a BPTB graft. Osteoarthritis was defined according to a consensus by at least 2 of 3 radiologists of Kellgren-Lawrence grade >= 2. Using regression analysis, graft type, sex, age, overweight, time between injury and reconstruction, additional meniscus injury, and a number of other variables were assessed as risk factors for OA 14 years after ACL reconstruction. Results: Osteoarthritis of the medial compartment was most frequent, with 57% of OA cases in the ACL-reconstructed knee and 18% of OA cases in the contralateral knee (P < .001). There was no difference between the graft types: 49% of OA of the medial compartment for BPTB grafts and 65% for ST grafts (P = .073). The KOOS results were lower for patients with OA in all subscales, indicating that OA was symptomatic. No difference in the KOOS between the graft types was found. Meniscus resection was a strong risk factor for OA of the medial compartment (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-9.3) in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Neuromuscular training programs appear to be effective for reducing high-risk landing mechanics and preventing primary ACL injuries; however, there have been few attempts to examine their effects in athletes who have undergone ACL reconstruction. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of a neuromuscular training program that emphasizes external focus of attention cuing on biomechanics, knee proprioception, and patient-reported function in athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction and completed conventional post-operative rehabilitation. Methods: Twenty-four male athletes who had undergone primary, unilateral, hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction and completed conventional post-operative rehabilitation were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n = 12) who took part in an 8-week neuromuscular training program or a control group (n = 12) who continued a placebo program. The neuromuscular training program included lower extremity strengthening and plyometric exercises, balance training, and movement pattern re-training. Biomechanics during single-leg landing, knee proprioception, and patient-reported function were assessed before and after the 8-week training period. Results: Athletes in the experimental group demonstrated increased trunk, hip, and knee flexion angles and decreased knee abduction, internal rotation angles and knee valgus during landing following the intervention. Further, the experimental group decreased their peak knee extension and abduction moments and vertical ground reaction force on landing post-intervention. International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaire (IKDC) scores increased in the experimental group following training. The control group demonstrated no changes in any variable over the same time period. Conclusions: Neuromuscular training with external focus of attention cueing improved landing biomechanics in patients after ACL reconstruction.

Huis In",,,Self-reported functional recovery after reconstruction versus repair in acute anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ROTOR): a randomized controlled clinical trial,BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is today's surgical gold standard for ACL rupture. Although it provides satisfactory results, not all patients return to their previous activity level and moreover, early posttraumatic osteoarthritis is not prevented. As such, a renewed interest has emerged in ACL suture repair combined with dynamic augmentation. Compared to ACL reconstruction, the hypothesized advantages of ACL suture repair are earlier return to sports, reduction of early posttraumatic osteoarthritis and preservation of the patient's native ACL tissue and proprioceptive envelope of the knee. In recent literature, ACL suture repair combined with dynamic augmentation tends to be at least equally effective compared to ACL reconstruction, but no randomized comparative study has yet been conducted. Methods/design: This study is a prospective, stratified, block randomized controlled trial. Forty-eight patients with an ACL rupture will be assigned to either a suture repair group with dynamic augmentation and microfracture of the femoral notch, or an ACL reconstruction group with autologous semitendinosis graft and all-inside technique. The primary objective is to investigate the hypothesis that suture repair of a ruptured ACL results in at least equal effectiveness compared with an ACL reconstruction in terms of patient self-reported outcomes (IKDC 2000 subjective scale) 1 year postoperatively. Secondary objectives are to evaluate patient self-reported outcomes (IKDC 2000, KOOS, Tegner, VAS), re-rupture rate, rehabilitation time required for return to daily and sports activities, achieved levels of sports activity, clinimetrics (Rolimeter, LSI, Isoforce) and development of osteoarthritis, at short term (6 weeks, 3, 6 and 9 months and 1 year), midterm (2 and 5 years) and long term (10 years) postoperatively. Discussion: A renewed interest has emerged in ACL suture repair combined with dynamic augmentation in the treatment of ACL rupture. Recent cohort studies show good short- and midterm results for this technique.

Methods: Individuals with ACL reconstruction in the previous 6 months to 5 years were recruited. Immediate effects of a commercially-available elastic knee sleeve on single-leg horizontal hop distance were explored using a cross-over design. Following this first session, participants were randomised into a Control Group and a Sleeve Group who wore the sleeve for 6 weeks, at least 1 h daily. Outcome measures for the randomised clinical trial (RCT) were the International Knee Documentation Classification Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) score, the single-leg horizontal hop distance, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring peak torque.

The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the effect of a combined, progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise intervention on knee muscle strength, functional capacity and hamstring muscle-tendon morphology in ACL-reconstructed patients with persistent hamstring muscle-strength deficiency compared with controls. Methods/design:The study is designed as a multicenter, parallel-group RCT with balanced randomization (1:1) and blinded outcome assessments (level of evidence:II) and will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT Statement. Fifty ACL-reconstructed patients (hamstring auto-graft) with persistent limb-to-limb knee-flexor muscle-strength asymmetry at 12-24 months' post surgery, will be recruited through outpatient clinics and advertisements. Patients will be randomized to a 12-week progressive, strength and neuromuscular exercise group (SNG) with supervised training twice weekly or a control intervention (CON) consisting of a home-based, low-intensity exercise program. Outcome measures include between-group change in maximal isometric knee-flexor strength (primary outcome) and knee-extensor muscle strength, hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratios of the leg that has been operated on and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (secondary outcomes). In addition, several explorative outcomes will be investigated:The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC), the Tegner Activity Score, rate of force development (RFD) for the knee flexors and extensors, tendon regeneration and potential muscle hypertrophy at graft harvest site evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postural control, kinetic/kinematic gait characteristics and knee-related functional capacity. Discussion:This RCT is designed to investigate the effect of combined, progressive-resistance and neuromuscular exercises on knee-flexor/extensor strength, in the late rehabilitation phase following ACL reconstruction. Reduced hamstring strength represents a potential risk factor for secondary ACL rupture and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis. If deemed effective, the intervention paradigm introduced in this study may help to improve current treatment strategies in ACLreconstructed patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 26,2018,19,,,,,,,,75,10.1186/s13063-018-2448-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-018-2448-3,,,,,,,,29373984,,,,,WOS:000423321100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Patients and methods Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 +/- 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 +/- 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 +/- 3.9 (range = 85-100). Conclusion Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands.

Hypothesis: Fixation of hamstring tendon grafts with a porous bone scaffold limits bone tunnel enlargement compared with a biodegradable interference screw fixation. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Between 2005 and 2006, 20 patients (17 men, 3 women) with a primary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized to obtain graft fixation in the tibial tunnel either by means of an interference screw (1) or a press-fit fixation with a porous bone cylinder (P). At 3 months after surgery, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the knee was performed, and tunnel enlargement was analyzed in the coronal and sagittal planes for the proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the tunnel. After 6 months and 1 and 2 years, radiographs of the knee in the sagittal and coronal plane were analyzed for bone tunnel widening. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Tegner, and Lysholm scores of both groups were compared after 1 and 2 years. Results: The bone tunnel enlargement determined by CT was 106.9% +/- 10.9% for group P and 121.9% +/- 9.0% for group I (P < .02) in the anteroposterior (AP) plane and 102.8% +/- 15.2% versus 121.5% +/- 10.1 % in the coronal plane (P < .01).

Stefan",,,A Randomized Trial of Treatment for Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears,NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"BACKGROUND The optimal management of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is unknown. METHODS We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 121 young, active adults with acute ACL injury in which we compared two strategies: structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and structured rehabilitation with the option of later ACL reconstruction if needed. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 2 years in the average score on four subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) - pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS4; range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). Secondary outcomes included results on all five KOOS subscales, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the score on the Tegner Activity Scale. RESULTS Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 1 did not undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction, 23 underwent delayed ACL reconstruction; the other 36 underwent rehabilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean KOOS4 score from baseline to 2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95% confidence interval, -6.5 to 6.8; P=0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary outcomes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received. CONCLUSIONS In young, active adults with acute ACL tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction. The latter strategy substantially reduced the frequency of surgical reconstructions.

According to new evidence, tunnel enlargement may be followed by tunnel narrowing, but the long-term evolution of the tunnels is currently unknown. Hypothesis/Purpose: The hypothesis was that tunnel enlargement is followed by tunnel narrowing caused by ossification as seen in follow-up using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ossification pattern of the tunnels, the communication of the 2 femoral and 2 tibial tunnels, and screw absorption findings in MRI. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Thirty-one patients underwent anatomic double-bundle ACLR with hamstring grafts and bioabsorbable interference screw fixation and were followed with MRI and clinical evaluation at 2 and 5 years postoperatively. Results: The mean tunnel enlargement at 2 years was 58% and reduced to 46% at 5 years. Tunnel ossification resulted in evenly narrowed tunnels in 44%, in conical tunnels in 48%, and fully ossified tunnels in 8%. Tunnel communication increased from 13% to 23% in the femur and from 19% to 23% in the tibia between 2 and 5 years and was not associated with knee laxity. At 5 years, 54% of the screws were not visible, with 35% of the screws replaced by a cyst and 19% fully ossified. Tunnel cysts were not associated with worse patient-reported outcomes or knee laxity. Patients with a tibial anteromedial tunnel cyst had higher Lysholm scores than patients without a cyst (93 and 84, P = 03).

Methods Sixty consecutive patients with isolated ACL tears who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction were prospectively monitored using the Questions on Life Satisfaction Modules (FLZ(M)) and  Short-Form 12 (SF-12) quality-of-life outcome measures. The Lysholm score and Tegner activity index were used as functional outcome measures. Additionally, return to work (months) together with level of physical workload was analysed. Outcome measures were assessed the day before surgery and at 6, 12 weeks and 6, 12, and 24 months post-operatively. Qualityof- life outcomes were correlated with functional outcome scores. Results Satisfaction with health (FLZ(M)) significantly improved within the first 2 years (p < 0.05), and the physical component scale (SF12) showed a significantly higher score after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months as compared with preoperative values (p < 0.05). General life satisfaction (FLZ(M)) was initially decreased at 6 weeks (p < 0.05) but increased during the further follow-up period, reaching a score not significantly different from preoperative values. Mean Lysholm score improved from 66 preoperatively to 89 post-operatively (p < 0.05) and the median Tegner activity index improved from four to six points (p < 0.05) at final follow-up. Mean time to return to work was 7 weeks (range 1-34 weeks), and it strongly depended on physical workload. A positive correlation between quality of life and functional outcome (Lysholm score) was observed. Conclusion General life satisfaction is impaired during the early post-operative course, but returns to preoperative values after 2 years. Satisfaction with health reaches higher values after 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively, and the SF-12 physical component scale was seen to improve during the follow-up period. Improved functional outcomes were observed to correlate with qualityof- life measurements.

However, little attention has been given to outcomes during the early phase of recovery and how early deficits affect both short-and long-term outcomes. Objective: To identify relationships between demographic (age, sex, and body mass index [BMI]) and intraoperative (isolated ACLR versus primary ACLR+secondary procedures), and postoperative (range-of-motion [ROM] and peak isometric knee-extension force [PIF]) variables during the first 2 months after ACLR using self-reported outcomes. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Outpatient orthopaedic hospital. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 63 patients (38 men, 25 women; age -33.0 +/- 12.1 years; BMI = 26.3 +/- 6.5 kg/m(2)) who underwent ACLR. Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were collected at 1 and 2 months after ACLR and were compared with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form scores at 1, 2, and >= 12 months. Results: Significant relationships were identified between >= 12-month IKDC scores and the 1-month (Pearson correlation, r = 0.283, r(2) = 0.08; P = .025) and 2-month (r = 0.301, r(2) = 0.09; P = .017) IKDC scores. After controlling for other variables, we found that the PIF ratio measures at 1 and 2 months were positively associated with 1- and 2-month IKDC scores (P<.001) and BMI was negatively associated with both 1- and 2-month IKDC scores (P<.05). One-month IKDC scores were related to the 1-month difference in knee-flexion ROM (P - .04). Conclusions: The IKDC scores during the first 2 months were positively correlated with patients' perceptions of function on long-term IKDC scores.

All patients initially underwent arthroscopic surgery and a rehabilitation program. They were advised to modify their activity level, especially by avoiding contact sports. Patients with recurrent giving-way episodes and/or secondary meniscal injuries that required fixation (n = 6) were subsequently excluded and underwent reconstruction (n = 22). Sixty-seven patients with unilateral nonreconstructed ACL injury remained at the 15-year follow-up.

Hypothesis: A comprehensive rehabilitation program supplemented with quadriceps strengthening in open kinetic chain (OKC) exercise will increase quadriceps strength and improve knee function without increasing static or dynamic sagittal tibial translation, compared with the same comprehensive rehabilitation program supplemented with quadriceps strengthening in closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise, in patients with acute ACL deficiency. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Forty-two patients were tested a mean of 43 days (range, 20-96 days) after an ACL injury. Patients were randomized to rehabilitation with CKC quadriceps strengthening (11 men and 9 women) or OKC quadriceps strengthening (13 men and 9 women). Aside from these quadriceps exercises, the 2 rehabilitation programs were identical. Patients were assessed after 4 months of rehabilitation. Sagittal static translation and dynamic tibial translation were evaluated with a CA-4000 electrogoniometer. Muscle strength, jump performance, and muscle activation were also assessed. Functional outcome was evaluated by determining the Lysholm score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Results: There were no group differences in static or dynamic translation after rehabilitation. The OKC group had significantly greater isokinetic quadriceps strength after rehabilitation (P =.009). The hamstring strength, performance on the 1-repetition-maximum squat test, muscle activation, jump performance, and functional outcome did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Rehabilitation with OKC quadriceps exercise led to significantly greater quadriceps strength compared with rehabilitation with CKC quadriceps exercise.

Nineteen patients were randomized to the aggressive group (53% male, mean age 30.1 + 10.5 y) and 17 to the nonaggressive group (88% male, mean age 33.1 + 10.9 y). Impairment measures of anteroposterior (A-P) knee laxity, range of motion (ROM), and peak isometric force (PIF) values were obtained 12 wk postoperatively. Subjective response to the International Knee Documentation Committee knee form (IKDC) was collected 1, 12, and 24 wk postoperatively. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze differences between groups at 12 wk for A-P knee laxity, ROM, and PIF. Differences between the groups for the IKDC scores were determined using 1-way ANOVA with repeated measures 1, 12, and 24 wk postoperatively. Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. Results: There were no differences between the groups for the baseline characteristics (P > .05). There was no difference found between the groups in respect to A-P knee laxity, ROM, or PIF at 12 wk (P > .05). Further analysis also showed no significant differences in the IKDC scores between groups at 12 or 24 wk (P > .05). Conclusions: No differences were found between early aggressive and nonaggressive rehabilitation after an isolated ACL-R using STG autografts for the primary outcomes of A-P knee laxity and subjective IKDC score. In addition, no differences were observed for secondary outcomes between groups for differences in ROM and PIF values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2013,22,3,,,,,191,201,,10.1123/jsr.22.3.191,http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/jsr.22.3.191,,,,,,,,23579334,,,,,WOS:000322365100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there are no clinical trials that evaluated outcomes of OKC exercises in a restricted ROM for pain, function, muscle strength, and anterior knee laxity at 1 year after surgery. Purpose: To determine if an early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strength in a restricted ROM would promote a clinical improvement without causing increased anterior knee laxity in patients after ACL reconstruction. Study Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 49 patients between 16 and 50 years of age who underwent ACL reconstruction with semitendinosus and gracilis autografts were randomly assigned to an early start OKC (EOKC) exercise group or a late start OKC (LOKC) exercise group. The EOKC group (n = 25; mean age, 26 years) received a rehabilitation protocol with an early start of OKC (fourth week postoperatively) within a restricted ROM between 45 degrees and 90 degrees. The LOKC group (n = 24; mean age, 24 years) performed the same protocol with a late start of OKC exercises between 0 degrees and 90 degrees (12th week postoperatively). Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Lysholm knee scoring scale, single-legged and crossover hop tests, and anterior knee laxity were measured to assess outcomes at the 12-week, 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month postoperative follow-up (range, 13-24 months). Results: No difference (P<.05) was noted between groups with respect to demographic data. Both groups (EOKC and LOKC) had a higher level of function and less pain at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month assessments when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P<.05). The EOKC group had improved quadriceps muscle strength at the 19-week, 25-week, and 17-month follow-up when compared with 12 weeks postoperatively (P<.05); the LOKC group showed improvement only at the 17-month postoperative assessment. However, the analysis between groups showed no difference for all pain and functional assessments, including anterior knee laxity (P>.05). Conclusion: An early start of OKC exercises for quadriceps strengthening in a restricted ROM did not differ from a late start in terms of anterior knee laxity. The EOKC group reached the same findings in relation to pain decrease and functional improvement when compared with the LOKC group but showed a faster recovery in quadriceps strength. The nonweightbearing exercises seem appropriate for patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction, when utilized in a specific ROM. The magnitude of difference in quadriceps strength between the 2 rehabilitation protocols was around 5%; however, this difference was not clinically significant, especially because both groups had equal function on the hop tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2013,41,4,,,,,788,794,,10.1177/0363546513476482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546513476482,,,,,,,,23423316,,,,,WOS:000318295500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

A new treatment option is to administer autologous conditioned serum (ACS) containing endogenous anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1Ra and growth factors (IGF-1, PDGF, and TGF-beta 1, among others) in the liquid blood phase. The purpose of this trial was to establish whether the postoperative outcome could be affected by intraarticular application of ACS. Methods In a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups, 62 patients were treated. Bone tunnel width was measured by CT scans, while clinical efficacy was assessed by patient-administered outcome instruments (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) up to 1 year following the ACL reconstruction in patients receiving either ACS (Group A) or placebo (Group B). We compared the levels and dynamics of IL-1 beta concentrations in the synovial liquid and examined the correlation between the levels of IL-1 beta at three different postoperative points. Results Bone tunnel enlargement was significantly less (6 months: 8%, 12 months: 13%) in Group A than in Group B (6 months: 31%, 12 months: 38%). Clinical outcomes (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) were consistently better in patients treated with ACS at all data points and for all outcome parameters, and there were statistically significant differences in the WOMAC stiffness subscale after 1 year. The decrease in IL-1 beta synovial fluid concentration was more pronounced in the ACS group, and values were lower, to a statistically significant degree, in the ACS group at day 10.

Methods This was a randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from April 2022 to October 2023 at a tertiary care center. One hundred patients with isolated, unilateral, chronic ACL tears were randomised 1:1 to receive either an intra-articular injection containing TXA (1 g), morphine sulphate, ketorolac, lidocaine and normal saline (intervention group) or an identical injection without TXA (control group). All surgeries were performed using hamstring autografts and standardised surgical and postoperative protocols. All patients received 15 mg/kg intravenous TXA in addition to intra-articular TXA. The primary outcomes were pain scores (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS) at predefined time points up to 3 months. The secondary outcomes were Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm scores, range of motion, swelling and morphine consumption. Results Postoperative pain scores did not differ significantly between groups at any time point (p > 0.05). Both groups demonstrated significant within-group improvements over time in KOOS subscores (p < 0.001) and Lysholm scores (p < 0.001). Postoperative morphine consumption was similar in both groups (p > 0.05). The TXA group had better Lysholm scores at 1 month (85.8 +/- 9.1 vs. 79.6 +/- 13.9; p < 0.01). The TXA group had significantly better KOOS subscores and Lysholm scores at 3 months with moderate effect size (p < 0.01). No serious complications were observed in either group. Conclusion Intra-articular TXA did not significantly reduce early postoperative pain or opioid use when added to a multimodal analgesic regimen and intravenous TXA in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. However, it was associated with modest improvements in functional recovery at 1 and 3 months postoperatively, as measured by KOOS and Lysholm scores.Level of Evidence Level I.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2025,12,4,,,,,,,e70460,10.1002/jeo2.70460,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeo2.70460,,,,,,,,41078383,,,,,WOS:001591103000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The modified Brostrom-Gould (MBG) procedure remains the gold standard; however, there are a number of relative contraindications to this procedure, and the longer-term outcomes after the MBG have been questioned. An alternative procedure is augmentation of a primary repair with a ligament augmentation reconstruction system (LARS). Purpose: To conduct a randomized controlled trial testing the null-hypothesis that there is no difference in patient scored outcomes and activity levels, between patients undergoing a MBG procedure compared with those undergoing a primary repair with LARS augmentation, for lateral ligament instability of the ankle. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria were invited to take part in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to undergo the LARS or MBG procedure. Both groups followed similar postoperative rehabilitation. Patients completed the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) before surgery and then at 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery. Tegner activity scores were recorded at 5years. The scores in the 2 groups were compared via statistical analysis (P < .05). Results: Of the 50 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria, 47 agreed to take part in the study. Twenty-two were randomized to the LARS group and 25 to the MBG group. At 5 years, follow-up data were complete for 20 patients in the LARS group and 21 in the MBG. There were 2 failures in the MBG group and 0 in the LARS group. The LARS group had significantly better improvement in total FAOS at 1 year (mean +/- SD, 92.4 +/- 2.5 vs 78.2 +/- 3.4, P = .005), 2 years (94.0 +/- 3.0 vs 78.0 +/- 5.2, P = .003), and 5 years (93.7 +/- 6.0 vs 75.1 +/- 5.5, P = .002) after surgery. The 5-year Tegner activity scores were higher in the LARS group (8.25 +/- 1.1 vs 7.2 +/- 0.9, P = .03). Conclusion: Among physically active patients with chronic lateral ligament instability, primary repair combined with LARS results in better total FAOS at 5-year follow-up and higher Tegner activity scores as compared with the MBG procedure.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate ACL graft and contralateral rupture following ipsilateral or contralateral semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) graft harvest at follow-up of a minimum 10 years post-reconstruction in the treatment of a complete ACL tear. Methods Patients from a previous randomized trial were evaluated. The primary outcome measures were ipsilateral and contralateral reinjury as well as the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, the ACL Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QoL) and the Tegner activity scale. Participants completed four different single-leg hop tests and concentric knee flexion and extension strength were assessed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Results Of the original 100 patients, 50 patients (41.3 +/- 9.5 years of age, 31 males, 19 females) reported on re-injury at 12.6 +/- 1.4 years post-operative. Thirty-eight patients returned for full assessment and 12 responded by mail or phone survey. There were no differences between groups for graft rupture, contralateral injury, ACL-QoL score, IKDC categorization, or anterior tibial translation, though both groups experienced a reduction in the Tegner Activity Scale from their preinjury scores. There was no difference in knee flexor and extensor isokinetic concentric strength, or single leg hop test performance. Knee flexor strength limb symmetry index was reduced when measured in the supine relative to the seated position in both groups, indicating persistent deficits in knee flexor strength when measured in the supine position. Conclusion Contralateral hamstring harvest does not put patients at an increased risk of a contralateral ACL tear and long-term outcomes of ACL reconstruction do not differ based on the side of graft harvest.

However, the ideal graft source is still debatable. This study compared hamstring (HT) and bone-free quadriceps (QT) tendon autografts in terms of muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes.MethodsBetween June 2018 and December 2019, 46 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of two groups for the ACL reconstruction surgery-the HT autograft group or the QT autograft group. An experienced examiner performed preoperative and postoperative examinations. The HUMAC NORM isokinetic machine (Computer Sports Medicine International-CSMI, 2004) was used to assess flexor and extensor thigh muscle strength. Both groups received the same surgical technique and fixation method. All patients were examined after three, six, nine, and 12 months. The final evaluations were performed at the 24-month follow-up. Patients' scores on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation form and the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale were used to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. The two groups were also compared in terms of postoperative complications and activity levels.ResultsThe difference between preoperative and postoperative knee flexor peak torques (FPT) was lower in the QT group than in the HT group. The average difference between preoperative and postoperative knee extensor peak torque (EPT) was higher in the QT group than in the HT group. As a result, the HT group had a lower postoperative H/Q ratio (flexor strength normalized to body mass divided by extensor strength normalized to body mass) than the QT group (p < 0.001). The mean IKDC scores for the HT and QT groups were 90.13 & PLUSMN; 6.99 and 87.12 & PLUSMN; 6.61, respectively. The scores of the two groups postoperatively were close, and both groups showed significant improvement. The average graft size in the QT group was significantly greater than that in the HT group. Saphenous nerve palsy was the most common complication in the HT group (22%). Thigh hematomas were observed in two patients in the QT group and required urgent intervention (12%).ConclusionAfter ACL reconstruction, we found a significant decrease in strength at the donor sites in both techniques, with similar patient-reported measures and stability outcomes. The H/Q strength ratio was higher in the QT group postoperatively, which may have a protective effect on the reconstructed ligament.Level of Evidence I It is a randomized controlled trial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2024,34,1,,,,,293,301,,10.1007/s00590-023-03636-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00590-023-03636-5,,JUL 2023,,,,,,37468645,,,,,WOS:001032031200001,View Full Record in Web of Science
