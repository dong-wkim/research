Patients and methods Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 +/- 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 +/- 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 +/- 3.9 (range = 85-100). Conclusion Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 23,2024,145,1,,,,,,,85,10.1007/s00402-024-05639-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00402-024-05639-1,,,,,,,,39714511,,,,,WOS:001388192900002,View Full Record in Web of Science
