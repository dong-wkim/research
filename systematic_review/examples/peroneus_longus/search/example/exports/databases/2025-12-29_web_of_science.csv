Materials and methods: All the 18 patients underwent arthroscopic single-stage revision ACLR using autologous PLT with an additional modified Limier LET procedure. Patients were thoroughly assessed pre- and post-operatively by the Lachman test, the pivot shift test, and the side-to-side difference by the Rolimeter. Functional evaluation was done with the help of the Lysholm score, the IKDC subjective score, Tegner score, VAS score, MARX activity rating scale and The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. Post-operatively, patient satisfaction, return to sport, and physical activity were also recorded. SPSS ver. 22.0 software was used. Wilcoxon test, paired and unpaired t-tests were used to compare variables. Statistical significance was determined by a two-sided p-value <0.05. Results: Regarding subjective evaluations; post-operative residual laxity, and return to sport and physical activity, all of the patients demonstrated excellent results. Post-operatively, there was significant improvement in the anterior knee laxity. According to the Marx Activity Rating Scale, the extent of sports engagement was significantly increased at 18 months following surgery (p<0.001). According to the AOFAS score (p=0.38), there were no documented significant donor site morbidities. Conclusions: Single-stage revision ACLR using PLT with an additional modified Lemaire LET procedure results in a significant reduction in residual knee laxity with good clinical outcomes and a high return to play and physical activity.","[Sonarkar, Ss; Stanley, A.] 7 AF Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Rehabil, Kanpur, India; [Kumar-Singh, S.] Maa Vindhyavasini Autonomous State Med Coll, Dept Orthopaed, Mirzapur 231001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Garg, R.] Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Mem Med Coll, Dept Orthopaed, Kanpur, India; [Narula, A.] Dr Aditya Narula Aakaar Bone Care, Dept Orthopaed, Kanpur, India; [Raj, M.] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthopaed, Deoghar, India","G.S.V.M.

PLT is thought to play some role in the proprioceptive regulation of the ankle joint. ACL too has a vital role in the postural control of the knee joint. This study evaluates and compares the affected and sound limb balance and function in subjects following ACLR with autologous PLTG. Methods: A total of 44 eligible participants were assessed for balance using the HUMAC balance system and function with the Foot Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) scale at 6week, 3month, and 6month after ACLR with PLTG. Outcome measures were stability score, path length, average velocity, time on target, and FAAM score. Results: There was statistically significant improvement in all the parameters of bilateral or unilateral standing balance at 6month post-op [Bilateral: stability score: p=0.001; path length: p=0.000; average velocity: p=0.000; time on target: p=0.006]; [unilateral-affected/sound: path length: p=0.000, p=0.003; average velocity: p=0.000, p=0.009). The difference between affected and sound limb balance was insignificant. Median of FAAM score at 6week, 3month, & 6month were 97.368, 98.809 and 100 respectively. Conclusion: Balance of the whole body or any single leg stability is impaired after ACLR with PLTG, but it may improve to an optimal level with due time and recover fully by six months. Donor ankle function also restores to 100% at 6month.","[Sahu, Mamata Manjari; Mohanty, Patitapaban] Swami Vivekananda Natl Inst Rehabil Training & Re, Dept Physiotherapy, Cuttack 754010, Odisha, India; [Pragassame, S.

The results of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are usually worse than the primary ACLR. The positive outcome of the revision ACLR is significantly influenced by the following factors: anatomical position of bone tunnels, correct choice of graft, its preparation and fixation method. Equally important is to choose the accurate indications for additional extraarticular interventions. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft in one-stage revision ACL reconstruction and to compare the obtained data with the results of primary ACLR. Methods. The comparison was carried out between the RACL-PLT group (n = 29) and the PACL-HT group (n = 82), which underwent single-stage revision ACLR with a PLT autograft and primary ACLR with a hamstring tendons (HT) autograft, respectively. Subjective and objective evaluation was performed on the KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm Knee scales. Also, in the RACL-PLT group, the position of the central entry points into the primary and revision tunnels was determined. Results. We observed no statistically significant differences during the objective assessment of knee joint stability between the groups (p>0.999). During the subjective assessment on the KOOS, IKDC and Lysholm Knee scales, significantly higher results were obtained in the PACL-HT group (p<0.001). The position of the central entry points into the revision tunnels corresponded to the normative values in all cases. Conclusions. The analysis of the use of a PLT autograft in revision ACLR, as well as the achievement of the anatomical position of the revision tunnels showed: 12 months after surgery, the results of an objective assessment between the revision and primary ACLR are comparable; the results of a subjective assessment are statistically significantly different. However, the differences in indicators do not reach a minimal clinically important difference.","[Gofer, Anton S.; Alekperov, Aleksandr A.; Gurazhev, Mikhail B.; Avdeev, Artem K.; L.

The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied.Methods: Two hundred and thirty-two patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using doubled PLT autograft or quadrupled HT autograft; 158 were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3,6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared.Results:The mean diameter of PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of HT autograft, and the mean graft-harvesting time was less (p < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 34 days earlier than those in the HT group (p < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity and, at 6 months, better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of graft rupture or in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up.Conclusions: PLT is a suitable autograft for ACLR in terms of graft diameter and graft-harvesting time and may offer athletes an earlier return to sports related to better outcomes at 6 months of follow-up. HT autograft was associated with increased thigh weakness. Both grafts, however, performed similarly at 24 months postoperatively.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level II.","[Bin Saeed, Usama] Abwa Med Coll, Dept Orthoped Surg, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan; [Ramzan, Asad] Shalamar Med & Dent Coll, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan; [Anwar, Marryam] Noorda Coll Osteopath Med, Provo, UT USA; [Tariq, Hamza; Tariq, Huzaifa] Faisalabad Med Univ, Allied Hosp, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan; [Yasin, Ajmal] Yasin Mem Hosp, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan; [Mehmood, Tariq] Tariq Trauma Ctr, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan",,"Ramzan, A (corresponding author), Shalamar Med & Dent Coll, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.",doctorsaeed29@gmail.com; asadramzan61@yahoo.com; marryamanwar678@gmail.com; hamza-tariq@live.com; zamanpark60@gmail.com; jinnah414@gmail.com; tariq-ort@hotmail.com,"; Mehmood, Tariq/KTI-3565-2024","Ramzan, Asad/0000-0002-2682-6041; Tariq, Huzaifa/0009-0000-3404-0041; Tariq, Hamza/0009-0006-7241-3367; SAEED, USAMA Bin/0000-0001-6905-8823",,,,,22,7,8,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",,2472-7245,,JBJS OPEN ACCESS,JBJS Open Access,,2023,8,4,,,,,,,e2300051,10.2106/JBJS.OA.23.00051,http://dx.doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.OA.23.00051,,,10,Orthopedics; Surgery,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Orthopedics; Surgery,Z8KJ0,38058511,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:001114504700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system-Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. ResultsOne year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p > 0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p > 0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p < 0.05). ConclusionACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles.","[Zhang, Shichao; Cai, Guoping; Ge, Zhe] Fudan Univ, Jinshan Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, 1508 Longhang Rd, Shanghai 201508, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Ge, Z (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Jinshan Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, 1508 Longhang Rd, Shanghai 201508, Peoples R China.",gezhe021@163.com,,,"Youth Research Initiation Fund of Jinshan Hospital, Fudan University [JYQN-JC-202001]","Youth Research Initiation Fund of Jinshan Hospital, Fudan University","This study was supported by the Youth Research InitiationFund of Jinshan Hospital, Fudan University (No. JYQN-JC-202001)",,28,8,9,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-7853,1757-7861,,ORTHOP SURG,Orthop.

Methods: 53 patients (group 1) received ACL reconstruction via BPTB, whereas 55 patients (group 2) received arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using PLT autograft. Results: In group 1, the mean preoperative and postoperative scores on the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire (LKQ) scale resulted in 69.2 +/- 10.7 points and -92.2 +/- 6.4 points, respectively. The average preoperative and postoperative value on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale was 68.2 +/- 10.6% and -90.1 +/- 9.5%, respectively. For KT-1000, according to the results of surgical treatment, it is -3.7 +/- 1.4 mm, and for the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOSAF) it is -95.3 +/- 4.5%. The autograft ruptured within 2 years after operation in 4 of 50 patients. In group 2, the mean score on the LKQ scale before the operation was 70.2 +/- 11.6 points, after -94.3 +/- 0.5 points. The average value on the IKDC scale before surgery was 68.6 +/- 8.7%, after -91.5 +/- 8.2%. KT-1000 -3.4 +/- 1.2 mm.

Methodology: A total of 80 cases aged 15 - 40 years undergoing single-bundle ACL reconstruction fromJanuary 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled. All were randomly assigned to either hamstring tendon group or PLT group. Functional scoring as International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores were noted prior to surgery and at the end of follow-up period of 9-months after surgery. Donor-site morbidity was also assessed. Results: Out of 80 cases, there were 66 (82.5%) were male. Mean age in hamstring group was 27.4 + 9.1 versus 25.8 + 8.6 years in PLT group (p = 0.4214). Thigh circumference between operated and sound leg was significantly high in hamstring group (p < 0.0001). None of the patient in PLT group had any other donor-site morbidity while 6 (16.7%) patients in hamstring group were found to have anterior kneeling pain.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective matched cohort study with 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching without replacement on sex (exact), age (+/- 3 years), and time to last follow-up (closest match) was performed on consecutive primary single-bundle ACLR cases. After exclusions and follow-up completion, 77 PLT patients were matched 1:1 with 82 HT patients based on age, sex, and follow-up. Outcomes included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form, Lysholm Knee Score, Tegner Activity Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, knee range of motion, manual strength testing, stability tests, limb circumferences, and the Single-Leg Hop test. Additionally, ankle-specific function in the PLT group was assessed using the AOFAS and FADI scores. Results: Graft diameter was larger with PLT (8.5 +/- 0.6 mm) than with HT (8.1 +/- 0.7 mm; p = 0.003). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement from the preoperative to the postoperative period on the IKDC, Lysholm, and Tegner scores (all p < 0.001). Between groups, postoperative IKDC and Lysholm scores were comparable (both p > 0.05), and Tegner scores did not differ significantly (p > 0.05). Knee flexion loss was less frequent (9.1% vs. 68.3%; p = 0.001), and knee flexion strength was higher (4.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.8; p = 0.001) in PLT. Stability tests, LSI, extension strength, and limb circumferences were similar (all p > 0.05). Saphenous nerve symptoms were less frequent with PLT (13.0% vs. 29.3%; p = 0.010). Ankle function in PLT was preserved (AOFAS 96.9 +/- 7.9; FADI 97.4 +/- 8.5) with mild eversion limitation in 3 patients (3.9%). Re-rupture rates were low and did not differ significantly between groups (p > 0.05). Infections occurred only after HT, yielding a between-group difference (p = 0.030). Conclusions: PLT autografts provide clinical and functional outcomes comparable to those of HT, with advantages including a larger graft diameter, better preservation of knee flexion function, fewer symptoms related to the saphenous nerve, and excellent ankle outcomes. PLT is a safe and effective alternative for primary ACLR.","[Sari, Mustafa Kursat; Kose, Ozkan] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkiye",Antalya Training & Research Hospital,"Kose, O (corresponding author), Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkiye.",mustafakursatsari@gmail.com; drozkankose@hotmail.com,"Kose, Ozkan/P-8732-2016",,,,,,57,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. Purpose: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30 degrees of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. Results: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 +/- 0.62 vs 7.0 +/- 2.18 mm, respectively; P < .001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 +/- 8.27, 50.9 +/- 8.50, and 1.8 +/- 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 +/- 2.61, 95.2 +/- 2.64, and 6.8 +/- 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P < .001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively. No complications or reoperations occurred.

There is no published literature regarding the anthropometric predictors for the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft obtained in ACL reconstruction through the inframalleolar approach. Methods: Fifty-two patients were finally evaluated for anthropometric parameters to predict quadrupled PLT graft diameter in ACL reconstruction using the inframalleolar technique. Intraoperative quadrupled PLT graft diameter was correlated to the patient's anthropometric data such as age, height, weight, duration of injury, and BMI. We used regression analysis in a stepwise manner to ascertain anthropometric indices associated with the graft diameter. Results: This study included 46 males and six females. Mean age was 28.2 +/- 7.4 years, mean height was 172.7 +/- 2.8 cm, mean weight was 75.6 +/- 3.4 kg, mean BMI was 25.3 +/- 0.9 kg/m2, mean duration of injury was 9.2 +/- 3.9 months, and mean graft diameter was 9.3 +/- 0.4 mm. Positive correlation with graft diameter was found only with height (r = 0.6, P < 0.01) and weight (r = 0.4, P 0.01). On analysing through linear regression, height and weight had significant association with graft diameter, and we formulated the following prediction equation: PLT graft diameter (mm) = 0.083 x height (cm) + 0.011 x weight (kg) -5.854. Conclusion: Patients' characteristics, including height and weight, have a significant correlation with quadrupled PLT graft diameter and the average diameter of graft is 9 mm through this approach.","[Khan, Mohammad Jesan; Asif, Naiyer; Firoz, Danish; Khan, Abdul Qayyum; Bin Sabir, Aamir; Siddiqui, Yasir Salam] AMU, Fac Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, JN Med Coll, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India",Aligarh Muslim University,"Khan, MJ (corresponding author), AMU, Fac Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, JN Med Coll, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India.",mzkhan2k1@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,11,11,0,0,E-CENTURY PUBLISHING CORP,MADISON,"40 WHITE OAKS LN, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",2160-2026,,,INT J BURNS TRAUMA,Int.

The choice of graft material in ACL reconstruction is crucial for optimal postoperative results, and this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the comparative efficacy of these two graft types. Method This open-label randomized comparative study involved a carefully selected cohort of patients undergoing single -bundle arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PL graft group or the hamstring graft group. Surgical procedures were conducted using standardized techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols were closely monitored. Functional outcomes, including range of motion, stability, and patient-reported measures, were assessed at predefined intervals to ensure comprehensive data collection. Results The study underscores significant demographic and clinical factors in ACL reconstruction outcomes. Participants were predominantly aged 17-30 years (58.33%) with a mean age of 29.27 years and exhibited a male predominance (80.56%). Common complaints included knee pain and instability, primarily due to falls from bikes (55.56%) or sports-related trauma (44.44%). Notably, PL grafts demonstrated advantages over hamstring grafts, with longer mean length (10.11 mm vs. 8.77 mm, p=0.0001) and shorter operation times. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner Lysholm scores show no significant differences between grafts over the period of time. There is no notable foot eversion weakness or significant donor site morbidity after the PL graft harvest. Hamstring graft cases exhibit a higher incidence of altered sensation and muscle atrophy, suggesting the potential benefits of PL grafts for improved surgical outcomes. Conclusions Graft comparisons favored PL grafts due to longer length, and functional outcome assessments between the two graft types. However, foot and ankle strength assessments revealed fluctuations in strength recovery with PL grafts, highlighting the need for tailored rehabilitation. Thigh circumference variations suggested potential muscle atrophy in the hamstring graft group, along with reported paresthesia in the ipsilateral proximal leg. In conclusion, PL grafts offer potential advantages for ACL surgery, but ongoing monitoring and specialized rehabilitation are crucial.","[Dwidmuthe, Samir; Roy, Mainak; Math, Suhas Aradhya Bhikshavarthi; Sah, Saurabh; Bhavani, Prashant; Sadar, Amey] All India Inst Med Sci, Orthopaed, Nagpur, India",All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Nagpur,"Roy, M (corresponding author), All India Inst Med Sci, Orthopaed, Nagpur, India.",roymainak995@gmail.com,"ROY, MAINAK/KYP-5967-2024; Dwidmuthe, Samir/AAU-4143-2021","ROY, MAINAK/0009-0002-3339-2744;",,,,,15,4,4,1,2,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2168-8184,,CUREUS J MED SCIENCE,Cureus J Med Sci,MAY 13,2024,16,5,,,,,,,e60239,10.7759/cureus.60239,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.60239,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),General & Internal Medicine,TW1E7,38872693,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:001244197200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Patients and methods Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. Results Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 +/- 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 +/- 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 +/- 3.9 (range = 85-100). Conclusion Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.","[Butt, Umer; Shaikh, M.

Patients and methods: A total of 52 patients (38 males, 14 females; mean age: 29.27.7 years; range, 17 to 51 years) who received PLT autograft for ACL reconstruction in our center between July 2018 and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics of the patients and leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters were recorded before the operation. The PLT autograft diameter and length were measured during surgery. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found between the graft diameter and length and weight, height, body mass index (BMI), leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters (p 0.01). There was no statistically significant correlation between the graft diameter and length and age (p 0.05). Distal leg diameter had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft diameter (r=0.956), while the height had the highest correlation coefficient for the PLT autograft length (r=0.982). Conclusion: Anthropometric parameters of height, weight, BMI, leg length, and proximal and distal leg diameters may be helpful for surgeons to predict the diameter and length of the PLT autograft before surgery. Distal leg diameter is a particularly important parameter in predicting PLT autograft diameter.","[Ertilav, Devran] Aydin State Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Aydin, Turkey",Aydin State Hospital,"Ertilav, D (corresponding author), Aydin Devlet Hastanesi, Ortopedi & Travmatol Klin, TR-09100 Aydin, Turkey.",ertilavdevran@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,5,8,0,2,TURKISH JOINT DISEASES FOUNDATION,CANKARA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAHALLESI, DUMLUPINAR BULVARI 274-2 C2 BLOK OFIS, 5, CANKARA, ANKARA, TURKEY",2687-4784,2687-4792,,JOINT DIS RELAT SURG,Joint Dis.

While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population.Matreials and methodsThis was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients.Results20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 +/- 1.34 and 98.5 +/- 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 +/- 9.43 and 88.75 +/- 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886 +/- 22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 +/- 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio.ConclusionWhile the use of peroneus longus tendon autografts in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction does not seem problematic on short-term subjective assessment, there is objective evidence in keeping with evertor weakness, weakness of first ray plantar flexion and possible ankle instability.Level of EvidenceLevel lll.","[Mirza, Kiyana; Austine, Jose] Norfolk & Norwich Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Trauma & Orthopaed, Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UY, England; [Menezes, Ronald Joseph; Acharya, Prashant Upendra; d'Almeida, Vivian Roshan; Kamath, Ashwin] Father Muller Med Coll, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Mangalore 575002, India",Norfolk & Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Father Muller Medical College,"Mirza, K (corresponding author), Norfolk & Norwich Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Trauma & Orthopaed, Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UY, England.",kiyana.mirza@gmail.com; ronaldjmenezes@gmail.com; prashantach@gmail.com; joseaustine10@gmail.com; v.dal1981@gmail.com; dr.ashwinkamath@gmail.com,,"Acharya, Prashant/0009-0009-0765-6583; Austine, Jose/0000-0003-0197-394X; Mirza, Kiyana/0000-0002-2971-9153",,,,,29,5,5,0,0,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1633-8065,1432-1068,,EUR J ORTHOP SURG TR,Eur.

ACL reconstruction has been recognized as the most common procedure to restore knee stability. One of the main drawbacks of standard implant is that the medical costs incurred are often beyond the reach of most patients, so patients who need ACL reconstruction surgery must find other financially affordable alternatives. Due to the many knee joint complications involving patellar and hamstring tendon grafts in ACL reconstruction, the new proposed solution is anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This research was an analytical study with a cross-sectional observational design. The sample in this study compared patients diagnosed with ACL rupture who received ACL reconstruction treatment using a modified implant with a hamstring tendon autograft and a peroneus longus tendon autograft. The sample was examined using the consecutive sampling technique by tracing medical record data, used as secondary data, and through the distribution of the Lysholm Knee and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring questionnaires. RESULTS: Out of 69 samples that met the inclusion criteria, 45 were hamstring autograft samples, and 24 were peroneus autograft samples. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of Lysholm Knee Score (P=0.135), International Knee Documentation CONCLUSIONS: The hamstring autograft and peroneus autograft groups did not show a significant difference in clinical functional outcomes after ACL reconstruction with the modified implant technique.

Several growth factors, cytokine, chemokine, and protease inhibitors functions in stimulation of paracrine reactions in fibroblast, endothelial, and stem cells thereby promoting the tissue restorative processes. Augmented with dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft reinforces the reconstructed ligament and aids in effective restoration. Materials and methods: In this case control study 15 patients undertaking ACL reconstruction with tripled peroneus augmented dHACM (G1) were prospectively monitored up for a period of 8 months along with 15 control patients (G2) without dHACM augmentation. Clinical and radiological outcomes were analysed and assessed about effect of augmenting the peroneus longus graft using dHACM. Clinical analysis included pre-operative two, four, six, and eight months post-operative Tegnor-Lysholm score, and radiological analysis included the 6th month postoperative MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements by mean signal-value at femoral insertion, midsubstance and tibial insertion of ACL graft. Results: Clinically, as a mean Lysholm score of all patients, they were revealed to be consecutively high in G1 than in Group 2 at four, six, and eight months. The signal-to-noise ratio from the MRI results showed majority having good healing in G1 group. Conclusions: Based on 6-month MRI, an effective ligamentization (SNR<75) was noticed in 53.33% of patients in the dHACM allograft enhanced group on comparison with 33% in the controls. The overall results show that the augmentation of dHACM allograft to ACL reconstruction yields in good patient outcomes at post-operative follow-up.","[Tonape, P.

Hamstring tendon (HT) is the most popular graft for ACL reconstruction. In certain patient, particularly in women, the size of tendon graft to reconstruct the ACL is unpredictable. In the case of unqualified donor, we need a combined graft from another source to match the size requirement. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of ACL reconstruction using combination of HT and PLT graft in adolescent female. We evaluate knee functional score and ankle donor site morbidity. In the second case we also did second look for the ACL graft integrity arthroscopically. This study has been reported in line with the Surgical Case Report (SCARE) criteria. DISCUSSION: One year after surgery, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score for both cases were improved and no ankle-donor site morbidity with good motoric power and 100% American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Score (AOFAS). CONCLUSION: Additional peroneus longus tendon can be considered as an alternative in undersized hamstring tendon graft without significant donor site morbidity. (C) 2020 The Authors.

This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. Materials and methods: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three-and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. Results: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals. Conclusion: The static and dynamic balance, which is impaired after ACL injury, improves with ACL reconstruction with PLT autologous graft. Hence PLTG can be safely used as a graft for ACL reconstruction without affecting postural control and body balance.","[Sahoo, P.

Recently, it is designated as a promising graft option for ACLR. The effect of harvesting PLTG on donor ankle function is still not completely understood. Peroneus Longus Tendon (PLT) is thought to play a major role in proprioceptive regulation of the ankle joint. All the studies till date did cross-sectional assessments of ankle and foot function at or after 6 months that might have overlooked the timely detection of donor site morbidities. Aim: To evaluate the ankle function and compare the affected and sound limb function in subjects with an ACLR with autologous PLTG starting at an early postoperative visit upto six months. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary rehabilitation centre from March 2019 to March 2021 including the follow-up evaluation. As per the inclusion criteria, 63 participants after ACLR with PLTG were considered for assessment using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle and hind foot scale and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) scale at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-ACLR follow-up. Comparison between sound and affected limbs was done during all follow-ups. The statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. Both FAAM and AOFAS ankle and foot scores were analysed with non parametric tests. Results: Mean age of 63 participants were 29.25 years. Median of AOFAS and FAAM score at 6 week, 3 month, and 6 month post-ACLR follow-ups were (88, 98 and 100) and (97.22, 98.80 and 100), respectively. Statistically significant increase in AOFAS and FAAM scores were observed at 3 month and 6 month as compared to 6 week follow-ups with p=0.001 and p-value=0.001 respectively. The group comparison between the affected and sound side functional scores at different study visits showed statistically significant greater values for the sound ankle than the affected ankle (FAAM: 6 week: p-value=0.001; 3 month: p-value=0.001; 6 month: p-value=0.001 and AOFAS p-value=0.001; p-value=0.001; p-value=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The evaluation of functional outcomes showed gradual and linear improvement at subsequent postoperative visits and restores fully to 100% at 6 month indicating a near-normal to normal donor ankle function following ACLR with PLTG by 6 months. The group comparison showed only marginal but significant difference between affected and sound ankle function.","[Sahu, Mamata Manjari; Mohanty, Patitapaban] Swami Vivekananda Natl Inst Rehabil Training & Re, Dept Physiotherapy, Cuttack, Odisha, India; [Pragassame, Arul S.] Annamalai Univ, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Raja Muthiah Med Coll & Hosp, Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India; [Sahoo, Pabitra Kumar] Swami Vivekananda Natl Inst Rehabil Training & Re, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Cuttack, Odisha, India",Annamalai University,"Sahu, MM (corresponding author), Swami Vivekananda Natl Inst Rehabil Training & Re, Dept Physiotherapy, Cuttack, Odisha, India.",mamata1803@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,4,5,0,1,PREMCHAND SHANTIDEVI RESEARCH FOUNDATION,DELHI,"71 JAIN COLONY, VEER NAGAR, DELHI, 110 007, INDIA",2249-782X,0973-709X,,J CLIN DIAGN RES,J.

Functional analysis was done using the Tegner-Lysholm score pre-operatively, at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postoperatively. At terminal follow-up, stability was checked clinically by Lachman test, residual morbidity of donor site was assessed using foot and ankle disability index, and radio-graphic correlation was done with magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The mean diameter of the graft after tripling was 9 +/- 0.71 mm and the average length before tripling was found to be 27.07 +/- 2.76 cms. At terminal follow-up, 101 patients showed excellent, while 12 patients showed good outcomes. The mean foot and ankle disability index was 94.8 +/- 3. 90.27% of patients had no laxity on clinical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging of all the patients at terminal follow-up showed good graft uptake. Conclusions: Peroneus longus autograft shows intraoperative consistency and gives excellent functional outcome, clinical stability, and no donor site morbidity even three years postoperatively.","[Rajani, Amyn M.; Shah, Urvil A.; Mittal, Anmol R.

Methods: Thirty patients with complete ACL tears were operated on. In all these patients, the thickness or length of the hamstring graft taken was found to be inadequate (less than 8 mm and 7.5 cm, respectively). So, additionally, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) graft was harvested to reach an optimum size of the final graft. Functional outcome was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at six weeks, three months, and six months. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score at six months was used to assess ankle stability. Results: The mean age in our study was 28.8 years with male predominance (73.33%). The mean operative time was 86.4 minutes. The mean hamstring graft thickness in our study was 6.5 mm, which improved to 9.12 mm after augmentation. The mean graft length after AHPLT augmentation was 9.38 cm. The mean IKDC score at six months was 87.35. At the end of six months, FADI scores were found within normal limits (range: 135-136) in all the patients. No complications were noted in any of the patients. Conclusion: The AHPLT graft was always found to be sufficient enough for augmenting the hamstring graft to reach an acceptable thickness and length. There was no graft site morbidity and the ankle functional levels remained the same as preoperative levels, making it an excellent choice for augmentation of inadequate hamstring grafts.","[Singh, Harpreet; Agarwal, Kamal Kumar; Tyagi, Sangam; Bhrambhatt, Purvesh; Rampurwala, Ammar; Unjia, Rishit; Agarwal, Neel] Geetanjali Med Coll & Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India",,"Bhrambhatt, P (corresponding author), Geetanjali Med Coll & Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India.",purvesh.002@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,1,4,0,1,CUREUS INC,PALO ALTO,"PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA",,2168-8184,,CUREUS J MED SCIENCE,Cureus J Med Sci,OCT 10,2022,14,10,,,,,,,e30138,10.7759/cureus.30138,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.30138,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),General & Internal Medicine,E9FP0,36381718,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:000978517400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is becoming more and more common in the knee surgery due to the annual increase in the number of primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. Choosing the most suitable graft and determining the staging of the surgical treatment by preoperative assessment of the possibility of performing the most anatomical revision canals and their interposition with the primary canals are the main factors that influence treatment results. Aim of the study - comparative assessment of the results of using hamstring tendon and peroneus longus tendon autografts in a one -stage revision reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods. A retrospective analysis of the medical records of 36 patients who underwent revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed. The patients were divided into two groups: in the patients of the study group (n = 19) a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft was used, in the comparison group (n = 17) a hamstring tendon autograft (HT) was applied. Subjective and objective evaluation using the KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm scales was performed, and position of the central entry points of the primary and revision canals was determined. There were no statistically significant differences in the objective assessment of the knee joint stability. Significantly better results of subjective assessment of the knee function according to the Lysholm and KOOS scales were obtained in the PLT group (p = 0.042 and p<0.001, respectively). Position of revision canals corresponded to the standard values, but position of the femoral canal had a slight cranial and anterior displacement. It was also found that the PLT graft diameter was statistically significantly larger than the HT graft diameter (p<0.001). Results. There were no statistically significant differences in the objective assessment of the knee joint stability. Significantly better results of subjective assessment of the knee function according to the Lysholm and KOOS scales were obtained in the PLT group (p = 0.042 and p<0.001, respectively). Position of revision canals corresponded to the standard values, but position of the femoral canal had a slight cranial and anterior displacement. It was also found that the PLT graft diameter was statistically significantly larger than the HT graft diameter (p<0.001). Conclusion. One -stage revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a safe and effective surgical procedure providing satisfactory objective and subjective clinical results. Use of peroneus longus tendon autograft allows to obtain better results in comparison with the hamstring tendon autograft.","[Gofer, Anton S.; Alekperov, Aleksandr A.; Gurazhev, Mikhail B.; Avdeev, Artem K.; Lukinov, Vitaly L.; Rubtsov, Dmitriy V.; Pavlov, Vitaliy V.] Tsivyan Novosibirsk Res Inst Traumatol & Orthopaed, Novosibirsk, Russia",,"Gofer, AS (corresponding author), Tsivyan Novosibirsk Res Inst Traumatol & Orthopaed, Novosibirsk, Russia.",a.hofer.ortho@gmail.com; alecperov@mail.ru; tashtagol@inbox.ru; avdeev.artiom@mail.ru; vitaliy.lukinov@gmail.com; rubic.dv@yandex.ru; pavlovdoc@mail.ru,"; Gofer, Anton/MAI-0607-2025","Gurazhev, Mikhail/0000-0002-6398-9413; Gofer, Anton/0009-0000-3886-163X",,,,,34,1,1,0,1,VREDEN RUSSIAN RESEARCH INST TRAUMATOLOGY & ORTHOPEDICS,ST PETERSBURG,"UL AK BAIKOVA, DOM 8, ST PETERSBURG, 195427, RUSSIA",2311-2905,,,TRAVMATOL ORTOP ROSS,Travmatol.

This study aimed to present a reinforcing method with additional half peroneus longus tendon (half-PLT) graft augmentation. Methods Eight cases underwent ACL reconstruction with unqualified hamstring tendon grafts (diameter < 7 mm) and were salvaged by additional half-PLT graft augmentation. The pivot shift test and KT-1000 tests were performed 3 years after surgery. Functional evaluation of subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores was also done. In addition, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were used to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Results The diameter of unqualified four-strand hamstring tendon grafts was 6.2 mm on average (range, 6.0-6.5 mm). The average diameter of hamstring grafts with half-PLT augmentation was 9.6 mm (range, 9.5-10.0 mm). The pivot shift test was negative in all patients. No significant differences between normal and abnormal knees were found by KT-1000. The average IKDC score was 86.0 (range, 83 to 89), and the average Lysholm score was 84.4 (range, 80-90). The average FADI score for the donor sites of half-PLT was 135.8 (range, 134-136).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 +/- 6.73, and 29.6 +/- 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision. Allograft ACL reconstruction is a good alternative to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon graft.","[Ertogrul, R.] Surp Pirgic Private Hosp, Orthopaed Surg & Traumatolohy Dept, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kilinc, B.

We retrospectively analyzed the data of 156 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with the PLT graft at our institution. Anthropometric parameters, including height, weight, gender, age, duration of injury, and preinjury activity levels, were recorded. t tests, correlation coefficients (Pearson r), and a multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter of the graft obtained. The mean PLT graft diameter was 8.3mm, and 21 patients (13.5%) had a diameter less than 8 mm; 85 patients (54.5%) had a diameter between 8 and 9mm, and 50 patients (32.0%) had a diameter greater than or equal to 9 mm. The correlation analysis showed that height (P<.001), weight (P<.001), and duration of injury (P=.012) were significantly related to graft diameter. On the basis of these 3 predictors, the following regression equation was obtained: Diameter=2.28+0.028*height (cm)+0.013*weight (kg)+0.289*duration of injury (0 or 1). Patients who were short and shin were more likely to own smaller graft diameters (<8mm), especially the one ruptured his or her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) over 3 months. Height, weight, and duration of injury were associated with the diameter of PLT. They are important preoperative information for surgeon about the size of PLT and can be used for alternative graft source planning and patient counseling.","[Song, Xiaoxiao; Li, Qiangqiang; Wu, Zongfang; Xu, Qian; Chen, Dongyang; Jiang, Qing] Drum Tower Hosp, Dept Sports Med & Adult Reconstruct Surg, Sch Med, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Qiangqiang; Wu, Zongfang] Nanjing Med Univ, Dept Sports Med & Adult Reconstruct Surg, Drum Tower Hosp, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dongyang; Jiang, Qing] Nanjing Univ, Model Anim Res Ctr, Lab Bone & Joint Dis, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Nanjing Medical University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University,"Jiang, Q (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Drum Tower Hosp, Med Sch, Ctr Diag & Treatment Joint Dis, Zhongshan Rd 321, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Chen, DY (corresponding author), Zhongshan Rd 321, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",28617621@qq.com; qingj@nju.edu.cn,"Chen, Dongyang/AFQ-0269-2022; Jiang, Qing/JXM-6827-2024",,Projects of International Cooperation and Exchanges NSFC [81420108021]; National Key Technology Support Program [2015BAI08B02]; Excellent Young Scholars NSFC [81622033]; Jiangsu Provincial Key Medical Center Foundation; Jiangsu Provincial Medical Talent Foundation; Jiangsu Provincial Medical Outstanding Talent Foundation,Projects of International Cooperation and Exchanges NSFC; National Key Technology Support Program(National Key Technology R&D Program); Excellent Young Scholars NSFC; Jiangsu Provincial Key Medical Center Foundation; Jiangsu Provincial Medical Talent Foundation; Jiangsu Provincial Medical Outstanding Talent Foundation,"This work was supported by the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchanges NSFC (81420108021), National Key Technology Support Program (2015BAI08B02), Excellent Young Scholars NSFC (81622033), Jiangsu Provincial Key Medical Center Foundation, Jiangsu Provincial Medical Talent Foundation, and Jiangsu Provincial Medical Outstanding Talent Foundation.",,36,23,30,0,7,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),NOV,2018,97,44,,,,,,,e12672,10.1097/MD.0000000000012672,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000012672,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HD3UC,30383628,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:000452445900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. Results: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 +/- 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .55), with means of 65.87 +/- 7.63 N and 66.96 +/- 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .68), with means of 150.64 +/- 11.67 N and 152.10 +/- 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 +/- 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 +/- 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. Conclusion: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity. This suggests that the peroneus longus tendon is a promising graft in ACL reconstruction.","[Rhatomy, Sholahuddin; Wicaksono, Fidelis H.; Soekarno, Noha Roshadiansyah; Setyawan, Riky; Primasara, Shinta; Budhiparama, Nicolaas C.] Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Klaten, Indonesia; [Rhatomy, Sholahuddin] Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, KRT Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro St 1, Klaten 57424, Central Java, Indonesia; [Rhatomy, Sholahuddin] Gadjah Mada Univ, Fac Med Publ Hlth & Nursing, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Wicaksono, Fidelis H.; Soekarno, Noha Roshadiansyah; Setyawan, Riky] Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Soeradji Tirtonegoro Sport Ctr, Klaten, Indonesia; [Wicaksono, Fidelis H.; Soekarno, Noha Roshadiansyah; Setyawan, Riky] Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Res Unit, Klaten, Indonesia; [Primasara, Shinta] Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Klaten, Indonesia; [Budhiparama, Nicolaas C.] Nicolaas Inst Construct Orthopaed Res & Educ Fdn, Jakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University,"Rhatomy, S (corresponding author), Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, KRT Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro St 1, Klaten 57424, Central Java, Indonesia.",doktergustomrhatomy@yahoo.com,"; rhatomy, sholahuddin/U-6158-2019","Budhiparama, Nicolaas Cyrillus/0000-0002-0801-7400; rhatomy, sholahuddin/0000-0002-5512-6706",,,,,18,36,50,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,2325-9671,,ORTHOP J SPORTS MED,Orthop.

Methods The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. Results A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18-20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group. Conclusions PL tendon autograft can be used as a safe and effective autograft choice for ACLR with excellent functional outcomes comparable to HST tendon autograft and minimal donor site morbidity.","[Khalil, Mohamed Hussein; Zawam, Sherif Hamdy] Cairo Univ Hosp, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Cairo University Hospital,"Khalil, MH (corresponding author), Cairo Univ Hosp, Cairo, Egypt.",mohamedhussein1980@gmail.com; sherif88@kasralainy.edu.eg,,"khalil, mohamed/0000-0002-6746-7399","Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)","Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF)(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)(Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB))","Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).",,25,3,3,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0341-2695,1432-5195,,INT ORTHOP,Int.

Nowadays, peroneus longus is used in ACL reconstruction. However, it is difficult to predict the peroneus longus graft diameter for ACL reconstruction. Thus, preoperative measurements are very important to predict peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction. Methods: A cohort retrospective study was conducted using consecutive sampling method from February 2016 until October 2017 in our center. We recorded patients' characteristics include gender, age, body weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) preoperatively. We measured peroneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively, and analysed data using Spearman correlation. Results: Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. There were 28 males and 11 females in the peroneus group. From the patients' mean characteristics, age was 25.10 +/- 9.16, body weight 71.23 +/- 14.17, height 169.13 +/- 8.81, and BMI 20.96 +/- 3.44. Intraoperative peroneus longus diameter measurement was 8.56 +/- 0.82. Spearman correlation showed significant correlation between intraoperative peroneus longus diameter with patient's height, body weight, and BMI with p < 0.05. Conclusion: Patients' characteristics including gender, height, weight, and BMI in preoperative measurements can predict peoneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively.","[Rhatomy, Sholahuddin] Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Klaten, Indonesia; [Tanzil, Henry; Setyawan, Riky] Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Soeradji Tirtonegoro Sport Ctr, Klaten, Indonesia; [Tanzil, Henry; Setyawan, Riky] Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Res Unit, Klaten, Indonesia; [Rhatomy, Sholahuddin; Setyawan, Riky; Amanda, Camilla; Rukmoyo, Tedjo] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Med Publ Hlth & Nursing, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Phatama, Krisna Yuarno] Dr Saiful Anwar Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Malang, Indonesia; [Phatama, Krisna Yuarno] Univ Brawijaya, Fac Med, Malang, Indonesia; [Andrianus, Jeffrey] Dr Soetomo Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Andrianus, Jeffrey] Univ Airlangga, Fac Med, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Rukmoyo, Tedjo] Dr Sardjito Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Kisworo, Bambang] Panti Rapih Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University; Brawijaya University; Dr Soetomo General Hospital Surabaya; Airlangga University,"Rhatomy, S (corresponding author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Med Publ Hlth & Nursing, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.;Rhatomy, S (corresponding author), Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Hosp, Sport & Adult Reconstruct Div, Orthopaed & Traumatol Dept, Klaten, Indonesia.",doktergustomrhatomy@yahoo.com,"Phatama, Krisna Yuarno/ABA-6317-2021; rhatomy, sholahuddin/U-6158-2019","Phatama, Krisna Yuarno/0000-0003-1050-7561; rhatomy, sholahuddin/0000-0002-5512-6706",,,,,24,11,17,0,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2049-0801,,,ANN MED SURG,Ann.

This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. Material/Methods: ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56 +/- 0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44 +/- 0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46 +/- 3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48 +/- 4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. Conclusions: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain. The peroneus longus tendon, with its larger diameter, fewer graft-related complications, and similar knee scores compared to the hamstring group, is considered a suitable alternative graft source.","[Gok, Bilal; Tutak, Yilmaz] Mardin Training & Res Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Mardin, Turkiye; [Kanar, Muharrem] Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training & Res Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Istanbul, Turkiye",Istanbul Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training & Research Hospital,"G”k, B (corresponding author), Mardin Training & Res Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Mardin, Turkiye.",dr.bilalgok@hotmail.com,"Kanar, Muharrem/IAM-6081-2023",,,,,,35,4,4,4,5,"INT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, INC",MELVILLE,"150 BROADHOLLOW RD, STE 114, MELVILLE, NY 11747 USA",,1643-3750,,MED SCI MONITOR,Med.

The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. Results: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24-31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P < 0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. Conclusion: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be an appropriate autograft for ACLR due to its strength, larger graft diameter, and avoiding potential complications of hamstring autograft obtained from the knee region.

Methods: The study included 29 patients (27 males, 2 females; mean age-30 years; range 21 to 39 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft and interference nail fixation. Fourteen patients (48.3%) also had partial meniscectomy during surgery. The results were assessed according to the Lysholm scores and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale at the end of at least five years of follow-up. Results: According to the IKDC scale, 17 patients (58.6%) were rated as normal or nearly normal, and 12 patients (41.4%) were rated as abnormal or severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm score was 83.7 (range 45 to 100), with excellent or good results in 23 patients (79.3%). Radiographic examination showed mild (n=10) or moderate (n=1) degenerative changes in the knee joint. Compared with the normal side, no flexion or extension losses occurred in the affected knees. Stability of the ACL was assessed by the Lachman test, which showed normal findings in 12 patients (41.4%), while nine patients had 1+, five patients had 2+, and three patients had 3+ anteroposterior laxity. Pivot-shift test was negative in 13 patients (44.8%); ten patients had 1+ pivot glide, and six patients had 2+ pivot shift. Two patients (6.9%) complained of mild to moderate pressure pain, paresthesia and dysesthesia at the donor site of PLT. No patient experienced ankle joint dysfunction or difficulty in sports activities due to PLT graft transfer.

Anthropometric measurements were recorded, including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), fibular length, calf circumference, and ankle circumference. The Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) was used to assess activity levels. PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured using ultrasonography. Two-stranded PLT graft thickness was calculated using the previously reported formula by Luo et al. A thickness of less than 8 mm of PLT graft was accepted as an insufficient autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of two-stranded PLT graft thickness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to establish the best threshold values. Results Males had a significantly greater PLT CSA (0.17 +/- 0.03 cm(2)) and predicted two-stranded PLT graft thickness (8.1 +/- 0.6 mm) compared with females (0.15 +/- 0.03 cm(2) and 7.5 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Correlation analysis revealed that two-stranded PLT graft thickness positively correlated with height, weight, BMI, fibular length, calf circumference, ankle circumference, and Tegner Activity Scale in both genders, with stronger correlations observed in females. The logistic regression model identified height and calf circumference as significant predictors of sufficient two-stranded PLT graft thickness (>= 8 mm) in males, while calf circumference and the TAS were significant predictors in females. ROC analysis demonstrated that calf circumference and the TAS had acceptable discriminatory abilities in females, with 36.25 cm and >= 4 cutoff points, respectively. However, no anthropometric variables in males exhibited strong discriminatory abilities for predicting two-stranded PLT graft thickness Conclusions Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females. However, no anthropometric variables in males could be used strongly for prediction. These anthropometric measurements can assist in preoperative planning and decision-making, potentially improving ACLR outcomes by ensuring adequate graft thickness in females.Level of evidence: Level II prospective study Conclusions Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females.

Hypothesis: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction yields better results on biomechanical testing, radiographic analysis, and histological evaluation versus using a hybrid graft. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 66 adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction with an autograft (AT group; n = 33) or a hybrid graft (HB group; n = 33). The grafts used in both groups were harvested from the peroneus longus tendon and were fixed by suturing to the surrounding periosteum. Samples were harvested for biomechanical testing, micro-computed tomography (CT), and histological evaluation at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Bone tunnels on the femoral and tibial sides were divided into 3 subregions: intra-articular (IA), midtunnel (MT), and extra-articular (EA). A cylinder-like volume of interest in the bone tunnel and a tubular-like volume of interest around the bone tunnel were used to evaluate new bone formation and bone remodeling, respectively, via micro-CT. Results: In the AT group, there were significantly higher failure loads and stiffness at 8 weeks (failure load: 3.04 +/- 0.40 vs 2.09 +/- 0.54 N, respectively; P = .006) (stiffness: 3.43 +/- 0.56 vs 1.75 +/- 0.52 N/mm, respectively; P < .001) and 12 weeks (failure load: 9.10 +/- 1.13 vs 7.14 +/- 0.94 N, respectively; P = .008) (stiffness: 4.45 +/- 0.75 vs 3.36 +/- 0.29 N/mm, respectively; P = .008) than in the HB group. With regard to new bone formation in the bone tunnel, in the AT group, the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher than in the HB group on the tibial side at 8 weeks (IA: 22.21 +/- 4.98 vs 5.16 +/- 3.98, respectively; P < .001) (EA: 19.66 +/- 7.19 vs 10.85 +/- 2.16, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 30.50 +/- 5.04 vs 17.11 +/- 7.31, respectively; P = .010) (MT: 21.15 +/- 2.58 vs 15.55 +/- 4.48, respectively; P = .041) (EA: 20.75 +/- 3.87 vs 10.64 +/- 3.94, respectively; P = .003). With regard to bone remodeling around the tunnel, the BV/TV was also significantly higher on the tibial side at 8 weeks (MT: 33.17 +/- 8.05 vs 15.21 +/- 7.60, respectively; P = .007) (EA: 25.19 +/- 6.38 vs 13.94 +/- 7.10, respectively; P = .030) and 12 weeks (IA: 69.46 +/- 4.45 vs 47.80 +/- 6.16, respectively; P < .001) (MT: 33.15 +/- 3.88 vs 13.76 +/- 4.07, respectively; P < .001) in the AT group than in the HB group. Sharpey-like fibers had formed at 8 weeks in the AT group. A large number of fibroblasts withdrew at 12 weeks. In the AT group, the width of the interface was significantly narrower at 4 weeks (85.86 +/- 17.49 vs 182.97 +/- 14.35 mu m, respectively; P < .001), 8 weeks (58.86 +/- 10.99 vs 90.15 +/- 11.53 mu m, respectively; P = .002), and 12 weeks (42.70 +/- 7.96 vs 67.29 +/- 6.55 mu m, respectively; P = .001) than in the HB group. Conclusion: Using an autograft for ACL reconstruction may result in improved biomechanical properties and tendon-bone incorporation compared with a hybrid graft.","[Wang, Hong-De; Wang, Tian-Rui; Wang, Juan; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Ying-Ze] Hebei Med Univ, Hosp 3, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 139 Ziqiang Rd, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hong-De; Wang, Tian-Rui; Wang, Juan; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Ying-Ze] Key Lab Biomech Hebei Prov, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hong-De; Wang, Tian-Rui; Wang, Juan; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Ying-Ze] Hebei Med Univ, Hosp 3, NHC Key Lab Intelligent Orthopaed Equipment, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hong-De; Wang, Tian-Rui; Sui, Yao] Hebei Med Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tian-Rui] Qingdao Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Sui, Yao] Hebei Med Univ, Hosp 2, Dept Ophthalmol, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ying-Ze] Chinese Acad Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hebei Medical University; Hebei Medical University; Hebei Medical University; Qingdao University; Hebei Medical University,"Zhang, YZ (corresponding author), Hebei Med Univ, Hosp 3, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 139 Ziqiang Rd, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China.",profyzzhang@126.com,"Chen, Wei/GRX-2231-2022; Zhang, Cheng/JAD-2236-2023","Chen, Wei/0000-0001-5451-6430;",,,,,56,14,16,2,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Methods: Eight matched pairs of peroneus longus tendons were prepared according to a quadrupled, all-inside ACL soft-tissue graft technique with 1 side serving as a control and the contralateral side supplemented. The constructs were biomechanically tested for strain in the inner and outer limbs during a preconditioning protocol, single-cycle load to failure, and elongation of the whole construct. Results: Ultimate load to failure was significantly higher in the supplemented group: 797.5 +/- 49.6 N (95% confidence interval [CI], 763.13-831.87 N) versus 719.6 +/- 69.6 N (95% CI, 671.38-767.82 N; P = .044).

The purpose of this study was to compare revision rate and patient-reported outcomes following primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft versus a preoperatively planned hybrid autograft-allograft. At a minimum 2-year follow-up, patients who had undergone primary ACLR with a double-stranded semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring autograft (A) or a planned hybrid (H) graft (single-strand semitendinosus with nonirradiated peroneus longus or tibialis posterior allograft) were contacted to fill out a survey containing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) for activity level prior to injury and at follow-up. From this collection of patients, a matched-pair comparison was made between groups, with patients matched by gender, age at the time of surgery, and follow-up time. Revision rate at follow-up was 8.4 and 2.4% in the A and H groups, respectively (p = 0.073). A total of 148 surveys were completed (83 A, 65 H), from which 36 matched pairs were formed. Within the matched pairs, average age at surgery did not differ significantly between groups (A: 35.7 years, H: 36.0 years, p = 0.23). Time to follow-up was 4.3 and 3.7 years in the A and H groups, respectively. Patients with a hybrid graft had significantly higher KOOS Quality of Life subscores (A 69.6, H 79.2, p = 0.028), subjective IKDC scores (A 72.6, H 79.7, p = 0.031), and SANE scores (A 83.2, H 91.4, p = 0.015) at follow-up. Otherwise, no significant differences were found in patient-reported outcome scores between groups. A preoperatively planned hybrid graft, with use of a fresh-frozen, nonirradiated allograft, should be considered as a viable alternative for primary ACLR in older patients.","[Kraeutler, Matthew J.] Seton Hall Hackensack Meridian Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 400 S Orange Ave, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Kim, Seong H.; Brown, Colin C.; Houck, Darby A.; McCarty, Eric C.] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Dept Orthoped, Aurora, CO USA; [Domby, Brian C.] Florida Med Clin, Dept Orthopaed & Sports Med, Zephyrhills, FL USA; [Reynolds, Kirk A.] Arkansas Specialty Orthopaed, Dept Orthopaed, Little Rock, AR USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus,"Kraeutler, MJ (corresponding author), Seton Hall Hackensack Meridian Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 400 S Orange Ave, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",matthewkraeutlermd@gmail.com,"McCarty, Eric/AAA-1821-2019; Houck, Darby/W-1093-2019; Kraeutler, Matthew/IRZ-1227-2023","McCarty, Eric/0000-0002-8948-5862; Kim, Seong Hwan/0000-0001-5471-5747;",,,,,28,23,24,0,2,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",1538-8506,1938-2480,,J KNEE SURG,J.

Methods: Eighteen fascia lata specimens were harvested from 11 donors and fan folded through a proprietary process. Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus tendons were harvested from 4 additional donors. All soft-tissue grafts were tested to failure in an MTS machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) in a single-looped fashion. BPTB grafts were similarly clamped in freeze grips. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness were calculated for each graft type tested. Results: The mean ultimate load to failure was 3,266 N and stiffness was 414 N/mm for the single-looped fascia lata grafts (n = 18). There was no significant difference for ultimate load to failure and stiffness between the fascia lata and tibialis anterior (3,012 N and 342 N/mm, respectively), tibialis posterior (3,666 N and 392 N/mm, respectively), and peroneus longus (3,050 N and 346 N/mm, respectively) tendons. The fascia lata grafts performed significantly better (P < .001) than BPTB (1,404 N and 224 N/mm, respectively). Conclusions: A single-loop construct of fan-folded fascia lata allograft has, on biomechanical testing, initial ultimate tensile strength (3,266 N) and stiffness values equivalent to or better than several other graft tissues currently used in ACL reconstruction, including BPTB (1,403 N), tibialis anterior (3,012 N), tibialis posterior (3,666 N), and peroneus longus (3,050 N). Clinical Relevance: In the face of potential allograft tissue shortages and increasing constraints on health care expenditures, the use of fascia lata has the potential to be a readily available graft for ACL reconstruction that performs as well as other grafts and at a comparable or lower cost.","[Chan, Daniel B.; Latta, Loren L.; Mahure, Siddharth; Dennis, Jeremy] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Temple, H.

Reconstruction of this ligament with hamstring tendon has been time-tested but peroneus longus autograft is also gaining popularity. However, very limited literature is available comparing the two grafts. This study aims to compare the functional outcome and donor site morbidity between hamstrings and peroneus longus autograft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: A prospective randomised study was conducted on 45 patients, who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Patients were assigned into Hamstring group and the Peroneus longus group. Functional outcome was assessed using Lysholm score and Modified Cincinnati scores for the knee joint and American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Scoring for ankle joint. Donor site morbidity was assessed by measuring flexion and extension strength of the knee and plantar flexion and eversion strength of the ankle by handheld dynamometer preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and I year follow up. Results: Functional outcome of the knee showed significant improvement in peroneus longus group (p-value 0.002) compared to hamstring group. Even though there was minimal reduction in functional outcome of the ankle at 6 months follow-up in peroneus longus group, it improved at one year follow-up. While assessing the donor site morbidity at the knee joint, knee flexion strength showed improvement in the group (p-value 0.02) but reduced in the hamstring group where the hamstring tendon was harvested. Knee extension strength in the hamstring group scored marginally better than the peroneus longus group, which was not statistically significant (p-value 0.5). Conclusion: Autologous peroneus longus tendon can be used as a graft of choice in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction which showed promising results without compromising on the ankle function. Its usage as an alternative source of the graft may be more useful in multi-ligament injuries of the knee joint.","[Vijay, C.; Santosh, M.

The peroneus longus tendon is an upcoming graft with several advantages over traditional autografts. It has minimal donor site morbidity in relation to biomechanical properties of the ankle. Common peroneal nerve injury during harvest is a theoretical concern while harvesting the peroneus longus tendon. The following case highlights the importance of careful surgical technique and timely intervention while dealing with such complications. A 25-year-old male suffered an anterior cruciate ligament rupture while wrestling. He had an unstable knee and difficulty performing daily activities. He underwent an arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. Following surgery, the patient reported a foot drop and decreased sensations over the dorsum of the foot. The patient was advised of a foot drop splint and neuroprotective medications. Neurophysiological studies were not performed since they cannot differentiate between partial and complete nerve injury in the first week after injury. A surgical exploration of the nerve was done. An intraneural hematoma was found with contusions over the peroneus longus tendon. Neurolysis was performed to decompress the nerve. The functioning of the anterior cruciate ligament was satisfactory during follow-up. An advancing Tinel's sign was noted on follow-up. The patient finally recovered after a 3-month follow-up.","[Yadav, Umesh; Devgun, Ashish; Agrawal, Gaurav K.] Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Grad Inst Med Sc, Orthopaed, Rohtak, Haryana, India; [Nemani, Mudit] Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Grad Inst Med Sc, Orthopaed & Trauma, Rohtak, Haryana, India; [Malik, Manmeet] Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Univ Hlth Sci, Post Grad Inst Med Sci, Orthopaed, Rohtak, Haryana, India","Pt.

The over-the-top (OTT) technique offers a single-stage solution by avoiding femoral tunnel drilling. However, its main limitation is the reduced graft diameter, typically between 5.5 and 7 mm, which may be insufficient in revision settings. This Technical Note describes an augmentation of the classic OTT technique using a peroneus longus tendon allograft wrapped around preserved-insertion hamstring tendons, achieving graft diameters exceeding 8 mm. Standard arthroscopic portals are used to prepare a standard tibial tunnel, whereas a lateral femoral approach is performed to prepare the OTT point. Femoral fixation is secured with staples, and a lateral extra-articular tenodesis is performed to enhance rotational stability. This combined intra- and extra-articular reconstruction allows single-stage revision even in the presence of tunnel enlargement, improving biomechanical strength and potentially accelerating biological integration through preservation of the tibial insertion. The described technique offers a reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective option for complex anterior cruciate ligament revisions.","[Perelli, Simone; Ibanez, Maximiliano; Monllau, Joan Carles] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Hosp Univ Dexeus, Inst Catala Traumatol & Med Esport ICATME, Barcelona, Spain; [Perelli, Simone; Monllau, Joan Carles] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Hosp del Mar, Dept Surg & Morphol Sci, Orthopaed Surg Serv, Barcelona, Spain; [Messori, Matteo] ASST Grande Osped Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy; [Duenas, Jesus] Hosp Univ Torrecardenas, Almeria, Spain; [Avalos, Rodolfo Morales] Autonomous Univ Nuevo Leon, Dept Traumatol, Med Serv, Monterrey, Mexico",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University; Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Hospital del Mar; Hospital Torrecardenas; Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon,"Messori, M (corresponding author), Via Monte Leone 6, I-20149 Milan, Italy.",dr.matteo.messori@gmail.com,"Monllau, Joan/AAP-7118-2020; Perelli, Simone/AFS-0758-2022",,,,,,20,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-6287,,,ARTHROSC TEC,Arthrosc.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the peroneus longus tendon used the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has a regeneration potential or not. Twelve patients, who had originally undergone harvesting of the peroneus longus tendon for the primary surgery of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Images of both legs were acquired simultaneously with the use of the scanner's extremity coil, as we aimed to compare harvested peroneus longus tendon with the other leg's peroneus longus tendon (healthy side) for evaluation of the regeneration potential. The average age of the patients was 31 years. There were eight right and four left legs. The average time interval was 52 months between ligament surgery and MRI. In all patients, a varying amount of the regeneration of the peroneus longus tendon was seen on the MRI images. Although the extent of PLT regeneration in proximal sections seemed better than in mid- and distal sections, there was no statistical difference between sections (P = 0.130).

At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups.Results All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P > 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the gait cycle parameters, including the percentage of time in the stance, mid-stance, and push-off phases, as well as foot strike angle and push-off angle (P < 0.05).Conclusion Through our study of the surgical experimental group we have shown that harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon does not affect foot morphology and gait parameters; however, it does impact the gait cycle.","[Zhao, Zhi; Bai, Xinwen; Chen, Yu; Deng, Yu] Chongqing Orthoped Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Sport Med, Chongqing 400012, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yu] Chongqing Orthoped Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Postdoctoral Res Workstn, Chongqing 400012, Peoples R China; [Tang, Li; Chen, Jing] Chongqing Rongzhi Biotechnol Co Ltd, Chongqing 400012, Peoples R China; [Ng, Liqi] UCL, Royal Natl Orthopaed Hosp, Inst Orthopaed & Musculoskeletal Sci, London HA7 4LP, England",University of London; University College London; Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust,"Deng, Y (corresponding author), Chongqing Orthoped Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Sport Med, Chongqing 400012, Peoples R China.;Zhou, Y (corresponding author), Chongqing Orthoped Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Postdoctoral Res Workstn, Chongqing 400012, Peoples R China.",Zyhenry123@163.com; dengyu1984@sohu.com,"Zhou, Yu/HLW-4073-2023","Zhou, Yu/0000-0002-3065-4625",Chongqing Yuzhong District Science and Technology Bureau Project; [20210151],Chongqing Yuzhong District Science and Technology Bureau Project;,"The authors would like to thank the Chongqing Yuzhong District Science and Technology Bureau Project (Grant No.20210151), for financial support.",,45,4,6,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1749-799X,,,J ORTHOP SURG RES,J.

Neglected injuries have a direct impact on the prognosis due to residual instability, chronic pain, deformities, and failure to repair other structures. Several techniques are used to reconstruct the posterolateral corner, often with autologous ischiotibial grafts or homologous grafts. An option little used for knee ligament reconstructions is the peroneus longus tendon graft. Although reported as a good alternative for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, we found no case using a peroneus longus tendon graft for posterolateral corner reconstruction. Here, we describe the case of a patient who underwent a non-anatomical reconstruction of the posterolateral corner using a peroneus longus tendon graft. The patient underwent surgical procedures for ligament reconstruction and correction of the deformity caused by a failed graft, but his knee remained unstable. During the preoperative planning, it was decided to reconstruct the posterolateral corner with an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft. Studies have shown that the peroneus longus tendon graft does not increase ankle morbidity, and that its length and diameter favor ligament reconstruction. Thus, the present article highlights the importance of the proper diagnosis of ligament injuries in the acute phase, and describes a new technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction that must be included in the surgeon's body of knowledge, increasing the amount of technical options.","[de Oliveira, Diego Escudeiro; Horita, Melanie Mayumi; Salas, Victor Eduardo Roman; Severino, Fabricio Roberto; Guglielmetti, Luiz Gabriel Betoni; Jorge, Pedro Baches] Irmandade Santa Casa Misericordia Sao Paulo, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Sports Trauma Grp, R Dr Cesario Mota Junior,112 Vila Buarque, BR-01221020 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",,"Horita, MM (corresponding author), Irmandade Santa Casa Misericordia Sao Paulo, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Sports Trauma Grp, R Dr Cesario Mota Junior,112 Vila Buarque, BR-01221020 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",melmayumi.horita@gmail.com,"Jorge, Pedro/OVY-8148-2025","Escudeiro, Diego/0000-0002-7221-6711; Baches Jorge, Peo/0000-0002-4444-4004; Roman Salas, Victor Eduardo/0000-0003-2475-0714; Severino, Fabricio/0000-0002-6834-8615",,,,,7,2,2,0,0,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"Oswald-Hesse-Strasse 50, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0102-3616,1982-4378,,REV BRAS ORTOP,Rev.

A preload of 10 N was then applied and, after it had reached steady state, the allografts were pulled at 4 cm/sec. The parameters recorded were the displacement and force. Results: The elongation at the peak load was 10.3 +/- 2.3 mm for the PB NI side and 13.5 +/- 3.3 mm for the PB IR side. The elongation at the peak load was 17.4 +/- 5.3 mm for the PL NI side and 16.3 +/- 2.0 mm for the PL IR side. For PL, the ultimate load was 2,091.6 +/- 148.7 N for NI and 2,122.8 +/- 380.0 N for IR. The ultimate load for the PB tendons was 1,485.7 +/- 209.3 N for NI and 1,318.4 +/- 296.9 N for the IR group. The ultimate stress calculations for PL were 90.3 +/- 11.3 MPa for NI and 94.8 +/- 21.0 MPa for IR. For the PB, the ultimate stress was 82.4 +/- 19.0 MPa for NI and 72.5 +/- 16.6 MPa for the IR group. The structural stiffness was 216.1 +/- 59.0 N/mm for the NI PL and 195.7 +/- 51.4 N/mm for the IR side. None of these measures were significantly different between the NI and IR groups. The structural stiffness was 232.1 +/- 45.7 N/mm for the NI PB and 161.9 +/- 74.0 N/mm for the IR side, and this was the only statistically significant difference found in this study (P=0.034). Conclusion: Our statistical comparisons found no significant differences in terms of elongation, ultimate load, or ultimate stress between IR and NI PB and PL tendons. Only the PB structural stiffness was affected by irradiation. Thus, sterilizing allografts at 1.5-2.5 Mrad of gamma irradiation does not cause major alterations in the tendons' biomechanical properties while still providing a suitable amount of sterilization for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.","[Aguila, Christopher M.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Delcroix, Gaetan J-R; Latta, Loren L.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Delcroix, Gaetan J-R] Bruce W Carter Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, Miami, FL USA; [Delcroix, Gaetan J-R] Bruce W Carter Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Geriatr Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Miami, FL USA; [Delcroix, Gaetan J-R] Univ Miami, Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Inst, Miami, FL USA; [Delcroix, Gaetan J-R; Temple, H.

There is very little literature on it. Hence, our study aims to compare the functional outcomes, knee stability, donor site morbidity, and assessment of thigh muscle wasting in patients with ACL injury managed by arthroscopic single bundle reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendons (HT), respectively.Methods All adults aged 16-50 years of either gender presenting with symptoms of symptomatic ACL deficiency were admitted for arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR and allocated into two groups (peroneus longus and hamstring tendon). Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm score), clinical knee evaluation (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift test), donor site morbidity (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score (AOFAS)), and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively and at six months and one year postoperatively. The same post-op rehabilitation protocol was followed in both groups.Results One hundred and ninety-four patients (hamstring n = 96, peroneus n = 98) met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences between the preoperative, six-month postoperative, and one-year postoperative scores between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (p=0.356) and Lysholm knee score (p=0.289). The mean for the AOFAS was 99.05 +/- 3.56 and 99.80 +/- 0.70 in the PLT and HT groups, respectively, showing no statistical difference, with a significant improvement in thigh muscle wasting among the PLT group at final follow-up (p < 0.001).Conclusion We observed similar knee stability and functional outcomes and no obvious donor site morbidity among both groups. These patients also had better responses to physiotherapy in recovering from their thigh muscle wasting. So, we can recommend that a PL graft can be a safe, viable, and effective option for usual arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction.","[Agarwal, Abhishek] King Georges Med Univ, Sports Med, Lucknow, India; [Singh, Shitanshu; Singh, Arpit; Tewari, Prakash] King Georges Med Univ, Orthopaed Surg, Lucknow, India",King George's Medical University; King George's Medical University,"Agarwal, A (corresponding author), King Georges Med Univ, Sports Med, Lucknow, India.",abhishekagarwalortho@gmail.com,"Singh, Arpit/JCP-3044-2023",,,,,,20,17,23,0,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2168-8184,,CUREUS J MED SCIENCE,Cureus J Med Sci,APR 7,2023,15,4,,,,,,,,10.7759/cureus.37273,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.37273,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),General & Internal Medicine,E8QC1,37168157,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:000978112600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ankle range of motion (ROM) was measured with a smart phone inclonometer application. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the postoperative ankle strength(eversion, plantar flexion) in the donor area and the preoperative period (p=0.6 and p=0.7, respectively) and contralateral healthy side (p=0.6, p=0.6, respectively). Ankle ROM angles (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, inversion) were significantly lower in the post-operative period compared to the preoperative period and contralateral healthy side (p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative AOFAS scores (p=0.2).

This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length >= 1/2 and < 1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). Methods A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump >= 1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump < 1/2) groups (n = 17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. Results In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p < 0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p > 0.05). Conclusion During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length >= 1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length < 1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint.","[Chen, Chunrong; Bei, Chaoyong] Guilin Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Limb Trauma & Hand Surg, 15 Lequn Rd, Guilin 541001, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Jing, Zhang] Guilin Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Clin Teaching & Training Ctr, 15 Lequn Rd,Xiufeng Dist, Guilin 541001, Guangxi Zhuang, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhimin] Guilin Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Spinal Bone Surg, 15 Lequn Rd,Xiufeng Dist, Guilin 541001, Guangxi Zhuang, Peoples R China; [Hu, Minghua; Xin, Linwei] Guilin Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Orthopaed Dept, 212 Renmin Rd,Lingui Dist, Guilin 541199, Guangxi Zhuang, Peoples R China",Guilin Medical University; Guilin Medical University; Guilin Medical University; Guilin Medical University,"Xin, LW (corresponding author), Guilin Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Orthopaed Dept, 212 Renmin Rd,Lingui Dist, Guilin 541199, Guangxi Zhuang, Peoples R China.",ccr10086@163.com; 418868294@qq.com; 379414350@qq.com; 863780607@qq.com; 460526185@qq.com; xinlinwei999888@163.com,"LI, Zhimin/LSK-1360-2024",,"Health Commission Self-Funded Scientific Research Projects of Guangxi, China [Z-C20220835]; Open funds of the Guangxi Key Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Microenvironmental Regulation [2023KF007]","Health Commission Self-Funded Scientific Research Projects of Guangxi, China; Open funds of the Guangxi Key Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Microenvironmental Regulation","This study was supported by The Health Commission Self-Funded Scientific Research Projects of Guangxi, China(No. Z-C20220835) and the Partly supported by the open funds of the Guangxi Key Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Microenvironmental Regulation (No.2023KF007).",,43,0,0,2,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2482,,BMC SURG,BMC Surg.,APR 24,2025,25,1,,,,,,,175,10.1186/s12893-025-02913-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12893-025-02913-w,,,9,Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Surgery,1TZ3D,40269891,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:001473611100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Peroneus longus tendon graft is not a popular first choice for ACL recon-struction. However, newer literature has shown good outcomes with its use. This study compares functional outcome and donor site morbidity of peroneus longus with hamstring tendon autograft to assess if it can be considered as one of the first choic-es for ACLR.Methods. This prospective cohort study involves 54 patients who underwent arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR. 27 patients each were operated on with hamstring and peroneus longus autografts. At 2 years follow-up, functional outcome was compared between groups using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm scores. Donor site morbidity in the peroneus longus group was assessed using Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores.Results. At 2 years follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean IKDC (77.26 vs 80.78), Modified Cincinnati (84.41 vs 89.07), and Tegner-Ly-sholm scores (85.19 vs 88.78) between the hamstring and peroneus groups respec-tively. Mean FADI and AOFAS scores at 2 years follow up were 96.11 and 91.67 respectively in the peroneus group suggesting no significant donor site morbidity as compared to preoperative scores.Conclusions. Peroneus longus performs similar to hamstring grafts and can be consid-ered as one of the first choices for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction.","[Agrawal, Shashwat; Hegde, Atmananda S.; Rao, B.

ACL injuries are common, often leading to knee instability and subsequent complications. ACL reconstruction is a standard treatment option, with various autograft sources available. The anterior half of the peroneus longus (AHPL) tendon has emerged as a potential alternative autograft. This study aimes to examine the anterior knee pain in ACL reconstruction using AHPL. Materials and Methods: This study included 51 patients with ACL injuries undergoing ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft. Patient demographics, surgical details, and Kujala scores were collected. Results: The average age of our participants was 25.88 +/- 5.39 years, with mean BMI classified as obese. Significant improvements in Kujala and KOOS pain scores were observed between each data collection. There was a negative correlation between baseline and three and six months post-operatively Kujala and KOOS pain scores with BMI. Discussion: The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft significantly reduced anterior knee pain, as indicated by a better Kujala and KOOS pain score. Previous studies have highlighted concerns regarding anterior knee pain with other autograft sources, such as the patellar and hamstring tendons. The AHPL tendon autograft offers a promising alternative with favorable anterior knee pain and minimal donor site morbidity. Conclusion: In ACL reconstruction, the AHPL tendon autograft demonstrates excellent outcomes regarding anterior knee pain, as measured by the Kujala score.","[Pontoh, Ludwig Andibert Powantia; Dilogo, Ismail Hadisoebroto; Kamal, Achmad Fauzi] Cipto Mangunkusumo Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Cent Jakarta 10430, Dki Jakarta, Indonesia; [Pontoh, Ludwig Andibert Powantia; Putra, Anggaditya] Fatmawati Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, South Jakarta 12430, Dki Jakarta, Indonesia; [Rhatomy, Sholahuddin] Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Cent Java 57424, Indonesia; [Fiolin, Jessica] Pondok Indah Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, South Jakarta 12310, Dki Jakarta, Indonesia; [Herdiman, Joshua Alward; Pontoh, Ega Wirayoda] Univ Indonesia, Fac Med, Cent Jakarta, Dki Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Pontoh, LAP (corresponding author), Cipto Mangunkusumo Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Cent Jakarta 10430, Dki Jakarta, Indonesia.;Pontoh, LAP (corresponding author), Fatmawati Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, South Jakarta 12430, Dki Jakarta, Indonesia.",lappontoh@gmail.com,"Dilogo, Ismail/ABA-3073-2020; rhatomy, sholahuddin/U-6158-2019; Kamal, Achmad Fauzi/L-7802-2017","pontoh, ludwig anibert powantia/0000-0001-8856-1977; rhatomy, sholahuddin/0000-0002-5512-6706; Kamal, Achmad Fauzi/0000-0002-9344-8212",,,,,41,1,1,2,2,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",,1179-1462,,ORTHOP RES REV,Orthop.

However, there are concerns regarding donor site morbidity. This study aims to compare the functional outcome of ACL reconstruction using hamstring (HT) and PLT autografts and evaluate the donor site morbidity. Methods Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (HT and PLT). Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Knee functional outcome was evaluated with IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores preoperatively, and postoperatively after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements, subjective evaluation of sensory disturbances, and ankle scoring with AOFAS and FADI scores. Results At 1-year follow-up, the PLT group showed comparable IKDC (p = 0.925) and Tegner-Lysholm (p = 0.600) scores with those of the HT group. The mean graft diameter in the PLT group (7.93 +/- 0.52 mm) was larger compared with the HT group (7.43 +/- 0.50 mm) (p < 0.001). The incidence of thigh atrophy (HT-16.7%, PLT-10%) and sensory disturbances (HT-73.3%, PLT-10%) was greater in the HT group. There was no significant ankle donor site morbidity in the PLT group (AOFAS-98.67 +/- 3.45, FADI-99.23 +/- 1.69). Conclusion ACL reconstruction with PLT had comparable functional outcome with that of HT at 1 year. However, PLT demonstrated larger graft diameter, less donor site morbidity, and enhanced muscle recovery without significantly affecting the ankle function.

However, harvesting HA could weaken the secondary stabilizer of the knee joint. Peroneus longus grafts (PL) is a novel option secondary to hamstring graft with less morbidity at the knee joint. We intended to determine whether peroneus longus autograft (PL) is a comparable alternative to hamstring autograft for ACL Reconstruction. Methods: 84 patients were grouped into hamstring (n = 51) and peroneus longus (n = 33) groups, with a mean age of 26.2 +/- 5.9 in the Hamstring group and a mean age of 26.4 +/- 6.6 in peroneus group. We obtain secondary data from the medical records of several hospitals in Makassar. Results: There was a significant difference in Lysholm score (p<0.05) in the hamstring group with peroneus at 6 months and 12 months postoperatively for IKDC score, anterior translation, Power Grading Flexi-Extension, ROM on flexion, and extension. In addition, in muscle atrophy, the Hamstring group compared to the peroneus group also showed a significant difference (p=0.001). Conclusion: The study's results did not show significant differences between the hamstring and peroneus groups other than atrophy of thigh muscles in the hamstring group. Based on the results of this study, we conclude peroneus longus graft is one of the graft options in ACL reconstruction surgery.","[Sakti, Muhammad; Arifin, Jainal; Wonggokusuma, Gerald; Arden, Ferdinand; Faidzin, Muhammad] Univ Hasanuddin, Orthopaed & Traumatol Dept, Makassar, Indonesia",Universitas Hasanuddin,"Faidzin, M (corresponding author), Univ Hasanuddin, Orthopaed & Traumatol Dept, Makassar, Indonesia.",muhffaidzinakbar@gmail.com,,"Arden, Ferdinand/0000-0002-1085-2974; Arifin, Jainal/0009-0004-3458-4574",,,,,15,1,3,0,0,UNIV UDAYANA,BALI,"KAMPUS UNUD SUDIRMAN, DENPASAR, BALI, 00000, INDONESIA",2089-1180,2302-2914,,BALI MED J,Bali Med.

This study introduced a minimally invasive, medial collateral ligament (MCL) augmentation technique using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft, which was fixed to the femoral deep MCL insertion and tibial superficial MCL insertion. Methods: This prospective, longitudinal, single-centre case series included patients who underwent MCL augmentation concurrent with primary or revision ACL reconstruction due to anteromedial instability. Preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up, clinical examinations, such as rolimeter test of anterior tibial translation and medial instability, knee (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], Lsyholm, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and foot function scores (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score [AOFAS]) and complications, were analyzed. Results: Thirty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 13.5 +/- 2.6 months and a mean age of 27.8 +/- 9.6 years were included. The side-to-side difference for anterior tibial translation significantly improved from preoperative to 1-year follow-up with an ACL reconstruction failure rate of 6.5%. No patient retained a grade 2 or 3 medial instability on valgus stress testing with 30 degrees flexion. Significant improvements from preoperative to 1-year postoperative follow-up were observed in knee function scores: IKDC (48.9 +/- 26.9- 71.3 +/- 11.5, p < 0.001) and Lysholm (59.9 +/- 28.5-80.5 +/- 11.2, p = 0.002) as well as KOOS pain, ADL, sport and QoL, each reaching the respective minimal clinically important difference values. The foot function score AOFAS showed no significant impairment (100 +/- 0-99.3 +/- 2.5, p = 0.250). Complications included cyclops lesions of ACL reconstruction in three patients. Conclusion: At 1-year follow-up, MCL augmentation using a peroneus longus split tendon autograft for patients simultaneously undergoing ACL reconstruction satisfactorily restores knee stability, has a low ACL reconstruction failure rate and does not significantly impair foot function.

The most used harvesting technique is performed with a single incision posterior to the lateral malleolus, with large series reporting tendon lengths enough to prepare a double or triple anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, resulting in mean diameters greater than 8.0 mm. However, as happens with the hamstrings, some patients may present PLT grafts with a 7-mm diameter, which is associated with higher failure rates and is the minimum acceptable diameter for ACL reconstructions. In turn, the 2-incision technique has longer graft lengths reported, enough to prepare 4-folded grafts, with mean diameters above 9.0 mm, ranging from 8.5 to 10 mm. Once the PLT graft diameter has a direct correlation with anthropometric measurements, as well as larger ACL graft diameters are associated with lower failure rates and revision surgeries, the inframalleolar harvesting seems to be a reasonable option, especially for short-stature patients with a greater risk of insufficient grafts. Additionally, patients who benefit from an extra-articular procedure can have a combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament using the PLT graft with the two-incision technique, with no need for another graft. Therefore, this article aims to describe the step-by-step technique for the inframalleolar PLT harvesting.","[da Silva, Andre Giardino Moreira; Choi, Gil Goulart; Giglio, Pedro Nogueira; Gobbi, Riccardo Gomes; Helito, Camilo Partezani] Univ Sao Paulo, Hosp Clin HCFMUSP, Fac Med, Grp Joelho,Inst Ortopedia & Traumatol, Rua Dr Ovidio Pires Campos,333 Cerqueira Cesar, BR-05403010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Macedo, Rodrigo Sousa; Godoy-Santos, Alexandre Leme] Univ Sao Paulo, Hosp Clin HCFMUSP, Grp Pee Tornozelo, Inst Ortopedia & Traumatol,Fac Med, Rua Dr Ovidio Pires Campos,333 Cerqueira Cesar, BR-05403010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Gobbi, Riccardo Gomes] HCor Hosp Coracao, Rua Desembargador Eliseu Guilherme,147 Paraiso, BR-04004030 Paraiso, SP, Brazil; [Godoy-Santos, Alexandre Leme] Hosp Israelita Albert Einstein, Ave Albert Einstein,627-701 Morumbi, BR-05652900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Helito, Camilo Partezani] Hosp Sirio Libanes, Rua Dona Adma Jafet,91 Bela Vista, BR-01308050 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Hospital do Coracao - HCor; Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein,"Helito, CP (corresponding author), Rua Dr Ovidio Pires Campos,333 Cerqueira Cesar, BR-05403010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",andre.giardino1@gmail.com; rodrigo_macedo@live.com; gilgchoi@gmail.com; pedrongiglio@gmail.com; gobbiortopedia@gmail.com; alexandrelemegodoy@gmail.com; camilo_helito@yahoo.com.br,"Gobbi, Riccardo/C-8131-2012; Giglio, Peo/A-7488-2017; Godoy-Santos, Alexane/F-7507-2016; Partezani Helito, Camilo/X-3880-2019","Gobbi, Riccardo/0000-0002-1715-4343; Giardino, Ane/0000-0002-2358-7508; Giglio, Peo/0000-0002-5855-0975; Godoy-Santos, Alexane/0000-0002-6672-1869;",,,,,11,0,1,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2059-7754,2059-7762,,J ISAKOS,J ISAKOS Joint Disord.

The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P < .001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. The peroneus longus tendon can be considered a safe, effective, and promising graft of choice for arthroscopic primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction because it has a good functional outcome and impressive donor ankle function after surgery.","[Hossain, G.

However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0 +/- 3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Tunnel positions, which were confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomical positions. At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4 +/- 7.1 vs. 89.3. = 8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71 +/- 0.57 vs. 1.85 +/- 0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15 = 0.36 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1 +/- 1.40 vs. 99.5 +/- 1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up.

Among the available methods to predict PLT measurements, anthropometric parameters are one of the most accessible and feasible methods. The objective of this prospective study was to predict the PLT autograft sizes in single bundle ACL reconstruction by using preoperative anthropometric measurement. Method: Anthropometric parameters, including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), true leg length (TLL), shank circumference and shank length of 20 patients with primary ACL reconstruction was measured before surgery. Univariate analysis, independent-sample t-test, Pearson correlation test, and logistic regression to evaluate the influence of these anthropometric variables on the diameter and length of the PLT autograft obtained. Result: Pearson correlation test has shown that body weight and height correlates to PLT length and diameter also autograft's length and diameter significantly (p < 0.05). The linear regression analysis showed that height, weight, TLL and shank length were signifcantly related to autograft diameter. While height and TLL were significantly related to autograft length. Conclusion: Height, weight, TLL and shank length can use to predict PLT autograft diameter. While height and TLL can use to predict PLT autograft length.","[Sakti, M.; Biakto, K. T.; Usman, M.

ACL tears are prevalent in high-school sports injuries, accounting for 50% of knee injuries in the U.S. Surgical reconstruction, often involving bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or hamstring autografts, is common, with varying success rates and complications. Emerging alternatives like the peroneus longus tendon show promise but require further comparative studies. This prospective and multicentric study included 110 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction from 2020 to 2022. Fifty-five patients received hamstring tendon autografts (Group H) and fifty-five received peroneus longus tendon autografts (Group P). Surgeries were performed by experienced surgeons using standardized techniques. Patients were evaluated using clinical tests and functional scores including the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire and IKDC-2000 at various postoperative intervals up to 24 months. Data were analyzed using SPSS with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Group H showed superior knee function preoperatively and at 24 months postoperatively compared to Group P. Group H had higher Lysholm and IKDC scores consistently throughout the study period. The anterior drawer and Lachman's tests indicated better knee stability for Group H. Complications were comparable between groups, with specific issues related to donor site morbidity and muscle weakness observed in each. The six-strand hamstring tendon autograft (Group H) demonstrated superior functional outcomes and knee stability compared to the peroneus longus tendon autograft (Group P) for ACL reconstruction. Despite some donor site morbidity, the hamstring tendon showed better long-term recovery and fewer complications. Future studies should explore larger, multicentric cohorts and integrate regenerative medicine techniques to further enhance ACL reconstruction outcomes.","[Vyacheslavovich, Ondar Artysh; Vladimirovna, Nikonova Alina; Bekzhan, Dzhunusov; Ivanovich, Khaizhok Konstantin] JSC Grp Hosp MEDSI, Moscow 123056, Russia; [Goncharov, Evgeniy; Koval, Oleg] Russian Res Ctr Surg, Fed State Budgetary Res Inst, Natl Clin Ctr 2, Moscow 121359, Russia; [Bezuglov, Eduard] Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Dept Sports Med & Med Rehabil, High Performance Sports Lab, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Ramirez, Manuel De Jesus Encarnacion] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Neurol Surg, Moscow 103274, Russia; [Montemurro, Nicola] Azienda Osped Univ Pisana AOUP, Dept Neurosurg, I-56100 Pisa, Italy",Petrovsky National Research Centre of Surgery; Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; University of Pisa; Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana,"Ramirez, MDE (corresponding author), Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Neurol Surg, Moscow 103274, Russia.;Montemurro, N (corresponding author), Azienda Osped Univ Pisana AOUP, Dept Neurosurg, I-56100 Pisa, Italy.",dr.encarnacionramirez@hotmail.com; nicola.montemurro@unipi.it,"Koval, Oleg/JCE-5828-2023; Montemurro, Nicola/AAQ-9107-2020","Encarnacion Ramirez, MANUEL DE JESUS/0000-0003-3541-0635;",,,,,65,2,2,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2673-4095,,SURGERIES-BASEL,Surgeries,SEP,2024,5,3,,,,,778,798,,10.3390/surgeries5030063,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/surgeries5030063,,,21,Surgery,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Surgery,H8V5C,,gold,,,2025-12-29,WOS:001326159600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Being a powerful evertor and flexor of great toe, there might be associated ankle morbidity with this autograft option. However, there are only a few studies exploring whether the ankle morbidity is significant or not. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes, donor site morbidity, and ankle strength after harvesting ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction in revision ACL and multi-ligament injury cases. Methods This was a prospective case series. All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. Results Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22-31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5-8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p = < 0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p = 0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.19), eversion strength(p = 0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p = 0.52), and AOFAS score(p = 0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients. Conclusions Peroneus longus autograft can be considered as a potential autograft option for ACL reconstruction in multi-ligament knee injuries and revision ACL reconstruction. No significant donor site morbidity was noted at follow-up.","[Goyal, Tarun; Paul, Souvik; Choudhury, Arghya Kundu; Sethy, Siddharth S.] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthoped, Bathinda 151001, Punjab, India",,"Goyal, T (corresponding author), All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthoped, Bathinda 151001, Punjab, India.",goyal.tarun@gmail.com; 1990.souvik@gmail.com; arghyakunduchoudhury@gmail.com; Sekhar.ciddharth@gmail.com,"paul, Souvik/AAX-6786-2020; Goyal, Tarun/AFV-9921-2022; Kundu Choudhury, Arghya/AAR-2757-2021","GOYAL, TARUN/0000-0002-1428-9947; Sethy, Siddharth Sekhar/0000-0002-4936-7896; Paul, Souvik/0000-0002-1172-3664; Kundu Choudhury, Arghya/0000-0002-8829-1206",,,,,32,20,29,0,5,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1633-8065,1432-1068,,EUR J ORTHOP SURG TR,Eur.

Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR) has been demonstrated to improve outcomes and stability of the knee compared with conservative management. Numerous techniques are available to the treating surgeon, such as the double-bundle PCLR technique, which has biomechanical superiority over single-bundle PCLR. Residual knee laxity is decreased, native knee kinematics are better replicated, and improved subjective and objective outcomes have been reported with anatomic double-bundle PCLR. The potential disadvantages of allografts and the use of multiple grafts have created the need for the use of a double-bundle PCLR with a single autograft. Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) grafts are frequently used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions, and good results have been reported with their use in single-bundle PCLR. The advantages of the PLT graft include a long length, large cross-sectional area, and a simple harvesting technique.

However, it remains unclear what happens when a larger-diameter graft is compressed to a smaller diameter, and how this alteration may affect the biomechanical properties of the graft. The objectives is determine whether the biomechanical strength of compressed allografts is preserved after reducing their diameter, and whether compression techniques could be considered a viable option for smaller patients such as women and children. Our hypothesis is that a compressed graft may retain similar strength to the original, despite having a reduced diameter. Methods: This was a cadaveric biomechanical case-control study using 30 peroneus longus (PL) tendon allografts. The grafts were divided into three groups: Group 0 (8 mm uncompressed grafts), Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts), and Group 2 (10 mm with a graft tube, compression to 9 mm). Each graft was tested using a Zwick/Roell Z005 tensile testing machine, undergoing cyclic loading between 50 and 250 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles, followed by continuous tensile loading to failure. The maximum failure force (Fmax) was recorded for each graft. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.18.5. Results: Group 1 (9 mm uncompressed grafts) showed a mean maximum failure force of 1902 N (SD: 432.12; 95 % CI). Group 2 (compressed grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1608 N (SD: 233.12; 95 % CI), with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.037). Group 0 (native 8 mm grafts) showed a mean Fmax of 1341 N (SD: 936.67; 95 % CI). No statistically significant difference was found between Group 0 and Group 2 (p = 0.196). Conclusions: The results indicate that the compressed group had lower resistance compared to the original 9 mm grafts. However, when compared to the smaller-diameter grafts, no significant difference in strength was observed. Nonetheless, the compressed grafts showed a tendency to withstand higher loads than the native 8 mm grafts.","[Rodriguez, Rafael Calvo; Duque, Waldo Gonzalez; Poblete, David Figueroa; Mena, Rafael Calvo] Univ St iago Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Duque, Waldo Gonzalez] Hosp Reg Coyha, Aysen, Chile; [Itriago, Minerva; Mena, Rafael Calvo] Hosp Sotero Del Rio, Santiago, Chile; [Villanueva, Jorge Isla] Hosp Salvador, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Duque, WG (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Clin Alemana, Santiago, Chile.",doctorwaldogonzalez@gmail.com,,"Gonzalez Duque, Waldo/0000-0001-7206-4482",,,,,26,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0972-978X,,,J ORTHOP,J.

The rupture of this ligament is quite frequent especially in athletic young subjects. Various methods have been used to reconstruct the ACL One of the new methods is to use a graft combined from peroneus loops and hamstring. As there is no evidence regarding this method, it was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this method. Method: Two groups of normal and those with ACL injury, in whom their ACLs were reconstructed with the new method, participated in this study. The kinematic and kinetic parameters during walking on level surface were evaluated by a motion analysis system (Qualysis) and a Kistler force plate. The difference between the parameters of operated and non-operated sides and also between patients and normal subjects was evaluated by use of a two sample t test (p-value was 0.05). Results: The results of this study showed that the pattern and magnitude of the loads transmitted by lower extrimity joints differed between normal and ACL reconstructed subjects. The sound side pattern and magnitude of motion were also influenced by ACL insufficiency. Conclusions: The results of the current study showed that the reconstructed ACL by use of this method did not have enough performance to restore the function of the leg. As the knee joint is unstable following the use of this method, it is recommended to find a new method of ACL reconstruction to improve the function of this ligament after reconstruction.

Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO2-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. Hypothesis: ACLR with SCCO2 allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO2-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL-Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. Results: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 +/- 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged <= 25 years (P = .007). Neither donor age (<= 40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P > .05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. Conclusion: SCCO2 processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft.","[Farey, John E.; Salmon, Lucy J.; Roe, Justin P.; Russell, Vivianne; Sundaraj, Keran; Pinczewski, Leo A.] North Sydney Orthopaed & Sports Med Ctr, Mater Clin, Suite 2,3 Gillies St, Wollstonecraft, NSW 2065, Australia; [Salmon, Lucy J.; Pinczewski, Leo A.] Univ Notre Dame Australia, Sch Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Roe, Justin P.] UNSW Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Sch Clin Med, Sydney, Australia",North Sydney Orthopaedic & Sports Medicine Centre; The University of Notre Dame Australia; University of Notre Dame Australia - Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Pinczewski, LA (corresponding author), North Sydney Orthopaed & Sports Med Ctr, Mater Clin, Suite 2,3 Gillies St, Wollstonecraft, NSW 2065, Australia.",lpinczewski@nsosmc.com.au,"; Salmon, Lucy/AAQ-7555-2020; Farey, John/AAV-3025-2020","PINCZEWSKI, Leo/0000-0002-2685-5109; Salmon, Lucy/0000-0002-0548-8573;",Friends of the Mater Foundation; Australian Biotechnologies,Friends of the Mater Foundation; Australian Biotechnologies,The authors acknowledge the assistance of Claire Monk in the recruitment and follow-up of patients.

There are different types of grafts used, and the choice depends on several factors. Autologous grafts, from the patients themselves, are the most common option, with rapid incorporation and a lower failure rate. Allografts from donors have their role in specific cases. Synthetic grafts, used in the 1980s, have advantages such as the absence of morbidity at the donor site, but studies have shown long-term complications. Hybrid grafts, combining autologous grafts and allografts, have gained interest, allowing a larger diameter and reducing morbidity. Peroneus longus tendon autograft has received attention, with positive results, good knee function and less hypotrophy of the thigh at the donor site. Autologous quadriceps tendon graft has gained popularity, with results comparable to patellar and flexor tendon grafts, lower morbidity at the donor site and a lower rate of re-rupture. The choice of graft has evolved, with autologous flexor grafts being preferred for less active patients and patellar grafts with bone fragments for high-performance athletes. Allografts, synthetic and hybrid grafts have their role in specific circumstances. The choice must be based on scientific evidence, considering advantages and disadvantages.

According to data in the general population, the incidence rate of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury was 1: 3500. The treatment option of ACL injury cases include physical exercise and reconstruction surgery. Graft options for the ACL reconstruction include: autograft and allograft. One of the most popular autograft is hamstring. The use of hamstrings in ACL reconstruction still arguing among the expert. The choice of autograft that can be chosen as a new alternative is the peroneus longus tendon. Currently, there is very few biomechanical study on peroneus longus strength as an alternative choice of autograft in ACL reconstruction. The study to determine the tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon was conducted by the researcher as a preliminary study that could bring new perspective for future studies. Materials and methods: This is an experimental research. Six human cadaveric specimens as research material. Each cadaver was treated by taking hamstring and peroneus from both lower limbs. The hamstring and peroneal tendons were then measured by applying the Hydraulic Servo Pulser tensile test apparatus. Data on tensile strength comparison between peroneal tendon and hamstring were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. Result: From the measurement results, it is known that hamstring has lower average tensile strength value compared to peroneus without significant difference (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The tensile strength of the peroneus longus tendon, which is similar to that of hamstring, gives information that both have the same biomechanic properties.

Methods All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6 weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years' follow-up. Results A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48 +/- 9.9 years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2%) or chondral (40.7%) injuries. At the 2 years' follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p = 0.0001) IKDC score (p = 0.0001), Lysholm score (p = 0.0001), and range of motion (p = 0.001). None of the patients had residual laxity on clinical examination of the knee joint at the 2 years' follow-up. All but two of the patients went back to their previous activity level. These two patients had progressive knee arthritis and needed knee arthroplasty. Conclusion Single-stage surgical reconstruction for chronic MKI has favourable functional outcomes.","[Goyal, Tarun] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthopaed, Bathinda 151001, Punjab, India; [Paul, Souvik; Banerjee, Sushovan; Das, Lakshmana] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthopaed, Rishikesh, India",All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh,"Goyal, T (corresponding author), All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Orthopaed, Bathinda 151001, Punjab, India.",goyal.tarun@gmail.com,"; paul, Souvik/AAX-6786-2020; Goyal, Tarun/AFV-9921-2022; , LAKSHMANA DAS/AAH-7972-2021","GOYAL, TARUN/0000-0002-1428-9947; , LAKSHMANA DAS/0000-0002-2720-6389; Paul, Souvik/0000-0002-1172-3664",,,,,52,13,16,0,3,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2234-2451,,KNEE SURG RELAT RES,Knee Surg.

Within the ACLI group, delayed MAOT of tibialis anterior with eyes open and gastrocnemius with eyes closed were found in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg. All other muscles were not significantly different between legs. In conclusion, the ACLI group showed delayed MAOT not only around the knee, but also at the hip and ankle muscles compared to the non-injured control group. No differences between both legs of the ACLI group were found, except for tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius.

Reconstructions are often performed using allografts rather than autografts on a case-by-case basis. Controversy exists as to whether or not age of donor tissue plays a factor in the mechanical properties of allografts. Methods: 38 peroneus longus (PL) tendons were prepared using the two-strand graft technique and then subjected to a cyclic loading test regimen of 1000 cycles to determine material properties. Specimens were grouped based on age to ascertain whether donor age affects the material properties of PL tendons. Findings: Secant modulus of the first cycle was determined to be 150.43 (SD 40.24) MPa. The average magnitude of the dynamic modulus was determined to be 82.81 (SD 24.65) MPa. Specimens were grouped into three distinct groups for analysis (x < 40 yo, 40 yo x <= 60 yo, 60 yo < x). Interpretation: The need for using intrinsic material properties is highlighted. There is no significant difference in any intrinsic material property with respect to age or the fatigue of the tendon as the cycle count increases. Conversely, the measured stiffness of a tendon decreased as function of age with a large effect size. Based on analysis of graft geometries, it was determined that PL tendons become significantly more slender with increased age which result in the observed decrease in stiffness.","[Wong, Andrew K.; Schaffler, Benjamin C.; Carrero, Leanza C.; Neufeld, Eric V.; Grande, Daniel A.] Feinstein Inst Med Res, Orthopaed Res Lab, Manhasset, NY USA; [Calvo M, Rafael; Calvo R, Rafael] Univ Desarrollo, Clin Alemana Santiago, Vitacura, Region Metropol, Chile; [Nixon, Ryan A.] Northwell Hlth, Dept Orthoped Surg, New Hyde Pk, NY USA; [Schaffler, Benjamin C.; Neufeld, Eric V.] Donald & Barbara Zucker Sch Med Hofstra Northwell, Hempstead, NY USA",Northwell Health; Clinica Alemana; Universidad del Desarrollo; Northwell Health; Northwell Health,"Grande, DA (corresponding author), 350 Community Dr, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA.",dgrande@northwell.edu,,,,,,,34,6,9,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-0033,1879-1271,,CLIN BIOMECH,Clin.

Before surgery, temporary storage and, in most cases, sterilization are essential. It is, thus, crucial to determine how these procedures alter the grafts' biomechanical properties. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of different sterilization methods (native, frozen, frozen + 21 kGy gamma irradiation, frozen + 21 kGy electron beam irradiation) and storage durations (0 to 4 months) on the deformation and creep of two tendon types (tibialis anterior, peroneus longus). 80 tibialis anterior and 83 peroneus longus tendons from 51 human cadavers were included. The samples were removed, placed in a radio-cryoprotectant solution, then slowly cooled, sterilized and stored at -80 degrees C. All groups were subject to 60 s static creep test with 250 N load. Deformation during the loading phase, creep during static loading, and the ratio of these two were evaluated. Deformation at the end of the loading phase and creep consistently exhibited significantly smaller values in the tibialis anterior compared to the peroneus longus type, as well as in electron beam-sterilized grafts as opposed to gamma beam-sterilized ones. Prolonged storage periods (within 0 to 4 months) resulted in a notable increase in these values, particularly in deformation. Based on the experimental data, the tibialis anterior tendon type and sterilization by gamma beam irradiation are better choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than the peroneus longus and sterilization by electron beam. Increased storage time affects negatively the evaluated mechanical properties.","[Gokler, Daniella Judit; Farago, Denes; Kiss, Rita Maria] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mechatron Opt & Mech Engn Informat, Budapest, Hungary; [Karacsony, Atilla Ferenc; Pap, Karoly] Semmelweis Univ Budapest, Dept Traumatol, Budapest, Hungary; [Karacsony, Atilla Ferenc] Buda Hosp Hosp Order St John God, Dept Orthoped, Budapest, Hungary; [Szebenyi, Gabor] MTA BME Lendulet Lightweight Polymer Composites R, Budapest, Hungary; [Szebenyi, Gabor] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Polymer Engn, Budapest, Hungary; [Pap, Karoly] Uzsok Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Budapest, Hungary; [Szebenyi, Gabor] Muegyetem Rkp 3 T203, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Semmelweis University; Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Szeb‚nyi, G (corresponding author), Muegyetem Rkp 3 T203, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.",,"; Kiss, Rita/G-4315-2015","Kar csony, Atilla/0000-0001-8236-4569;","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) [K 138472, TKP2021-EGA-02]; Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund [TKP2021]; Hungarian Academy of Sciences [UNKP-23-5-BME-415]; Ministry for Innovation and Technology","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH)(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund; Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); Ministry for Innovation and Technology","This work was supported by the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) through grant K 138472.

The risk of infections necessitates thorough sterilization procedures, and the allografts usually need to be stored prior to surgery. Classical mechanical tests have been performed with various types of tendons, however, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus tend to suffer the least biomechanical changes after irradiation. Only few results are available of the strain and creep behaviour of tendons, even though this information is necessary to provide suitable allografts. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of different tendon types (T-tibialis anterior, P-peroneus longus), sterilization methods (G-gamma irradiation of 21 kGy, E-electron beam irradiation of 21 kGy) and storage times (5 and 6 months) on the creep behavior, which is characterized by the strain at the end of the loading phase and creep deformation after static loading. Static creep tests were performed with 250 N load during 60 s. Deformation at the end of the loading phase of both tendons was significantly smaller after 5 months long storage than that after 6 months long storage. TE5 showed significantly less creep than group TE6, and TE6 significantly greater than PE6. The creep of TE5 was significantly lower than that of TG5. Based on the data, the peroneus longus sterilized by electron beam and stored deep frozen for 5 months is a better choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than tibialis anterior sterilized by gamma irradiation stored for 6 months.","[Gokler, Daniella Judit; Farago, Denes; Kiss, Rita Maria] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mech Opt & Mech Engn Informat, Budapest, Hungary; [Farago, Denes; Szebenyi, Gabor; Kiss, Rita Maria] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Biomech Res Ctr, Budapest, Hungary; [Pap, Karoly] Semmelweis Univ Budapest, Dept Traumatol, Budapest, Hungary; [Szebenyi, Gabor] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Polymer Engn, Budapest, Hungary; [Pap, Karoly] Uzsoki Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Semmelweis University; Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Kiss, RM (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mech Opt & Mech Engn Informat, Budapest, Hungary.;Kiss, RM (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Biomech Res Ctr, Budapest, Hungary.",rita.kiss@mogi.bme.hu,"Kiss, Rita/G-4315-2015",,"Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) [OTKA K116189]; NRDI Fund TKP2020 NC under the Ministry for Innovation and Technology, Hungary [BME-NC]","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH)(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); NRDI Fund TKP2020 NC under the Ministry for Innovation and Technology, Hungary","This work was supported by Hungarian National Research, Devel-opment and Innovation Office (NKFIH) through grant OTKA K116189 (Research project entitled In vitro investigation of human tissues and definition of their mechanical materials models) .

Revision ACLr is often indicated to restore knee stability, improve knee function, and facilitate return to cutting and pivoting activities. Prior to reconstruction, a thorough clinical and diagnostic evaluation is required to identify factors that may have predisposed an individual to recurrent ACL injury, appreciate concurrent intra-articular pathology, and select the optimal graft for revision reconstruction. Single-stage revision can be successful, although a staged approach may be used when optimal tunnel placement is not possible due to the position and/or widening of previous tunnels. Revision ACLr often involves concomitant procedures such as meniscal/chondral treatment, lateral extra-articular augmentation, and/or osteotomy.

Despite ACL reconstruction (ACLR), residual instability is common, affecting knee function. Anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) alongside ACLR improves outcomes, as the ALL plays a significant role in rotational stability. This study aims to assess the clinical and functional outcomes of the ACLR+ALLR combination using biomechanical testing in patients with at least ten months of follow-up. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional comparative cohort study involves patients with ACLR. Inclusion criteria were adult patients who underwent ACLR within the last 3 years, with the same surgical technique performed by a single operator. Patients underwent anamnestic and clinical evaluation and completed Lysholm and KOOS questionnaires. Biomechanical tests included a Unilateral Drop Jump, a Countermovement Jump with knee rotation, and a five-repetition Sit-To-Stand. Force platforms, a camera, and surface electromyography were used to assess biomechanical stability and joint function. Results: This study included 18 subjects, 5 with ACLR and ALLR, and 13 with ACLR alone. The groups showed no significant differences in the KOOS and Lysholm scales and clinical outcomes. Muscle trophism reduction compared to the contralateral limb was noted in both groups. Biomechanical evaluations showed no difference in Quadriceps muscle activity during the landing phase of the Drop Jump. However, the ACL-ALL group exhibited fewer spikes and fewer knee joint angular excursions during ground impact stabilization. In the 5-STS task, a significant difference was observed in the vertical force peak. Differences in muscle activity during foot rotation and force components during the jumping phase were noted in the Countermovement Jump. Conclusions: ACLR combined with ALLR shows similar perceived joint function but improved biomechanical joint stability. Further studies with larger samples and longer follow-ups are needed for validation.","[Cassano, Giuseppe Danilo; Moretti, Lorenzo; Bortone, Ilaria; Favilla, Ennio; Solarino, Giuseppe] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Sch Med, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sense Organs, AOU Consorziale Policlin,Orthopaed & Trauma Unit, Piazza Giulio Cesare 11, I-70124 Bari, Italy; [Coviello, Michele] Univ Foggia, Fac Med & Surg, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Policlin Riuniti Foggia,Orthopaed Unit, I-71122 Foggia, Italy; [Musci, Mariapia] Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management DMMM, I-70126 Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Foggia; Politecnico di Bari,"Cassano, GD (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Sch Med, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sense Organs, AOU Consorziale Policlin,Orthopaed & Trauma Unit, Piazza Giulio Cesare 11, I-70124 Bari, Italy.",dancassanox@gmail.com; lorenzomoretti1@gmail.com; michelecoviello91@gmail.com; ilariabortone@gmail.com; pia19091997@gmail.com; enniofavilla@gmail.com; giuseppe.solarino@uniba.it,"Bortone, Ilaria/O-3143-2019; Coviello, Michele/GLS-0176-2022; Solarino, Giuseppe/GNM-6038-2022; Cassano, Giuseppe danilo/IAR-2709-2023","Bortone, Ilaria/0000-0002-4767-5334; Coviello, Michele/0000-0003-3585-1000; Cassano, Giuseppe danilo/0000-0001-9212-1253",,,,,35,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1010-660X,1648-9144,,MEDICINA-LITHUANIA,Med.

Although physical testing is commonly used after ACLR to assess injury risk to the operated knee, strength, jump, and change-of-direction performance and biomechanical measures have not been examined in those who go on to experience a contralateral ACL injury, to identify factors that may be associated with injury risk. Purpose: To prospectively examine differences in biomechanical and clinical performance measures in male athletes 9 months after ACLR between those who ruptured their previously uninjured contralateral ACL and those who did not at 2-year follow-up and to examine the ability of these differences to predict contralateral ACL injury. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A cohort of male athletes returning to level 1 sports after ACLR (N = 1045) underwent isokinetic strength testing and 3-dimensional biomechanical analysis of jump and change-of-direction tests 9 months after surgery. Participants were followed up at 2 years regarding return to play or at second ACL injury. Between-group differences were analyzed in patient-reported outcomes, performance measures, and 3-dimensional biomechanics for the contralateral limb and asymmetry. Logistic regression was applied to determine the ability of identified differences to predict contralateral ACL injury. Results: Of the cohort, 993 had follow-up at 2 years (95%), with 67 experiencing a contralateral ACL injury and 38 an ipsilateral injury. Male athletes who had a contralateral ACL injury had lower quadriceps strength and biomechanical differences on the contralateral limb during double- and single-leg drop jump tests as compared with those who did not experience an injury. Differences were related primarily to deficits in sagittal plane mechanics and plyometric ability on the contralateral side. These variables could explain group membership with fair to good ability (area under the curve, 0.74-0.80). Patient-reported outcomes, limb symmetry of clinical performance measures, and biomechanical measures in change-of-direction tasks did not differentiate those at risk for contralateral injury. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of sagittal plane control during drop jump tasks and the limited utility of limb symmetry in performance and biomechanical measures when assessing future contralateral ACL injury risk in male athletes. Targeting the identified differences in quadriceps strength and plyometric ability during late-stage rehabilitation and testing may reduce ACL injury risk in healthy limbs in male athletes playing level 1 sports.

The addition of LET or anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction is typically recommended at the time of index ACL reconstruction surgery and is performed after the ACL graft is tensioned. Rotational instability has been described in cases where the ACL graft was malpositioned too vertically, and in those cases, ACL revision is indicated. In our case, ACL reconstruction was performed in isolation in a hyperflexible, high-risk (volleyball) female athlete, and she had persistent complaints of rotational instability despite an intact and well-positioned ACL graft on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. She demonstrated excessive internal rotation of the tibia in relation to the femur and exhibited symptomatic anterolateral instability on clinical examination, with a negative pivot shift but pain on internal rotation stress. She underwent a second surgery consisting of isolated modified Lemaire LET after examination under anesthesia (EUA) demonstrated negative Lachman and pivot shift. Second-look arthroscopy demonstrated an intact quadriceps autograft ACL graft. She recovered uneventfully, and her rotational instability problem was resolved. She returned to sports 12 months after the surgery and has been pleased with her result. Key Concepts: (1) Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) can be added to increased rotational stability in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. (2) Although typically added during the index procedure, it can be successfully completed later if needed. (3) The ACL confers both anteroposterior and rotational stability to prevent excessive anterior translation and excessive internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur. (4) LET can augment the ACL graft in preventing rotational instability in the setting of an ACL-deficient knee.","[Randall, Rachel M.] Marshfield Clin Hlth Syst, Marshfield, WI 54449 USA",,"Randall, RM (corresponding author), Marshfield Clin Hlth Syst, Marshfield, WI 54449 USA.",randall.rachel@marshfieldclinic.org,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2768-2765,,J PEDIATR ORTHOP SOC,J.

There is limited evidence on the effect of lateral extra-articular procedures in revision ACL surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients with lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) in combination with revision ACLR for combined ACL graft failure and high-grade anterior knee instability. Methods: Between 2016 and 2018, 75 patients with graft failure after primary ACLR and high-grade anterior knee instability who received revision ACLR were included in the retrospective study. High-grade anterior knee instability was defined as high-grade pivot-shift or side-to-sick difference of more than six millimeters in Rolimeter (R)-testing. An additional modified Lemaire tenodesis was performed in 59 patients during revision ACLR. Seventy-three patients were clinically examined with a minimum of two years after revision surgery. Results: Failure of the revision ACLR occurred in 8.2% (n = 6) of the cases. LET lead to significant decreased failure rates (five percent vs. 21%, p .045) and decreased incidence of a positive pivot-shift in patients with revision ACLR and high-grade anterior knee instability in comparison to patients without LET. Also, postoperative functional scores were significantly increased in the group of additional LET. Conclusions: Additional LET in patients with revision ACLR and high-grade anterior instability significantly reduces the risk of failure of revision ACLR, the incidence of pivot-shift and increases postoperative functional outcome.

The objective of this study was to improve knowledge regarding the treatment of ACL-deficient knees with combined ACL and ALL reconstruction. Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction has been hypothesized to result in better clinical and functional outcomes than isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Methods One-hundred and seven adult male athletes with ACL tears and high-grade pivot shifts were randomized into two groups. Those in group A (n = 54) underwent ACLR, while those in group B (n = 53) underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction. The median age was 26 (18-40) and 24 (18-33) years in groups A and B, respectively, and the median follow-up was 60 (55-65) months. Physical examination findings, instrumented knee laxity tested using a KT-1000 arthrometer, and International Knee Documentation Committee Scale (IKDC) scores were used to evaluate the outcomes. Results One-hundred and two patients were available for follow-up: 52 in group A and 50 in group B. Postoperatively, the pivot shift was normal in 43 (82.7%) and 48 (96%) patients in groups A and B, respectively (p < 0.001). The median instrumented knee laxity was 2.5 +/- 0.7 (1.2-6.1) mm in patients in group A and 1.2 +/- 0.7 (1.2-3.2) mm in patients in group B (p < 0.001). Additionally, 44 (84.6%) patients in group A had normal IKDC scores and 3 (5.8%) had nearly normal scores, while 48 (96.0%) patients in group B had normal IKDC scores and 2 (4%) had nearly normal scores (p < 0.001). Conclusion Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction, compared with isolated ACLR resulted in favourable clinical and functional outcomes, as demonstrated by decreased rotational instability and instrumented knee laxity, a lower graft rupture rate and better postoperative IKDC scores.","[Hamido, Fawzy; Habiba, Abdelrahman A.; Marwan, Yousef; Shoaeb, Wael; Nagi, Ahmed] Minist Hlth, Div Sports Med, Al Razi Orthopaed Hosp, Kuwait, Kuwait; [Marwan, Yousef] Kuwait Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Fac Med, Div Orthopaed Surg,Dept Surg, Kuwait, Kuwait; [Soliman, Aymen S.

However, a good functional outcome even after a successful surgery depends on multiple factors. It has been observed that certain patients with a chronic ACL injury demonstrate knee instability voluntarily. The authors observed that these patients might not perform well even after a successful surgery. This study aims to assess the outcome after ACL and other ligament reconstruction in patients with voluntary knee instability. Methods: From a total of 824 patients who underwent ACLR, 13 patients with a history of voluntary knee instability were selected, and data of these patients (demographic and clinical profile) were obtained. Outcomes of surgery in this group of patients were evaluated by using Lysholm score and Tegner activity level. Results: All patients were young men with a chronic ACL injury and manifested instability. Associated injuries were lateral meniscus tear in 3 patients, medial meniscus tear in 2, and posterolateral corner (PLC) injury in 3. ACLR was done using the semitendinosus-gracilis graft in all patients. Further, anterolateral ligament reconstruction was done in 2 patients and PLC reconstruction, in 3 patients. The mean Lysholm score was 54.76 (range, 48-62) preoperatively and 60.92 (range, 54-78) at a mean follow-up of 14.3 months (range, 11-26 months). The median Tegner activity level was 6 (range, 5-7) before injury and 4 (range, 3-5) at the final follow-up. Twelve of the 13 patients were able to demonstrate instability voluntarily at the time of the final follow-up. Conclusions: In patients with ACL and other ligament injuries who demonstrated voluntary knee instability, the functional out-come even after successful ligament reconstruction was poor.","[Sood, Munish; Kulshrestha, Vikas] Command Hosp WC Chandimandir, Dept Orthopaed, Panchkula 134107, India; [Sachdeva, Julie] Command Hosp WC Chandimandir, Dept Med, Panchkula, India; [Ghai, Amresh] Base Hosp Delhi Cantt, Dept Orthopaed, New Delhi, India; [Sud, Ajaydeep] Armed Forces Med Coll, Dept Orthopaed, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Singh, Shalender] Armed Forces Med Coll, Dept Neuroanaesthesia & Crit Care, Pune, Maharashtra, India",Armed Forces Medical College; Armed Forces Medical College,"Sood, M (corresponding author), Command Hosp WC Chandimandir, Dept Orthopaed, Panchkula 134107, India.",soodmunishafmc@gmail.com,"kulshrestha, vikas/MBG-5006-2025; Sood, Munish/KII-0265-2024","Kulshrestha, Vikas/0000-0002-6996-9464",,,,,25,19,20,0,2,KOREAN ORTHOPAEDIC ASSOC,SEOUL,"#1111 LIFECOMBI BLDG, YOEIDO-DONG, YOUNGDEUNGPO-GU, SEOUL, 150-732, SOUTH KOREA",2005-291X,2005-4408,,CLIN ORTHOP SURG,Clin.

Methods On a knee joint test bench, six fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens were tested at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees of knee flexion in the following states: 1) intact; 2) with resected ACL; 3) with resected ACL combined with anterolateral rotatory instability; 4) with an isolated ACLR; and 5) with combined ACLR + LET. The specimens were examined under various external loads: 1) unloaded; 2) with an anterior tibial translation force (ATF) of 98 N; 3) with an internal tibial torque (IT) of 5 Nm; and 4) with a combined internal tibial torque of 5 Nm and an anterior tibial translation force of 98 N (IT + ATF). The graft forces of the ACLR and LET were recorded by load cells incorporated into custom devices, which were screwed into the femoral tunnels. Motion of the knee joint was analysed using a 3D camera system. Results During IT and IT + ATF, the addition of a LET reduced the ACLR graft forces up to 61% between 0 degrees and 60 degrees of flexion (P = 0.028). During IT + ATF, the LET graft forces reached 112 N. ACLR alone did not restore native internal tibial rotation after combined ACL deficiency and anterolateral rotatory instability. Combined ACLR + LET was able to restore native internal tibial rotation values for 0 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion with decreased internal tibial rotation at 30 degrees of flexion. Conclusion The study demonstrates that the addition of a LET decreases the forces seen by the ACLR graft and reduces residual rotational laxity after isolated ACLR during internal tibial torque loading. Due to load sharing, a LET could support the ACLR graft and perhaps be the reason for reduced repeat rupture rates seen in clinical studies. Care must be taken not to limit the internal tibial rotation when performing a LET.","[Mayr, Raul; Sigloch, Maximilian; Coppola, Christian; Iltchev, Alessandra; Schmoelz, Werner] Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Anichstr 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Hoermann, Romed] Med Univ Innsbruck, Inst Clin & Funct Anat, Innsbruck, Austria",Medical University of Innsbruck; Medical University of Innsbruck,"Schmoelz, W (corresponding author), Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Anichstr 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",werner.schmoelz@i-med.ac.at,"Schmoelz, Werner/M-6572-2017","Schmoelz, Werner/0000-0003-2962-2594",Society for Orthopaedic Traumatologic Sports Medicine (GOTS),Society for Orthopaedic Traumatologic Sports Medicine (GOTS),This study was supported by a research grant of the Society for Orthopaedic Traumatologic Sports Medicine (GOTS) received by RM.,,44,15,19,0,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2197-1153,,J EXP ORTHOP,J Exp.

However, residual rotational instability of the knee joint remains a major concern. The anterolateral ligament (ALL) has recently gained interest as a secondary stabilizer of knee joint rotatory instability, and this has led to the attempt of ALL reconstruction (ALLR) in combination with ACLR to restore rotational stability in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Although several techniques for ALLR have recently been introduced, the ideal graft type and surgical technique for combined ACLR and ALLR are yet to be established. This technical note therefore aimed at introducing a novel surgical procedure involving the use of a single Achilles tendon allograft as a relatively simple and minimally invasive procedure for combined ALL and ACL reconstruction.","[Lee, Chul-Soo; Han, Seung-Beom; Jang, Ki-Mo] Korea Univ, Anam Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Coll Med, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine),"Jang, KM (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Anam Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Coll Med, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",anotherlife@naver.com; sbhan1107@gmail.com; kimo98@hanmail.net,"; Jang, Ki-Mo/ABH-4006-2020","Chul Soo, Lee/0000-0001-5254-5692; Jang, Ki-Mo/0000-0001-9370-3319","Technology Innovation Program (or Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program) [20003688]; Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea)","Technology Innovation Program (or Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program); Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea)(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by the Technology Innovation Program (or Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program) (No. 20003688, Development of cosmeceutical and medical device platform using biodegradable metal patch delivering microcurrent) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea).",,31,2,2,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1010-660X,1648-9144,,MEDICINA-LITHUANIA,Med.

However, the effect of anatomic ALL reconstruction (ALLR) in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) has not been biomechanically investigated or validated. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to investigate the biomechanical function of anatomic ALLR in the setting of a combined ACL and ALL injury. More specifically, this investigation focused on the effect of ALLR on resultant rotatory stability when performed in combination with concomitant ACLR. It was hypothesized that ALLR would significantly reduce internal rotation and axial plane translation laxity during a simulated pivot-shift test compared with isolated ACLR. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were evaluated with a 6 degrees of freedom robotic system. Knee kinematics were evaluated with simulated clinical examinations including a simulated pivot-shift test consisting of coupled 10-Nm valgus and 5-Nm internal rotation torques, a 5-Nm internal rotation torque, and an 88-N anterior tibial load. Kinematic differences between ACLR with an intact ALL, ACLR with ALLR, and ACLR with a deficient ALL were compared with the intact state. Single-bundle ACLR tunnels and ALLR tunnels were placed anatomically according to previous quantitative anatomic attachment descriptions. Results: Combined anatomic ALLR and ACLR significantly improved the rotatory stability of the knee compared with isolated ACLR in the face of a concurrent ALL deficiency. During a simulated pivot-shift test, ALLR significantly reduced internal rotation and axial plane tibial translation when compared with ACLR with an ALL deficiency. Isolated ACLR for the treatment of a combined ACL and ALL injury was not able to restore stability of the knee, resulting in a significant increase in residual internal rotation laxity. ALLR did not affect anterior tibial translation; no significant differences were observed between the varying ALL conditions with ACLR except between ACLR with an intact ALL and ACLR with a deficient ALL at 0 degrees of flexion. Conclusion: In the face of a combined ACL and ALL deficiency, concurrent ACLR and ALLR significantly improved the rotatory stability of the knee compared with solely reconstructing the ACL.","[Nitri, Marco; Rasmussen, Matthew T.; Williams, Brady T.; Moulton, Samuel G.; Cruz, Raphael Serra; Dornan, Grant J.; Goldsmith, Mary T.; LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Vail, CO USA; [Nitri, Marco; Rasmussen, Matthew T.; Williams, Brady T.; Moulton, Samuel G.; Cruz, Raphael Serra; Dornan, Grant J.; Goldsmith, Mary T.; LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, 181 West Meadow Dr,Suite 1000, Vail, CO 81657 USA; [LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Clin, Vail, CO USA",Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Steadman Philippon Research Institute,"LaPrade, RF (corresponding author), Steadman Philippon Res Inst, 181 West Meadow Dr,Suite 1000, Vail, CO 81657 USA.",drlaprade@sprivail.org,"Dornan, Grant/ABC-7409-2020; LaPrade, Robert/AFA-8673-2022","Dornan, Grant/0000-0001-9039-9163; LaPrade, Robert/0000-0002-9823-2306",Arthrex Inc.; Ossur Americas; Smith Nephew; Linvatec,Arthrex Inc.; Ossur Americas; Smith Nephew; Linvatec,"One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: The authors acknowledge Arthrex Inc for in-kind donations of surgical supplies and AlloSource for the donation of graft tissues.

Methods: Two groups of patients were evaluated and compared retrospectively. Both groups consisted of patients with ACL injuries and associated ligamentous hyperlaxity, defined based on the modified Beighton scale with a minimum score of 5. Group 1 patients underwent anatomical ACL reconstruction, and group 2 patients underwent anatomical ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction. Group 1 consisted of historical controls. The presence of associated meniscal injury, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm functional scores, KT-1000 measurements, the presence of a residual pivot-shift, and the graft rupture rate were evaluated. The study was performed at University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. Results: Ninety patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with ligamentous hyperlaxity were evaluated. The mean follow up was 29.6 +/- 6.2 months for group 1 and 28.1 +/- 4.2 months for group 2 (P = .51). No significant differences were found between the groups regarding Beighton scale, gender, the duration of injury before reconstruction, follow-up time, preoperative instability, or associated meniscal injuries. The mean age was 29.9 +/- 8.1 years in group 1 and 27.0 +/- 9.1 years in group 2 (P = .017). In the final evaluation, group 2 patients showed better anteroposterior clinical stability as evaluated by KT-1000 arthrometry (P = .02), better rotational stability as evaluated by the pivot-shift test (P = .03) and a lower reconstruction failure rate (21.7% [group 1] vs 3.3% [group 2]; P = .03). Clinical evaluations of postoperative functional scales showed no differences between the 2 groups (P = .27 for International Knee Documentation Committee; P = .41 for Lysholm).

Available studies have focussed on tunnel positioning and hence attachment site of the ligament. Few studies which have focussed on morphology reflect ambiguities in size, fibre bundle, number and disposition. Since a near anatomical repair of the ACL is the treatment of choice, the present study was planned to describe the morphology of ACL. Twenty-two ACL (11 right and 11 left) isolated from knee joints of collection of adult embalmed lower limbs were utilised for the study. The ACL morphology and morphometry were studied for footprints and fibre bundles. Three distinct bundles of differing lengths constitute a spiral ACL complex. These bundles are positioned asintermediate with posteromedial and anterolateral flanking in respective positions. The tibial and femoral footprints are paw-shaped and oval respectively.

ACL injury leads to increased knee laxity and abnormal knee biomechanics that may prevent return to sports and predispose to early onset degenerative changes in the joint. Therefore, optimizing ACL injury treatment is of great interest to the sports medicine field. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is considered the treatment of choice for most patients, especially in those involved in cutting and pivoting activities, often allowing them to return sports. ACLR has been based traditionally on standardized techniques that neglected the individual anatomy of the patient. Individualized anatomical ACLR is considered a new concept that is based on tailoring the ACL surgery to the individual patient. It uses preoperative measurements on plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging as well as intraoperative measurement of the patients' native ACL and knee anatomy to precisely determine the variations in the size of femoral and tibial insertion site and size and morphology of the intercondylar notch. The ultimate goal of individualized anatomical ACL reconstruction is to restore the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion site to replicate the individual anatomy as closely as possible. In this concept, the choice to perform a single- or double-bundle reconstruction or augmentation depends on aforementioned variations in the anatomy of the ACL and the knee joint.

ACL stump (ACLS)-retaining ACL reconstruction and non-ACLS-retaining ACL reconstruction are the two surgical options. Aim: To investigate the efficacy of retaining the ACLS in allograft reconstruction. Material and methods: Thirty patients were retrospectively assigned to group A, ACLS-retaining ACL reconstruction; and group B, non-ACLS-retaining ACL reconstruction, and their data were analyzed. The knee function (Lysholm score and Tegner motion score) and proprioceptive function of the two groups were assessed and compared by postoperative reconstruction angle. Results: The 30 patients were followed up for a mean 20 months. The mean Lysholm score in group A increased from 55.7 +/- 11.6 points preoperatively to 95.2 +/- 5.7 points postoperatively; that in group B increased from 56.7 +/- 11.3 points preoperatively to 94.6 +/- 7.2 points postoperatively. The mean Tegner motion score in group A was increased from 2.4 +/- 0.7 points preoperatively to 6.0 +/- 0.7 points postoperatively; that in group B increased from 2.73 +/- 0.96 points preoperatively to 6.24 +/- 0.48 points postoperatively; the postoperative scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. The proprioception was better in group A than in group B at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively (p < 0.05). Conclusions: ACLS-retaining ACL reconstruction has good efficacy and the retained ACLS can benefit postoperative proprioception recovery at an early stage.","[Chen, Tie-Zhu; Li, Xiao-Sheng] Hunan Prov Peoples Hosp, Dept Orthoped, 61 Jiefang West Rd, Changsha 410000, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tie-Zhu; Wang, Yi-Sheng] Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Orthoped, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University,"Li, XS (corresponding author), Hunan Prov Peoples Hosp, Dept Orthoped, 61 Jiefang West Rd, Changsha 410000, Hunan, Peoples R China.",xiaoshenglidoc@126.com,,,,,,,20,12,14,0,7,TERMEDIA PUBLISHING HOUSE LTD,POZNAN,"KLEEBERGA ST 2, POZNAN, 61-615, POLAND",1895-4588,2299-0054,,VIDEOSURGERY MINIINV,Videosurgery Miniinvasive Tec.,,2019,14,3,,,,,461,467,,10.5114/wiitm.2019.81305,http://dx.doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2019.81305,,,7,Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Surgery,IU1BP,31534578,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:000483312100016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, the ACL has always been and continues to be of great interest to orthopaedic scientists and clinicians worldwide. Major advancements in ACL surgery have been made in the past few years. ACL reconstruction has shifted from an open to arthroscopic procedure, in which a two- and later one-incision technique was applied. Studies have found that traditional, transtibial arthroscopic single-bundle reconstruction does not fully restore rotational stability of the knee joint, and as such, a more anatomic approach to ACL reconstruction has emerged. The goal of anatomic ACL reconstruction is to replicate the knee's normal anatomy and restore its normal kinematics, all while protecting long-term knee health. This manuscript describes the research that has changed the paradigm of ACL reconstruction from traditional techniques to present day anatomic and individualized concepts.","[Fu, Freddie H.; van Eck, Carola F.; Tashman, Scott; Irrgang, James J.; Moreland, Morey S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Fu, FH (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Kaufman Bldg Suite 1011,3471 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",ffu@upmc.edu,"Tashman, Scott/A-8951-2011","Tashman, Scott/0000-0003-0534-3785",Smith and Nephew,Smith and Nephew,The department of Orthopaedic Surgery from the University of Pittsburgh receives funding from Smith and Nephew to support research related to reconstruction of the ACL.,,49,128,167,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0942-2056,1433-7347,,KNEE SURG SPORT TR A,Knee Surg.

Although the majority of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgeries successfully restore the mechanical stability of the injured knee, postsurgical outcomes remain widely varied. Less than half of athletes who undergo ACLR return to sport within the first year after surgery, and it is estimated that approximately 1 in 4 to 1 in 5 young, active athletes who undergo ACLR will go on to a second knee injury. The outcomes after a second knee injury and surgery are significantly less favorable than outcomes after primary injuries. As advances in graft reconstruction and fixation techniques have improved to consistently restore passive joint stability to the preinjury level, successful return to sport after ACLR appears to be predicated on numerous postsurgical factors. Importantly, a secondary ACL injury is most strongly related to modifiable postsurgical risk factors. Biomechanical abnormalities and movement asymmetries, which are more prevalent in this cohort than previously hypothesized, can persist despite high levels of functional performance, and also represent biomechanical and neuromuscular control deficits and imbalances that are strongly associated with secondary injury incidence. Decreased neuromuscular control and high-risk movement biomechanics, which appear to be heavily influenced by abnormal trunk and lower extremity movement patterns, not only predict first knee injury risk but also reinjury risk. These seminal findings indicate that abnormal movement biomechanics and neuromuscular control profiles are likely both residual to, and exacerbated by, the initial injury. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) strategies should be used to develop effective, efficacious interventions targeted to these impairments to optimize the safe return to high-risk activity. In this Current Concepts article, the authors present the latest evidence related to risk factors associated with ligament failure or a secondary (contralateral) injury in athletes who return to sport after ACLR. From these data, they propose an EBM paradigm shift in postoperative rehabilitation and return-to-sport training after ACLR that is focused on the resolution of neuromuscular deficits that commonly persist after surgical reconstruction and standard rehabilitation of athletes.","[Hewett, Timothy E.; Di Stasi, Stephanie L.; Myer, Gregory D.] Ohio State Univ, Sports Hlth & Performance Inst, Columbus, OH 43221 USA; [Hewett, Timothy E.; Di Stasi, Stephanie L.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Physiol & Cell Biol, Columbus, OH 43221 USA; [Hewett, Timothy E.; Di Stasi, Stephanie L.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Columbus, OH 43221 USA; [Hewett, Timothy E.; Di Stasi, Stephanie L.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Family Med, Columbus, OH 43221 USA; [Hewett, Timothy E.; Di Stasi, Stephanie L.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Columbus, OH 43221 USA; [Myer, Gregory D.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Allied Med Profess, Athlet Training Div, Columbus, OH 43221 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Hewett, TE (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sports Hlth & Performance Inst, 2050 Kenny Rd,Suite 3100, Columbus, OH 43221 USA.",tim.hewett@osumc.edu,"Hewett, Timothy/G-1023-2011; Myer, Gregory/KRP-5234-2024; Di Stasi, Stephanie/HRD-6780-2023","Hewett, Timothy/0000-0001-9729-7573; Myer, Gregory/0000-0002-9983-8422;","National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIH/NIAMS) [R01-AR049735, R01-AR05563, R01-AR056259]; National Football League (NFL) Charities; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [R01AR055563] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIH/NIAMS)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS)); National Football League (NFL) Charities; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS)),"One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: Funding support received from National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIH/NIAMS) grants R01-AR049735, R01-AR05563, and R01-AR056259.

While a number of factors have been identified as potentially increasing the risk of subsequent ACL injury, the literature is far from definitive. Purpose: To determine the rates of graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury in a large cohort and to investigate patient characteristics that may be associated with these. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A consecutive cohort of 750 patients who had undergone primary ACL reconstruction surgery with a minimum 3-year follow-up were questioned about the incidence of ACL graft rupture, contralateral ACL injury, family history of ACL injury, and current activity level. Patient databases provided details for age, sex, original injury mechanism, meniscus or articular surface injury, and graft diameter. Results: Responses were received from 561 patients (75%) at a mean SD follow-up time of 4.8 +/- 1.1 years. Anterior cruciate ligament graft ruptures occurred in 25 patients (4.5%), and contralateral ACL injuries occurred in 42 patients (7.5%). The highest incidence of further ACL injury occurred in patients younger than 20 years at the time of surgery. In this group, 29% sustained a subsequent ACL injury to either knee. The odds for sustaining an ACL graft rupture or contralateral injury increased 6- and 3-fold, respectively, for patients younger than 20 years. Returning to cutting/pivoting sports increased the odds of graft rupture by a factor of 3.9 and contralateral rupture by a factor of 5. A positive family history doubled the odds for both graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury. Conclusion: Patients younger than 20 years who undergo ACL reconstruction are at significantly increased risk for both graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury. Whether age per se is a risk factor or age represents a proxy for other factors remains to be determined.","Epworth HealthCare, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; La Trobe Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University,"Webster, KE (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Allied Hlth, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",k.webster@latrobe.edu.au,,,Perpetual I8 grant,Perpetual I8 grant,One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: This study was partly funded by a Perpetual I8 grant (to J.A.F. and K.E.W.).,,31,406,470,3,55,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

However, a significant subset of patients continue to report residual symptoms of instability with a poor pivot control. Cadaveric biomechanical studies have shown double bundle (DB) ACL reconstructions to restore the knee kinematics better. This study evaluates the outcome of DB ACL reconstruction. Materials and Methods: 30 consecutive patients who underwent anatomic DB ACL reconstruction were included in this prospective longitudinal study. There were all males with a mean age of 25 +/- 7.45 years. All patients were prospectively evaluated using GeNouRoB (GNRB) arthrometer, functional knee scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Lysholm) and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for comparing the graft orientation and footprint of the reconstructed ACL with that of the normal knee. Results: The average followup was 36.2 months. At the time of final followup the mean Lysholm score was 93.13 +/- 3.31. As per the objective IKDC score, 26 patients (86.6%) were in Group A while 4 patients (13.3%) were in Group B. The mean differential anterior tibial translation by GNRB, arthrometer was 1.07 +/- 0.8 mm (range 0.1-2.3 mm). All cases had a negative pivot shift test. MRI scans of operated and the contralateral normal knee showed the mean sagittal ACL tibial angle coronal ACL tibial angle and tibial ACL footprint to be in accordance with the values of the contralateral, normal knee. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that DB ACL reconstruction restores the ACL anatomically in terms of size and angle of orientation. However, long term studies are needed to further substantiate its role in decreasing the incidence of early osteoarthritic changes compared to the conventional single bundle reconstructions.","[Devgan, Ashish; Singh, Amanpreet; Gogna, Paritosh; Singla, Rohit; Magu, Narender Kumar; Mukhopadhyay, Reetadyuti] PGIMS, Dept Orthopaed & Rehabil, Rohtak 124001, Haryana, India","Pt.

The present study investigated the same cohort of patients after a minimum of three years to evaluate whether the residual valgus laxity led to a poorer clinical outcome. Each patient had undergone an arthroscopic double-bundle ACL reconstruction using a semitendinosus-gracilis graft. In the combined ACL/MCL injury group, the grade II medial collateral ligament injury was not treated. At follow-up, AP laxity was measured using a KT-2000 arthrometer, while valgus laxity was evaluated with Telos valgus stress radiographs and compared with the uninjured knee. We evaluated clinical outcome scores, muscle girth and time to return to activities for the two groups. Valgus stress radiographs showed statistically significant greater mean medial joint opening in the reconstructed compared with the uninjured knees (1.7 mm (SD 0.9) versus 0.9 mm (SD 0.7), respectively, p = 0.013), while no statistically significant difference was found between the AP laxity and the other clinical parameters. Our results show that the residual valgus laxity does not affect AP laxity significantly at a minimum follow up of three years, suggesting that no additional surgical procedure is needed for the medial collateral ligament in combined lesions.","[Zaffagnini, S.; Bonanzinga, T.; Muccioli, G.

Bone patellar tendon-bone and the hamstring tendon generally have been used. In the present study, we describe an alternative graft, the quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft, by using arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Methods: From March of 1996 through March of 1997, a quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft was used in 12 patients with ACL injuries, Results: After 15 to 24 months of follow-up, the clinical outcome for those patients with this graft have been encouraging. Ten patients could return to the same or a higher level of preinjury sports activity. According to the International Knee Documentation Committee rating system, 10 of the 12 patients had normal or nearly normal ratings. Recovery of quadriceps muscle strength to 80% of the normal knee was achieved in 11 patients in 1 year, Conclusion: The advantages of the quadriceps tendon graft include the following: the graft is larger and stronger than the patellar tendon; morbidity of harvest technique and donor site is less than that of patellar tendon graft; there is little quadriceps inhibition after quadriceps harvest: there is quicker return to sports activities with aggressive rehabilitation. A quadriceps tendon-patellar autograft is a reasonable alternative to ACL reconstruction in patients who are not suitable for either a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft.","Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan",Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,"Chen, CH (corresponding author), Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 5 Fu-Hsin St, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,18,53,58,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",1079-6061,,,J TRAUMA,J.

Recently, the renewed focus of ACL reconstruction has been to restore the anatomy of the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion sites. The goal of ACL reconstruction is to restore normal knee kinematics, to enable patients to return to their preinjury level of activity, and to prevent further degenerative changes of the articular knee cartilage. Anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction has recently gained popularity as a concept that can be used to achieve these goals.

The ACL consists of 2 functional bundles the anteromedial and posterolateral which are named for the position of their insertion sites on the tibia. Anatomic ACL reconstruction can be defined as the restoration of the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion sites. Some biomechanical studies have demonstrated that anatomic ACL reconstruction can restore knee motion significantly similar to that of the normal knee, as compared with traditional, nonanatomic single-bundle procedures. In vivo kinematic studies have also shown that nonanatomic single-bundle reconstruction fails to restore normal dynamic knee stability in all cases. Accurate restoration of knee kinematics with anatomic ACL reconstruction is critical to protect against the possibility that nonatomic sugical technique could result in early osteoarthritis, which is common in patients who sustain ACL tears. Surgical techniques for ACL reconstruction vary, and if different aspects of the surgery are compared for superiority (eg, single- vs double-bundle techniques), it is necessary that both procedures meet criteria to be designated as anatomic. By emphasizing the importance of restoring the native anatomy of the knee, surgeons can give their patients the best chance at restoration of joint function and preservation of long-term knee health.","[van Eck, Carola; Working, Zachary; Fu, Freddie] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Fu, F (corresponding author), Kaufman Bldg,Suite 1011,3471 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",ffu@upmc.edu,"Working, Zachary/AAT-6760-2021","Working, Zachary/0000-0003-1768-1001",,,,,80,11,11,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3847,2326-3660,,PHYSICIAN SPORTSMED,Physician Sportsmed.,MAY,2011,39,2,,,,,140,148,,10.3810/psm.2011.05.1905,http://dx.doi.org/10.3810/psm.2011.05.1905,,,9,Primary Health Care; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences,818HN,21673495,,,,2025-12-29,WOS:000294742600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

These 2 bundles have different roles in the control of knee stability. The AMB essentially controls the anterior tibial translation, whereas the PLB mainly controls the rotatory stability of the knee by limiting the internal rotation of the lateral tibial plateau. Current techniques for reconstruction do not completely reproduce the anatomy and function of the ACL. They address only the anteromedial bundle, which does not fully restore ACL function throughout the arc of motion. Current grafts control the anterior tibial subluxation near extension but are less efficacious in providing rotatory stability. Recently several authors have suggested reconstructing not only the anteromedial bundle, but also the posterolateral bundle. After discussing the relevant anatomical and biomechanical data, this article describes a double-bundle ACL reconstruction technique using hamstring tendons routed through 2 tibial and 2 femoral independent tunnels. Short-term results of this technique are encouraging; however, long-term follow-up studies are needed to compare the outcome of a more physiologic double-bundle ACL reconstruction with single-bundle techniques.","[Christel, Pascal; Djian, Patrick] Inst Appareil Locomoteur Nollet, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Paris, France; [Christel, Pascal; Franceschi, Jean Pierre] Hop Prive Paul dEgine, Champigny Sur Mame, France; [Sbihi, Abdou] Hop Conception, Serv Prof Curvale, Marseille, France; [Colombet, Philippe] CCOS Merignac, Merignac, France; [Djian, Patrick; Bellier, Guy] Cabinet Goethe, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille,"Christel, P (corresponding author), Inst Appareil Locomoteur Nollet, 23 Rue Brochant, F-75017 Paris, France.",pchristl@noos.fr,,,,,,,26,23,25,0,0,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",1048-6666,1558-3848,,OPER TECH ORTHOP,Oper.

Patients' scores of Cincinnati, IKDC and Lysholm were respectively, preoperative 18.1, 39.3 and 39.8, while the post-op increased to 27.2, 76.3 and 86.3. In their last check, 17 percent of the patients according to IKDC scores (85%) A (excellent) and B (good) group and 3 patients took place as C (adequate) group. The power measurements of quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups of patients who underwent surgery showed no significant difference compared with the intact knees. Discussion: Double-bundle ACL reconstruction is a satisfactory method. There is a need comparative, long-term studies in large numbers in order to determine improving clinical outcome, preventing degeneration and restoring the knee biomechanics better.","[Pepele, Demet] Malatya Devlet Hastanesi, Ortopedi & Travamatol Klin, Malatya, Turkey; [Karakaplan, Mustafa; Elmali, Nurzat; Topgul, Haldun; Ozen, Metehan] Inonu Univ, Tip Fak, Ortopedi & Travmatol Anabilim Dali, TR-44069 Malatya, Turkey",Malatya State Hospital; Inonu University,"Elmali, N (corresponding author), Inonu Univ, Tip Fak, Ortopedi & Travmatol Anabilim Dali, TR-44069 Malatya, Turkey.",nelmali@hotmail.com,"Elmali, Nurzat/A-1017-2014; Ozen, Metehan/X-2705-2018; karakaplan, mustafa/IXN-3318-2023","Ozen, Metehan/0000-0003-4088-3103; karakaplan, mustafa/0000-0001-9035-0319",,,,,29,0,0,0,3,DERMAN MEDICAL PUBL,ANKARA,"KARTALTEPE MAHALLESI, ATATURK BULVARI, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1309-0720,1309-2014,,J CLIN ANAL MED,J.

No consensus exists regarding the best treatment method. This work presents a method of 1-stage ACL and PCL reconstruction in which a contralateral quadriceps tendon-bone autograft with tibial inlay technique is used for the PCL and contralateral hamstring tendon autograft with suspension fixation is used for the ACL. After harvesting grafts, the patient is put in the lateral decubitus position. Under arthroscopy, the femoral tunnel for the anterolateral bundle of the PCL is created using an 8-mm reamer via a prepositioned guide pin. Next, the tibial tunnel of the ACL is created with an appropriate diameter cannulated reamer. Directed by the femoral guide instrument with a 7-mm offset, a guide pin is positioned retrograde through the tibial tunnel. A reamer is then used to create a 35-mm long closed-ended femoral tunnel for the ACL. A posterior arthrotomy for the PCL inlay technique is performed. After capsulotomy, a unicortical window is created at the footprint of the PCL and the inlay graft is fixed using a 3.5mm-cancellous screw and washer. The PCL graft is then passed into the femoral tunnel. The ACL graft is passed in a retrograde fashion using the Beath pin. The ACL graft is fixed by tying with a washer on the femoral side and by tying with a screw on the tibial side. The PCL graft is then fixed on the femoral side.","Taipei Med Univ, Wan Fang Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Taipei, Taiwan; Chang Gung Mem Hosp Keelung, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Keelung, Taiwan; E Da Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Taipei Municipal WanFang Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; E-Da Hospital,"Chen, CH (corresponding author), Chang Gung Mem Hosp Keelung, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 222 Mai Chin Rd, Keelung, Taiwan.",afachen@doctor.com,,,,,,,35,9,10,0,1,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0749-8063,1526-3231,,ARTHROSCOPY,Arthroscopy,MAR,2006,22,3,,,,,,,339.e1-339.e7,10.1016/j.artho.2005.11.012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artho.2005.11.012,,,7,Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,024EP,,,,,2025-12-29,WOS:000236178600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

It was hypothesized that anatomic DB ACLR would result in better International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) scores and reduced anterior and rotatory laxity compared to SB ACLR. Methods Active individuals between 14 and 50 years of age that presented within 12 months of injury were eligible to participate. Individuals with prior injury or surgery of either knee, greater than a grade 1 concomitant knee ligament injury, or ACL insertion sites less than 14 mm or greater than 18 mm were excluded. Subjects were randomized to undergo SB or DB ACLR with a 10 mm-wide quadriceps tendon autograft harvested with a patellar bone block and were followed for 24 months. The primary outcome measures included the IKDC-SKF and KT-1000 (side to side difference) and pivot shift tests. Other secondary outcomes included measures of sports activity and participation, range of motion (ROM) and re-injury. Results Enrollment in the study was suspended due to patellar fractures related to harvest of the patellar bone plug. At that time, 57 subjects had been randomized (29 DB) and two-year follow-up was attained from 51 (89.5%). At 24-month follow-up there were no between-group differences detected for the primary outcomes. Twenty-one (77.8%) DB's and 20 (83.3%) SB's reported returning to pre-injury sports 2 years after surgery (n.s) Three subjects (2 DB's, 5.3% of total) sustained a graft rupture and 5 individuals (4 SB's, 8.8% of total) had a subsequent meniscus injury. Conclusions Due to the early termination of the study, there were no detectable differences in clinical outcome between anatomic SB and DB ACLR when performed with a quadriceps tendon autograft with a bone block in individuals with ACL insertion sites that range from 14 to 18 mm.","[Irrgang, James J.; Patterson, Charity G.; Poploski, Kathleen] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Dept Phys Therapy, Suite 210,Bridgeside Point 1,100 Technol Dr, Pittsburgh, PA 15203 USA; [Irrgang, James J.; Musahl, Volker; Fu, Freddie H. .] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Tashman, Scott] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Vail, CO USA; [Musahl, Volker; Oostdyk, Alicia; Galvin, Bryan; Fu, Freddie H. .] UPMC Freddie Fu Sports Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [West, Robin] Inova Sports Med, Fairfax, VA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Steadman Philippon Research Institute,"Irrgang, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Dept Phys Therapy, Suite 210,Bridgeside Point 1,100 Technol Dr, Pittsburgh, PA 15203 USA.;Irrgang, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",jirrgang@pitt.edu,"Musahl, Volker/HHD-1853-2022; Tashman, Scott/A-8951-2011; Poploski, Kathleen/AAE-2751-2022","Oostdyk, Alicia/0000-0003-4965-9298",National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [1R01 AR056630-01A2],National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS)),National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (1R01 AR056630-01A2).,,28,29,33,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0942-2056,1433-7347,,KNEE SURG SPORT TR A,Knee Surg.

Although anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has come a long way, the causes of failure have yet to be fully understood. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not the intraoperative 4-strand hamstring autograft diameter does in fact influence the failure rates of ACLR. Methods: Retrospective intraoperative data were collected from ACLR patients from the only tertiary center available in Kuwait. Patients who underwent ACLR from 2012 to 2018 for isolated ACL injuries were included in this study, allowing for a 24 month follow-up period The cohorts were categorized into 3 groups: patients with graft size <= 8mm, 2, patients with graft sizes >= 8mm with 4-strands and patients with graft sizes >= 8mm with 4-strands or more. ANOVA analysis was applied to address group differences between mean graft size and strand numbers and subsequently the failure rates for each group. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to investigate the relationship between revision and initial ACL graft size. Results: Out of the 711 out of 782 patients were included in this study. Only 42.6% of the patients did not need more than 4-strands to achieve an 8mm sized autograft. The patients who had autografts <= 8mm in this study accounted for 17.1% of the population. About 7.2% of these patients required revision surgery. Patients with a 4-strand autograft size that was less than 8mm were 7.2 times more at risk for ACLR failure (RR=7.2, 95% CI: 6.02; 8.35, p=0.007).

This has resulted in a more individualized approach to ACLR. Several studies have shown that the size of the anterior cruciate ligament insertion sites is variable; however, these studies are limited by use of relatively small sample sizes and cadaveric specimens. Purpose: This study was undertaken to evaluate the in vivo size variability of the anterior cruciate ligament insertion sites and its AM and PL bundles during arthroscopy in a large series of patients and to correlate these findings with individuals' physical characteristics (height, weight, and body mass index). Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: In 137 patients undergoing ACLR during the first 6 months after injury, the femoral and tibial anterior cruciate ligament insertion sites and the 2 bundles were identified, marked with electrocautery, and measured with an arthroscopic ruler. Additionally, physical characteristics of the patients, including self-reported height, weight, and body mass index, were recorded. Results: The tibial anterior cruciate ligament insertion site had a mean length of 17.0 +/- 2.0 mm. The tibial AM bundle length was 9.1 +/- 1.2 mm and the width was 9.2 +/- 1.1 mm. The tibial PL bundle insertion site length averaged 7.4 +/- 1.0 mm and the width averaged 7.0 +/- 1.0 mm. The femoral insertion sites had a mean length of 16.5 +/- 2.0 mm. The length of the femoral AM bundle insertion site averaged 9.2 +/- 1.2 mm and the width averaged 8.9 +/- 0.9 mm. The femoral PL bundle insertion site length averaged 7.1 +/- 1.1 mm and the width averaged 6.9 +/- 1.0 mm. There were significant positive correlations between patient height and weight (P < .05) with femoral and tibial anterior cruciate ligament insertion site length, tibial PL bundle insertion site length, femoral AM bundle insertion site length, and tibial AM bundle and PL bundle insertion site areas. However, the coefficients of determination values were low (1.0% to 19.4%). Conclusion: There is a large variation in size of the anterior cruciate ligament insertion sites and the AM and PL bundles. Additionally, there are significant but weak correlations between the size of the insertions and height, weight, and body mass index of the individual patient.","[Fu, Freddie H.] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Fu, FH (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 3471 5th Ave,Suite 1011, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",ffu@upmc.edu,"Kopf, Sebastian/J-1207-2019","Kopf, Sebastian/0000-0003-4373-7144",Smith Nephew,Smith Nephew,"One or more authors has declared a potential conflict of interest: The study was performed at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, which receives research funding from Smith & Nephew to support research related to anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.",,28,122,145,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Clinical information was retrospectively collected for 41 cases suffering anterior cruciate ligament injuries accompanied by grade 2 medial collateral ligament injuries. Within 14 days after their injuries 22 cases received single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (SB group), while 19 were treated with double-bundle medial collateral ligament reconstruction (DB group). Physical statuses were estimated based on International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, Lachman, pivot shift and manual valgus test, and range of motion (ROM), while side-to-side difference was estimated through KT 2000 arthometer. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction accompanied by conservative treatment showed significantly improved anteroposterior, rotational and valgus stability, and IKDC and Lysholm scores (in comparison to pre-operative status, P < .05). Incidence of pivot shift was dramatically lower in DB group (2/19) than in SB group (7/22 and 2/22; P = .028). No substantial dissimilarity existed between DB and SB groups either in Lachman and valgus tests, KT 2000, ROM, IKDC, or Lysholm scores.

Moreover, double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is superior to single-bundle operation in treating rotational instability of the knee.","[Chen, Lian-Xu] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hosp, Sch Clin Med, Dept Orthopaed, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hong-Hong] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dept Emergency, Affiliated Hosp 3, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine,"Wang, HH (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dept Emergency, Affiliated Hosp 3, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bfghhh@126.com,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,15,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),MAR 19,2021,100,11,,,,,,,e24846,10.1097/MD.0000000000024846,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000024846,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,SO6BS,33725956,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:000659055900037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was initially performed using an open approach. When the approach changed from open to arthroscopic reconstruction, a 2- and, later, 1-incision technique was applied. With time, researchers found that traditional arthroscopic single-bundle reconstruction did not fully restore rotational stability of the knee joint and a more anatomic approach to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament has been proposed. Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction intends to replicate normal anatomy, restore normal kinematics, and protect long-term knee health. Although double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has been shown to result in better rotational stability in both biomechanical and clinical studies, it is vital to differentiate between anatomic and double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The latter is merely a step closer to reproducing the native anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament; however, it can still be done nonanatomically. To evaluate the potential benefits of reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament in an anatomic fashion, accurate, precise, and reliable outcome measures are needed. These include, for example, T2 magnetic resonance imaging mapping of cartilage and quantification of graft healing on magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, there is a need for a consensus on which patient-reported outcome measures should be used to facilitate homogeneous reporting of outcomes.","[Karlsson, Jon; Samuelsson, Kristian] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Molndal, Sweden; [Irrgang, James J.; van Eck, Carola F.; Mejia, Hector A.; Fu, Freddie H.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Sahlgrenska University Hospital; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Fu, FH (corresponding author), Kaufman Bldg Suite 1011,3471 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",ffu@upmc.edu,,"Samuelsson, Kristian/0000-0001-5383-3370",Smith Nephew,Smith Nephew,One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of the University of Pittsburgh receives funding from Smith & Nephew to support research related to reconstruction of the ACL.,,80,107,123,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is the current standard for the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament deficiency. However, a significant subset of patients continues to report residual symptoms of instability after such reconstruction. Hypothesis: Anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may more closely restore normal kinematics of the knee by reproducing the native anatomy. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: We report the current clinical outcomes of the initial 100 consecutive patients who underwent anatomic doublebundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with an average follow-up of 2.1 +/- 0.5 years. All patients were prospectively followed to document range of motion, ligamentous laxity, and functional strength, as well as activity and sports participation. Results: Side-to-side difference in range of motion was 2 degrees +/- 3 degrees for extension and 2 degrees +/- 5 degrees for flexion. Sixty-five percent of patients had a normal Lachman test result, and 33% were nearly normal. For the pivot-shift test findings, 94% were normal, and 6% were nearly normal. The average side-to-side difference in the KT-2000 arthrometer test was 1.0 +/- 2.3 mm. There were 8 graft failures, 7 of which had subsequent revision surgery. No patients reported pain, swelling, or instability during activities of daily living, and 73% to 78% had no symptoms during very strenuous or strenuous sports activities. The scores of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form, Activities of Daily Living, and Sports Activity Scores of the Knee Outcome Survey were 85.0, 91.8, and 87.0, respectively, and were similar compared with patients undergoing single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which we have previously reported. Fifty-one percent described their current activity level as normal, and 35% reported it as nearly normal. Conclusion: Anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction results in good restoration of joint stability and patient-reported outcomes when evaluated 2 years after surgery.","[Fu, Freddie H.] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Fu, FH (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 3471,5th Ave,Suite 1011, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",ffu@upmc.edu,,,,,,,67,153,179,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Hypothesis: The outcome of a revised anterior cruciate ligament surgery is comparable to primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, with a rate of success around 70% to 80%. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 66 revisions of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were carried out from September 2000 to September 2004. Patients with concomitant instability and those with alterations in the weightbearing axis of the lower limbs were not included. Sixty patients were followed from 24 to 72 months: 50 clinically and 10 by a phone interview. Six patients were lost to follow-up due to changes of address. Results: Lysholm scores were 57% excellent (95-100 points), 13% good (84-94 points), 22% fair (63-83 points), and 8% poor (<64 points). A total of 68% of patients had negative Lachman tests, 20% had positive tests with a hard end point, 10% had positive results, and 2% had very positive results. Stabilometric evaluation with the KT-1000 arthrometer at the maximum load showed that 56% of patients had <3 mm side-to-side difference, 34% had between 3 and 5 mm, and 10% had 6 to 10 mm. The International Knee Documentation Committee scores were 36% excellent (class A), 46% good (class B), and 18% fair (class C). The percentage of patients who resumed sport at the same level was 78%, compared with 58% after their primary reconstruction. Conclusion: The results of these anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction revision surgeries are close to those achieved by other series of primary reconstructions with a little less satisfactory results. We attribute the high success rate to the strict application of the same technique and the confinement of revision to motivated patients. It should be noted, however, that follow-up is only at the midterm stage (mean, 41.9 months).","[Denti, Matteo] IRCCS, Ist Ortoped Galeazzi, Ctr Traumatol Sport & Chirurg Artroscop, Sports Traumatol & Arthroscop Surg Unit, I-20161 Milan, Italy",IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi,"Denti, M (corresponding author), IRCCS, Ist Ortoped Galeazzi, Ctr Traumatol Sport & Chirurg Artroscop, Sports Traumatol & Arthroscop Surg Unit, Via Galeazzi 4, I-20161 Milan, Italy.",matteo@denti.ch.it,,"Bait, Corrado/0009-0000-5464-4344; Volpi, Piero/0000-0001-7938-4964",,,,,66,67,79,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

This technique represents a novel approach to restore the anteromedial and the posterolateral bundle at their anatomic insertion sites on both the tibia and the femur through separate bone tunnels.

Purpose: To assess clinical outcome for patients with chronic anterior cruciate ligament injury and accompanying grade II valgus laxity who received medial hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction alone. Results were compared with those of patients with isolated chronic anterior cruciate ligament injury without valgus laxity. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Two hundred eighty-nine patients with isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury were compared with 53 patients with accompanying valgus laxity (minimum follow-up, 24 months). The following parameters were compared between the 2 groups at the last follow-up: range of motion, KT-1000 arthrometer value, pivot-shift test result, Lysholm knee scale, knee extensor muscle strength, return to sporting activities, subjective recovery, and International Knee Documentation Committee grade. Differences in clinical outcome were evaluated between those with preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee grade 8 and grade C and between those with grade A and grade B or C at final evaluation. Results: Postoperative KT-1 000 arthrometer value averaged 1.2 mm for those with isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury and 1.6 mm for those with accompanying valgus laxity (not significant, P =.281). There was no significant difference between these 2 groups regarding the other items. In patients with preoperative valgus laxity, KT-1000 arthrometer values at final evaluation between patients with preoperative grade B and C were not significantly different. The value for subjects with grade A at final evaluation was 1.3 mm and for those with grade B or C at final evaluation was 2.7 mm (P =.065). Conclusion: There was no clinically significant difference regarding outcome of anterior cruciate ligament multistrand hamstring reconstruction alone for 90% of patients with grade II valgus laxity who regained medial stability with nonoperative management compared with those who underwent the same anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for an isolated anterior cruciate ligament tear.","[Hara, Kenji; Muneta, Takeshi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch, Sect Orthopaed Surg, Div BioMatrix, Tokyo 1138519, Japan; [Hara, Kenji; Niga, Sadao; Lkeda, Hiroo; Cho, Sadahiro] Kawaguchi Kohgyo Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan",Institute of Science Tokyo; Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU),"Hara, K (corresponding author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch, Sect Orthopaed Surg, Div BioMatrix, 1-5-45 Yushima, Tokyo 1138519, Japan.",k-hara.orth@tmd.ac.jp,,"Muneta, Takeshi/0000-0003-1018-2939",,,,,26,33,34,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Expanding the range of donors and tendons could help offset an increasing clinical demand. Purpose: To investigate the effects of donor age, sex, height, and specific tendon on the mechanical properties of a range of human lower leg tendons. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Nine tendons were retrieved from 39 fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs (35 donors [13 female, 22 male]; age, 49-99 years; height, 57-85 inches [145-216 cm]) including: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior and anterior, fibularis longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, plantaris, and flexor digitorum longus. Tendons underwent tensile loading to failure measuring cross-sectional area (CSA), maximum load, strain at failure, ultimate tensile strength, and elastic modulus. Results from 332 tendons were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for donor age, sex, height, and weight. Results: Mechanical properties were significantly different among tendons and were substantially greater than the effects of donor characteristics. Significant effects of donor sex, age, and height were limited to specific tendons: Achilles tendon, tibialis posterior, and tibialis anterior. All other tendons were unaffected. The Achilles tendon was most influenced by donor variables: greater CSA in men (beta = 15.45 mm(2); Sidak adjusted P < .0001), decreased maximum load with each year of increased age (beta = -17.20 N per year; adjusted P = .0253), and increased CSA (beta = 1.92 mm(2) per inch; adjusted P < .0001) and maximum load (beta = 86.40 N per inch; adjusted P < .0001) with each inch of increased height. Conclusion: Mechanical properties vary significantly across different human tendons. The effects of donor age, sex, and height are relatively small, are limited to specific tendons, and affect different tendons uniquely. The findings indicate that age negatively affected only the Achilles tendon (maximum load) and challenge the exclusion of donors aged >65 years across all tendon grafts.","[Ashton, Dylan M.; Blaker, Carina L.; Hartnell, Nicholas; Haubruck, Patrick; Hefferan, Samantha A.; Little, Christopher B.; Clarke, Elizabeth C.] Univ Sydney, St Leonards, Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, Sydney, Australia",University of Sydney; Northern Sydney Local Health District,"Clarke, EC (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, St Leonards, Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, Sydney, Australia.",elizabeth.clarke@sydney.edu.au,"Ashton, Dylan/NZO-0461-2025; Blaker, Carina/NEU-7301-2025; Little, Christopher B/A-9280-2015; Clarke, Elizabeth/H-3274-2014; Haubruck, Patrick/MBH-7351-2025","Ashton, Dylan/0000-0002-8573-3216; Blaker, Carina/0000-0003-2264-6702; , Sam/0000-0002-4610-8258; Little, Christopher B/0000-0002-0353-7634;",,,,,42,11,12,2,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

The intricate coordination of joint movements relies heavily on the ACL's screw -home mechanism, a crucial element for synchronizing knee movement with neighboring joints. Despite its indispensable role, the ACL is susceptible to injury, necessitating surgical intervention. While many patients experience positive outcomes following ACL reconstruction surgeries, a significant proportion face the challenge of procedure failure. The key to success lies in the healing process within the tibial and femoral bone tunnels. The post-ACL reconstruction phase introduces its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of returning to sports (RTS), underscoring the importance of reinstating neuromuscular and motor function. The trajectory of rehabilitation is influenced by factors such as graft healing, patient age, gender, pain levels, and concurrent injuries. Materials and methods This prospective observational study spanned 2.5 years, enrolling 71 patients with diagnosed ACL injuries. Arthroscopic reconstruction utilized hamstring autografts and peroneus longus autografts. A nine -month post -surgery follow-up employed the Lysholm scoring system for comprehensive evaluations. Results Over 2.5 years, 87.3% of male and 12.6% of female participants underwent arthroscopic reconstruction. Lysholm scores revealed 28.1% excellent, 45.0% good, and 26.7% fair outcomes, with no participants in the unsatisfactory range. Lysholm scores demonstrated positive outcomes, indicating the efficacy of arthroscopic reconstruction in enhancing knee function. Findings align with existing literature, emphasizing positive results from ACL reconstruction techniques and specific implants. Comparisons with related studies highlight challenges in standardized return -to -sport guidelines and underscore the need for outcome measure standardization. Conclusion The study contributes nuanced insights into ACL reconstruction outcomes, emphasizing positive functional recovery trends at the nine -month follow-up. Lysholm scores indicate favorable outcomes, supporting the procedure's effectiveness. Consideration of specific implants adds practical value. Despite limitations, this study enriches ACL reconstruction research, promoting advancements in patient care and outcomes. Ongoing research with extended follow-ups and larger cohorts will enhance understanding and refine ACL reconstruction strategies.","[Soni, Sanjay; Brahmbhatt, Vinit; Tolani, Mohit; Soni, Hemant; Shroff, Manan] Bhaikaka Univ, Pramukhswami Med Coll, Dept Orthoped, Anand, India; [Pathan, Sohilkhan R.; Sharma, Kruti B.] Shree Krishna Hosp, Bhanubhai & Madhuben Patel Cardiac Ctr, Clin Res Serv, Anand, India",,"Soni, S (corresponding author), Bhaikaka Univ, Pramukhswami Med Coll, Dept Orthoped, Anand, India.",sanjaysoni.doc@gmail.com,"Sharma, Kruti/IAN-0721-2023; Pathan, Sohilkhan R/HKO-2478-2023","Sharma, Kruti/0000-0002-1461-2978; Pathan, Sohilkhan R/0000-0002-5381-9621; Soni, Hemant/0000-0001-7461-9824",,,,,26,1,2,2,4,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2168-8184,,CUREUS J MED SCIENCE,Cureus J Med Sci,FEB 3,2024,16,2,,,,,,,e53480,10.7759/cureus.53480,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.53480,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),General & Internal Medicine,IP8S7,38440040,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:001167631100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Purpose: To investigate the effect of sectioning the ACL and posterolateral knee structures on lateral compartment gapping under varus stress. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fourteen nonpaired cadaveric knees were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: sequential sectioning of the ACL, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), and popliteofibular ligament (PFL) (ACL-first group) or sequential sectioning of the FCL, PLT, PFL, and ACL (FCL-first group). Knees were loaded onto a custom jig at a 20 degrees flexion angle. A standardized 12-N center dot m varus moment was applied to each specimen in the intact state and after each randomized sequential-sectioning state. Lateral compartment opening was measured on radiographs to assess the contribution to the increase in the lateral gap caused by resecting the respective structure. The distance was measured by 3 observers on 15 images (5 testing states each imaged 3 times) per specimen, for a total of 210 radiographs. The articular cartilage surfaces were not included in the measurements. Results: The mean increase in lateral opening after sectioning all structures (ACL and posterolateral corner) was 4.6 +/- 1.8 mm (range, 1.9-7.7 mm). The ACL and FCL sectioning contributed the most to lateral knee opening (1.3 +/- 0.6 and 2.2 +/- 1.3 mm, respectively). In both groups, lateral gapping >3 mm was achieved only after both the ACL and FCL were sectioned. All comparisons of increased mean gapping distances demonstrated a significant difference with subsequent sequential sectioning of structures, except comparisons between the FCL and PLT and the PLT and PFL. When considering the effect of the ACL on lateral opening, no significant difference was found between sectioning the ACL first or FCL first (P = .387). Conclusion: ACL deficiency significantly increased lateral opening under varus stress, regardless of the sequence of injury. The effect of injury to the ACL in addition to the lateral structures should be considered when using varus stress radiographs to evaluate knee injuries.","[Gursoy, Safa; Perry, Allison K.; Dandu, Navya; Singh, Harsh; Vadhera, Amar S.; Yanke, Adam; LaPrade, Robert F.; Chahla, Jorge] Midwest Orthopaed Rush, Chicago, IL USA; [Gursoy, Safa; Perry, Allison K.; Dandu, Navya; Singh, Harsh; Vadhera, Amar S.; Yanke, Adam; Chahla, Jorge] Rush Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Med Ctr, 1611 W Harrison St,Suite 300, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [LaPrade, Robert F.] Twin Cities Orthoped, Edina, MN USA",Rush University; Rush University; Twin Cities Orthopedics,"Chahla, J (corresponding author), Rush Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Med Ctr, 1611 W Harrison St,Suite 300, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",Jorge.Chahla@rushortho.com,"gursoy, safa/KMA-3773-2024; Singh, Harsh/KRP-9033-2024; LaPrade, Robert/AFA-8673-2022","LaPrade, Robert/0000-0002-9823-2306",,,,,29,5,5,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,2325-9671,,ORTHOP J SPORTS MED,Orthop.

The side-to-side difference in heel height can represent a valuable diagnostic tool in the setting of multiligamentous injuries. Purpose: To assess in a cadaveric model how sequential sectioning of the static stabilizing structures of the knee (ACL, fibular collateral ligament [FCL], popliteus tendon [PLT], popliteofibular ligament [PFL], and medial collateral ligament [MCL]) influences heel-height measurements when comparing groups undergoing initial transection of the ACL versus FCL and to assess posterior tibial slope after sequential sectioning. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 16 fresh cadaveric knees were carefully dissected to expose the ACL, FCL, PLT, PFL, and MCL. Each knee was randomized to either the ACL-first or FCL-first group based on the initial structure sectioned. The sectioning order was as follows: (1) ACL or FCL, (2) FCL or ACL, (3) PLT, (4) PFL, and (5) MCL. Heel height was measured with a standardized superiorly directed 12-N center dot m force applied to the knee while stabilizing the femur; heel height was also measured with a clinician-applied force. The measurements were compared between and within groups for each sectioned state. The correlation between tibial slope and heel-height measurements was analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in heel-height measurements between the ACL-first and FCL-first groups (P = .863). Combined ACL-FCL injuries led to a 2.85 +/- 0.83-cm increase in heel height compared to the intact state. Significant increases in heel height occurred after all sectioned states, except the PFL sectioned state. Combined ACL-posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries resulted in a 3.72 +/- 1.02-cm increase in heel height, and additional sectioning of the MCL resulted in a 4.73 +/- 1.35-cm increase compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not correlated with increases in heel height after each sectioning (P = .154). Conclusion: Combined ACL-FCL, ACL-PLC, and ACL-PLC-MCL injuries resulted in increasing mean heel-height measurements (2.85, 3.72, and 4.73 cm, respectively) compared to the intact state. Tibial slope was not found to influence increases in heel height.","[Perry, Allison K.; Knapik, Derrick M.; Gursoy, Safa; Alter, Thomas D.; Clapp, Ian M.; Verma, Nikhil N.; Chahla, Jorge] Rush Univ, Midwest Orthopaed Rush, Med Ctr, 1611 West Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [LaPrade, Robert F.] Twin Cities Orthoped, Edina, MN USA",Rush University; Twin Cities Orthopedics,"Chahla, J (corresponding author), Rush Univ, Midwest Orthopaed Rush, Med Ctr, 1611 West Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",jorge.chahla@rushortho.com,"gursoy, safa/KMA-3773-2024; LaPrade, Robert/AFA-8673-2022","LaPrade, Robert/0000-0002-9823-2306",,,,,25,1,2,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,2325-9671,,ORTHOP J SPORTS MED,Orthop.

Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces.Methods Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case.Results The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation.Conclusion This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces.","[Blanke, Fabian] Schon Klin Munchen Harlaching, Dept Knee Shoulder & Hip Surg & Orthoped Sports Me, Munich, Germany; [Blanke, Fabian; Lutter, Christoph; Tischer, Thomas] Univ Rostock, Dept Orthoped Surg, Rostock, Germany; [Boljen, Matthias] Fraunhofer Inst High Speed Dynam, Ernst Mach Inst, EMI, Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany; [Blanke, Fabian; Oehler, Nicola; Vogt, Stephan] Hessing Stiftung Augsburg, Dept Orthoped Sports Med & Arthroscop Surg, Augsburg, Germany",University of Rostock; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Blanke, F (corresponding author), Schon Klin Munchen Harlaching, Dept Knee Shoulder & Hip Surg & Orthoped Sports Me, Munich, Germany.;Blanke, F (corresponding author), Univ Rostock, Dept Orthoped Surg, Rostock, Germany.;Blanke, F (corresponding author), Hessing Stiftung Augsburg, Dept Orthoped Sports Med & Arthroscop Surg, Augsburg, Germany.",fblanke@gmx.de,"; Tischer, Thomas/H-4524-2019; Vogt, Stephan/AAQ-7434-2021","Boljen, Matthias/0000-0002-8728-8718; Tischer, Thomas/0000-0002-3942-0235;",Universittsmedizin Rostock (8980),Universittsmedizin Rostock (8980),Not applicable.,,36,5,6,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-8051,1434-3916,,ARCH ORTHOP TRAUM SU,Arch.

Although there has been concern for overconstraint of the lateral compartment of the knee with the ITB ACLR technique, rotational stability, as provided by the anterolateral ligament (ALL) and ACL, has not been assessed in the setting of pediatric ACLR techniques. Our hypothesis is that the ITB ACLR and AE ACLR with ALL reconstruction (ALLR) will best replicate the biomechanical profile of the intact ACL that is lost with transection of the ACL and ALL. Methods: Eight cadaveric legs were statically loaded with an anterior drawer force and varus, valgus, internal and external rotational moments at 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees of flexion. Displacement and rotation were recorded in the following conditions: intact ACL/intact ALL, ACL-deficient/intact ALL, ITB ACLR/intact ALL, ITB ACLR/ALL-deficient, ACL-deficient/ALL-deficient, AE ACLR/ALL-deficient, AE ACLR/ALLR. Results: Both ACLR techniques reduced anterior tibial translation from the ACL-deficient state, but neither restored it to the intact state (P<0.05), except in full extension. ALL deficiency increased anterior tibial translation in the ACL-deficient state (P<0.05). In rotational testing, no significant increase was seen with transection of the ACL, but the ACL-deficient/ALL-deficient state had a significant increase in internal rotation (P<0.05). This was significantly restored to the intact state at most flexion angles with the ITB ACLR without rotational overconstraint of the lateral compartment. The AE ACLR/ALL-deficient state and AE ACLR/ALLR improved rotational stability at lower flexion angles, but not at 60 and 90 degrees. There were no significant changes in varus/valgus moments. Conclusions: In this model, the ITB ACLR provided the superior biomechanical profile between our tested reconstructions. It best corrected both AP and rotatory stability without overconstraining the knee. The AE ACLR and AE ACLR/ALLR improved both parameters but not at all flexion angles and not as robustly. ACL deficiency in the knee increased anterior tibial translation, but did not affect rotatory stability. ALL deficiency in the knee increased anterior displacement and rotational moments in the ACL-deficient state.","[Trentacosta, Natasha; Mandelbaum, Bert] Santa Monica Orthopaed & Sports Med Grp, 2020 Santa Monica Blvd Suite 400, Santa Monica, CA 90404 USA; [Pace, James L.] Connecticut Childrens Med Ctr Hartford, Hartford, CT USA; [Trentacosta, Natasha; Metzger, Melodie; Michalski, Max; Nelson, Trevor; Polakof, Landon; Mandelbaum, Bert] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA",Connecticut Children's Medical Center; Cedars Sinai Medical Center,"Trentacosta, N (corresponding author), Santa Monica Orthopaed & Sports Med Grp, 2020 Santa Monica Blvd Suite 400, Santa Monica, CA 90404 USA.",natasha.trentacosta@cshs.org,"Metzger, Melodie/AAI-6142-2021","Metzger, Melodie/0000-0001-8892-7035",,,,,37,22,26,1,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0271-6798,1539-2570,,J PEDIATR ORTHOPED,J.

Methods Ninety-four consecutive patients (mean age 15.7 +/- 1.5 years) with at least 2 years of follow-up, who underwent ACL reconstruction with a single-bundle plus lateral-plasty hamstring technique in the same centre were included. Subsequent ACL injuries (ipsilateral ACL revision or contralateral ACL reconstruction) were assessed within the first 2 years after surgery. Anterior, central, posterior TPS of medial compartment were measured on lateral radiographs and compared between patients with intact graft and those with a second injury. Cut-off values with sensitivity and specificity were calculated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Survival analysis for second ACL injuries and multivariate analysis were performed. Results Eight patients (9%) had ipsilateral ACL Revision and eight patients (9%) had contralateral ACL reconstruction. Patients with contralateral injury had a higher Central TPS with respect to those without second injury (12.6 degrees +/- 2.8 degrees vs 9.3 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees,p = 0.042). No differences were present in patients with ipsilateral ACL revision. Sensitivity and specificity for central TPS slope >= 12 degrees to detect a contralateral rupture were 63% and 75% (p = 0.0092), for Anterior TPS were 100% and 52% (p = 0.0009). Patients with TPS values exceeding these cut-offs had higher rate of contralateral ACL injuries (19%vs4%,p = 0.0420) and lower 2-year survival (p = 0.0049). Multivariate analysis identified pre-operative sport level and TPS (either anterior or central) as risk factors for contralateral injuries. Conclusions Steep tibial plateau slope >= 12 degrees is associated with a higher risk of contralateral ACL injury within 2 years after ACL reconstruction in patients less than 18 years of age. However, TPS has no role in early ipsilateral re-injury after combined ACL reconstruction and lateral plasty. The clinical relevance is that both the surgeon and the patient should be aware of this higher risk and consider it in the rehabilitation phase to reduce the incidence of such injuries.","[Grassi, Alberto; Pizza, Nicola; Zambon Bertoja, Jacopo; Macchiarola, Luca; Lucidi, Gian Andrea; Dal Fabbro, Giacomo; Zaffagnini, Stefano] IRCCS Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Clin Ortoped & Traumatol 2, Via Pupilli 1, I-40136 Bologna, BO, Italy",,"Pizza, N (corresponding author), IRCCS Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Clin Ortoped & Traumatol 2, Via Pupilli 1, I-40136 Bologna, BO, Italy.",alberto.grassi@ior.it; nicola.pizza@ior.it; jacopo.zambon93@gmail.com; luca.macchiarola@hotmail.it; giandrea.lucidi@studio.unibo.it; giacomo.dalfabbro@studio.unibo.it; stefano.zaffagnini@unibo.it,"Lucidi, Gian Anea/IUP-1657-2023; Dal Fabbro, Giacomo/HLW-1179-2023; Grassi, Alberto/AAS-4364-2021; Macchiarola, Luca/AAC-5996-2020; Zaffagnini, Stefano/K-4499-2018","Lucidi, Gian Anea/0000-0003-3065-9212; Dal Fabbro, Giacomo/0000-0002-8258-6425; Grassi, Alberto/0000-0003-4236-1798; Macchiarola, Luca/0000-0002-2351-8836;",,,,,40,21,23,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0942-2056,1433-7347,,KNEE SURG SPORT TR A,Knee Surg.

The objective of this study is to report the results of a revision ACL reconstruction technique with a tibial tunnel performed from the anterolateral plateau associated with an anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction. Methods Patients with at least two ACL reconstructions that failed and who had significant enlargement and confluence of tunnels in the medial tibial plateau and underwent revision ACL reconstruction associated with ALL reconstruction with the tibial tunnel for the ACL performed from the lateral plateau between 2017 and 2019 were evaluated. All patients were evaluated by physical examination, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Lysholm functional scales. Results Six patients who underwent this surgical procedure were evaluated. All patients were sports practitioners and presented a grade 3 pivot shift. The mean age was 28.5 +/- 8.2 years, and the mean follow-up time was 34.1 +/- 12.8 months. No patient had a new graft rupture, but three (50%) had grade 1 pivot shift. Four patients had minor complications with no clinical impact on the final result. All except one patient were able to return to pre-injury type of sports, at a mean time of 14.6 +/- 2.3 months after surgery. Conclusion The anterolateral tibial tunnel technique using an Achilles tendon allograft for revision ACL reconstruction after multiple failures associated with an ALL reconstruction showed good results and no major complications. The anterolateral tunnel can be considered a good alternative in cases of medial tibial confluence or significant enlargement of the medial tunnels in re-revision procedures.","[Helito, Camilo Partezani; Moreira da Silva, Andre Giardino; Guimaraes, Tales Mollica; Sobrado, Marcel Faraco; Pecora, Jose Ricardo; Camanho, Gilberto Luis] Univ Sao Paulo, Hosp Clin HCFMUSP, Fac Med, Inst Ortopedia & Traumatol,Grp Joelho, Rua Dr Oviclio Pires de Campos 333, BR-05403010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Helito, Camilo Partezani; Sobrado, Marcel Faraco] Hosp Sirio Libanes, Rua Dona Adma Jafet 91, BR-01308050 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"da Silva, AGM (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Hosp Clin HCFMUSP, Fac Med, Inst Ortopedia & Traumatol,Grp Joelho, Rua Dr Oviclio Pires de Campos 333, BR-05403010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",andre.giardino1@gmail.com,"CAMANHO, GILBERTO/K-4011-2016; Partezani Helito, Camilo/X-3880-2019; P‚cora, Jos‚ Ricardo/HGD-1086-2022","P‚cora, Jos‚ Ricardo/0000-0003-1621-5252; Giardino, Ane/0000-0002-2358-7508",,,,,30,25,25,0,3,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2234-2451,,KNEE SURG RELAT RES,Knee Surg.

The risk for injury of the contralateral knee after ACL reconstruction could be nearly double that of ipsilateral graft rupture. Questions/Purposes We sought to identify independent, patient-related risk factors for contralateral ACL rupture following primary ACL reconstruction. Methods A national database was queried for patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction from 2007 to 2015 with a minimum of 2 years of post-operative follow-up (n = 12,044). Patients who underwent subsequent primary ACL reconstruction on the contralateral extremity were then identified. A multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis was utilized to evaluate patient-related risk factors for contralateral ACL rupture, including demographic and comorbidity variables. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each risk factor. Results Of the 3707 patients who had a minimum of 2 years of database activity and comprised the study group, 204 (5.5%) experienced a contralateral ACL rupture requiring reconstruction. Independent risk factors for contralateral ACL rupture included age less than 20 years, female gender, tobacco use, and depression. Obesity, morbid obesity, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and a history of anxiety were not significant predictors of contralateral injury. Conclusion We were able to adequately power an analysis to identify several significant patient-related risk factors for contralateral ACL rupture after primary ACL reconstruction, including younger age, female gender, tobacco use, and depression. This information can be used to counsel patients on the risk of injury to the contralateral knee.","[Cancienne, Jourdan M.; Browning, Robert] Midwest Orthoped Rush, 1611 Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Werner, Brian C.] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, POB 800159, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA",University of Virginia,"Werner, BC (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, POB 800159, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.",bcw4x@virginia.edu,,"Werner, Brian/0000-0002-7956-2123",,,,,24,11,12,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1556-3316,1556-3324,,HSS J,HSS J.,DEC,2020,16,2_SUPPL,,2_,,,226,229,,10.1007/s11420-019-09687-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11420-019-09687-x,,,4,Orthopedics; Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Orthopedics; Surgery,VK8DD,33380951,Green Submitted,,,2025-12-29,WOS:000755980400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: Fifty-six patients with ACL rupture were treated with ACL reconstruction. Among them, 28 patients were treated with PLT reconstruction (treatment group) and 28 patients were treated with HT reconstruction (control group). There were no significant differences in gender, age, injury side, course of disease, preoperative Lachman test, Lysholm score, IKDC score, joint mobility, MRI image between the two groups (P > 0.05). Result: The incision healed in the first stage after operation in both groups, and there were no significant neurovascular injuries and knee synovitis complications. Comparing the MRI of the two groups after operation, the effect of the treatment group was better than that of the control group. There were no complications in both groups. The Lysholm score and IKDC score of the treatment group were better than those of the control group at 6 and 12 months after operation (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in Lachman test between the two groups at 6 and 12 months after operation (P > 0.05). At 3 and 12 months after operation, the joint activity of the treatment group was better than that of the control group, with no significant difference (P > 0.05). The degree of tibial anterior displacement decreased significantly in both groups before and after operation (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Discussion: MRI scanning technology can significantly expand the scope of human body examination, improve the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of lesions. In traditional surgery, HT is often used as reconstruction material. However, there are many factors to be considered in the formulation of operation plan for double cruciate ligament injury, such as limb blood supply, accompanied by a variety of structural injuries, so the requirement for reconstruction is high. There was no significant difference in the recovery of knee stability between the two groups, but in terms of early recovery of knee function and subjective satisfaction of patients, the reconstruction of PLT was superior to that of HT. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging can effectively diagnose the curative effect, and it is worth popularizing and applying widely. Compared with HT, ACL reconstruction with PLT is easier to operate, and the early recovery of knee joint function and it is worth popularizing and applying widely.","[He, Ming; Sun, Xu; Fu, Yonghui] China Med Univ, Shengjing Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Shenyang 11000, Liaoning, Peoples R China",China Medical University,"Fu, YH (corresponding author), China Med Univ, Shengjing Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Shenyang 11000, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",,"sun, xu/JCN-6491-2023",,,,,,22,0,0,0,7,AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,VALENCIA,"26650 THE OLD RD, STE 208, VALENCIA, CA 91381-0751 USA",2156-7018,2156-7026,,J MED IMAG HEALTH IN,J.

This technique has some disadvantages: poor proprioception, donor site morbidity and the inability to restore joint kinematics. ACL repair could be an alternative treatment. The purpose of the study was to compare the stability and the function after ACL primary repair versus single-bundle ACLR. Methods: In a retrospective study, 12 patients underwent primary ACL repair with internal bracing, 15 patients underwent standard ACLR. Follow-up examinations were evaluated at up to 2 years postoperatively. One patient in the ACL repair group was lost to follow-up due to re-rupture. The absolute value of anterior tibial translation (ATT) and the side-to-side difference in the same patient (Delta ATT) were evaluated using the GNRB arthrometer. The Lysholm knee scoring was obtained. Re-ruptures and other complications were recorded. Results: Anterior tibial translation (ATT) was significantly decreased in the ACL repair group compared with the ACLR group (5.31 mm vs. 7.18 mm, respectively; p = 0.0137). Arthrometric measurements demonstrated a mean side-to-side difference (Delta ATT) 1.87 (range 0.2 to 4.9) mm significantly decreased compared to ACLR 3.36 (range 1.2-5.6 mm; p = 0.0107). The mean Lysholm score was 85.3 points in the ACL repair group and 89.9 in ACLR group. No significant differences between ACL repair and ACLR were found for the Lysholm score. There was no association between AP laxity and clinical outcomes. There were two complications in the internal bracing group: one patient had re-rupture and was treated by ACLR, another had limited extension and had arthroscopic debridement. Conclusions: Anterior tibial translation was significantly decreased after ACL repair. Additionally, the functional results after ACL repair with internal bracing were comparable with those after ACLR. It should be noted that the two complications occurred. The current study supports further development of ACL repair techniques.","[Szwedowski, Dawid] Orthopaed Arthroscop Surg Int OASI Biores Fdn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Paczesny, Lukasz; Zabrzynski, Jan] Orvit Clin, Dept Orthopaed, Citomed Healthcare Ctr, Sklodowskiej 73, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Zabrzynski, Jan] Univ Med Sci, Dept Gen Orthoped Musculoskeletal Oncol & Trauma, PL-61701 Poznan, Poland; [Gagat, Maciej] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Coll Med Bydgoszcz, Fac Med, Dept Histol & Embryol, PL-85067 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Domzalski, Marcin] Med Univ Lodz, Vet Mem Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, PL-90549 Lodz, Poland; [Huri, Gazi] Hacettepe Univ, Orthopaed & Traumatol Dept, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Widuchowski, Wojciech] Dist Hosp Orthoped & Trauma Surg, Dept Knee Surg Arthroscopy & Sports Traumatol, PL-41940 Piekary Slaskie, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum; Medical University Lodz; Hacettepe University,"Szwedowski, D (corresponding author), Orthopaed Arthroscop Surg Int OASI Biores Fdn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",dszwedow@yahoo.com; drpaczesny@gmail.com; zabrzynski@gmail.com; mgagat@cm.umk.pl; marcindomzalski@yahoo.com; gazihuri@yahoo.com; sportmed@sportmed.com.pl,"Gagat, Maciej/D-5356-2014; Szwedowski, Dawid/E-7188-2017; Zabrzynski, Jan/AAG-3295-2019; Domzalski, Marcin/M-3523-2016; huri, gazi/LIF-6022-2024","Gagat, Maciej/0000-0002-5445-8821; Szwedowski, Dawid/0000-0002-7027-0626; Zabrzynski, Jan/0000-0003-2714-2466; Domzalski, Marcin/0000-0003-1915-0773; Paczesny, Lukasz/0000-0002-1706-8090;",,,,,45,22,25,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to evaluate the association among radiological evidence of KF injury, intraoperative arthroscopic findings, and grade of pivot shift at the time of ACL reconstruction (ACLR). It was hypothesized that KF injury would be associated with increased injury to the lateral compartment of the knee and a higher grade of pivot shift. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis was conducted on 267 patients with ACL-injured knees who underwent primary ACLR. Patients who had MRI and surgery within 60 days of injury were included (mean age, 23.6 years); there were 158 (59.2%) male patients. MRI was performed using standard knee protocols, and diagnostic criteria were applied to identify KF injury. Associations were made among MRI findings, intraoperative findings, and grade of pivot shift with the patient examined under anesthesia at the time of ACLR. A comparison was made between patients with and without radiological evidence of KF injury. Results: The prevalence of KF injury was 17.6% (47/267 patients). Arthroscopic evidence of lateral meniscal injury was associated with KF injury (KF intact, 31%; KF injured, 55%; P = .010). The majority of patients in the intact and injured KF groups had a grade 2 pivot shift (75% and 70%, respectively). A minority had grade 3 pivot shift: 5% in the intact group versus 6.4% in the injured group. There was no association between radiological evidence of KF injury and pivot-shift grade (P = .600). Conclusion: In acute ACL injury, KF injuries were not very common (17.6%), and the rate of grade 3 pivot shift was low (5.2%). When present, KF injuries were not associated with a higher-grade pivot shift. However, there was an association between KF injury and lateral meniscal tears identified at the time of ACLR. The role of KFS in controlling anterolateral rotatory laxity in the acute ACL injury in the clinical setting may be less evident when compared with the biomechanical setting.","[Devitt, Brian M.; Al'khafaji, Ian; Blucher, Nicola; Batty, Lachlan M.; Murgier, Jerome; Webster, Kate E.; Feller, Julian A.] OrthoSport Victoria, 89 Bridge Rd, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia; [Devitt, Brian M.; Webster, Kate E.] La Trobe Univ, Sch Allied Hlth Human Serv & Sport, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University,"Devitt, BM (corresponding author), OrthoSport Victoria, 89 Bridge Rd, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia.",bdevitt@osv.com.au,,,,,,,43,16,18,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. In each knee, anatomical single-bundle ACL femoral tunnels were arthroscopically drilled at 120 and 140 degrees of flexion, and tunnels for popliteus tendon (PLT) and fibular collateral ligament (FCL) were drilled at 20A degrees axial/20A degrees coronal angulations and 10A degrees axial/30A degrees coronal angulations. Three-dimensional computed tomography exams of the knees were performed. The presence of tunnel collision was evaluated, and the minimal distance between tunnels and the LFC width was measured. Risk of tunnel collision was significantly increased if FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 10A degrees axial/30A degrees coronal angulation (P < 0.05). Tunnel collision was noted in only one knee when FCL and PLT tunnels were drilled at 20A degrees axial/20A degrees coronal angulations. Knees with smaller LFC width had significantly higher risk for tunnel collision (P < 0.05). Drilling PLT and FCL femoral tunnels at 20A degrees axial/20A degrees coronal angulation is a safe positioning for simultaneous ACL and PLC reconstructions. However, in smaller knees, the risk for tunnel collision could be greater. Surgeons should consider the possibility of tunnel collision when performing simultaneous ACL and PLC anatomical reconstruction, especially in knees with a small LFC width where the risk for tunnel collision could be greater.","[Gali, Julio Cesar; Bernardes, Adilio de Paula; dos Santos, Leonardo Cantarelli; Ferreira, Thiago Carrazone; Pires Almagro, Marco Antonio; Cintra da Silva, Phelipe Augusto] Catholic Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Rua Jouberte Wey 290, Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Gali, Julio Cesar; Bernardes, Adilio de Paula; dos Santos, Leonardo Cantarelli; Ferreira, Thiago Carrazone; Pires Almagro, Marco Antonio; Cintra da Silva, Phelipe Augusto] Unimed Hosp, Rua Jouberte Wey 290, Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Gali, Julio Cesar; Pires Almagro, Marco Antonio; Cintra da Silva, Phelipe Augusto] Unimed Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, R Antonia Dias Petri 135, Sorocaba, SP, Brazil; [Gali, Julio Cesar] R Caracas 418, BR-18046718 Sorocaba, SP, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo,"Gali, JC (corresponding author), R Caracas 418, BR-18046718 Sorocaba, SP, Brazil.",juliogali@globo.com,"; Gali, Julio Cesar/JZD-3055-2024","Gali, Julio/0000-0003-2369-6322; Cintra, Phelipe/0000-0002-5354-2925",,,,,27,19,20,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0942-2056,1433-7347,,KNEE SURG SPORT TR A,Knee Surg.

As accompanying osseous injuries of the ACL rupture a femoral impression the so-called lateral femoral notch sign and a posterolateral fracture of the tibial plateau are described. However, frequency, concomitant ligament injuries and when and how to treat these combined injuries are not clear. There is still a lack of understanding with which ligamentous concomitant injuries besides the anterior cruciate ligament injury these bony injuries are associated. Materials and methods One hundred fifteen MRI scans with proven anterior cruciate ligament rupture performed at our center were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of a meniscus, collateral ligament injury, a femoral impression, or a posterolateral impression fracture. Femoral impressions were described according to their local appearance and posterolateral tibial plateau fractures were described using the classification of Menzdorf et al. Results In 29 cases a significant impression in the lateral femoral condyle was detected. There was a significantly increased number of lateral meniscal (41.4% vs. 18.6% p = 0.023) and medial ligament (41.4% vs. 22.1%; p = 0.040) injuries in the group with a lateral femoral notch sign. 104 patients showed a posterolateral bone bruise or fracture of the tibial plateau. Seven of these required an intervention according to Menzdorf et al. In the group of anterior cruciate ligament injuries with posterolateral tibial plateau fracture significantly more lateral meniscus injuries were seen (p = 0.039). Conclusion In the preoperative planning of ACL rupture accompanied with a positive femoral notch sign, attention should be paid to possible medial collateral ligament and lateral meniscus injuries. As these are more likely to occur together. A posterolateral impression fracture of the tibial plateau is associated with an increased likelihood of the presence of a lateral meniscal injury. This must be considered in surgical therapy and planning and may be the indication for necessary early surgical treatment.","[Korthaus, Alexander; Krause, Matthias; Frosch, Karl-Heinz; Kolb, Jan Philipp] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Trauma & Orthopaed Surg, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Warncke, Malte] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Diagnost & Intervent Radiol & Nucl Med, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Pagenstert, Geert] Univ Basel, CLARAHOF Clin Orthopaed Surg, Clarahofweg 19a, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Frosch, Karl-Heinz] BG Hosp Hamburg, Dept Trauma Surg Orthopaed & Sports Traumatol, Bergedorfer Str 10, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Basel,"Frosch, KH (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Trauma & Orthopaed Surg, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.;Frosch, KH (corresponding author), BG Hosp Hamburg, Dept Trauma Surg Orthopaed & Sports Traumatol, Bergedorfer Str 10, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany.",unfallchirurgie@uke.de,"Korthaus, Alexander/GXA-2387-2022",,Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL(Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico),Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

A human knee model study,KNEE,,,English,Article,,,,,,ACL rupture; ALL; Rotatory instability; Knee model,MEDIAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT; CLINICAL-OUTCOMES; TEAM HANDBALL; RECONSTRUCTION; INSTABILITY; MANAGEMENT; TENODESIS; ROTATION; FAILURE; TENSION,"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction still has a risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Thus, extra-articular structures such as the anterolateral ligament (ALL) are increasingly treated. The ALL however prevents the internal rotation of the tibia and it must be doubted that the ALL protects the ACL in other common injury mechanisms which primarily include tibial external rotation. In this study we aimed to evaluate which extra-articular structures support the ACL in excessive tibial internal and external rotation using a knee finite element (FE) model. Methods: Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to an FE model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Three additional anatomic structures (anterolateral ligament, popliteal tendon and posterior oblique ligament) were added to the FE model separately and then all together. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. Results: The ACL was the most loaded ligament both in tibial internal and external rotation. The ALL was the main stabilizer of the tibial internal rotation (46%) and prevented the tibial external rotation by only 3%. High forces were only observed in the LCL with tibial external rotation. The ALL reduced the load on the ACL in tibial internal rotation by 21%, in tibial external rotation only by 2%. The POL reduced the load on the ACL by 8%, the PLT by 6% in tibial internal rotation. In tibial external rotation the POL and PLT did not reduce the load on the ACL by more than 1%. Conclusion: The ALL protects the ACL in injury mechanisms with tibial internal rotation but not in mechanisms with tibial external rotation. In injury mechanisms with tibial external rotation other structures that support the ACL need to be considered. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

New prevention programs can reduce the risk of ACL injuries. Surgical treatment is recommended for young and athletic patients as it can also reduce the risk of further relevant injuries of the meniscus and cartilage. The standard of surgical treatment in Germany is the ACL reconstruction with an autologous tendon graft. In selected cases, the preservation of the ACL by arthroscopic refixation shows good results.

It was hypothesized that rotatory knee laxity would increase with increasing injury grade, with knees with partial ACL tears demonstrating the lowest rotatory laxity and knees that had undergone failed ACL reconstruction demonstrating the highest rotatory laxity. Methods: A prospective multicenter study cohort of 354 patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction between 2012 and 2018 was examined. All patients had both injured and contralateral healthy knees evaluated using standardized, preoperative quantitative pivot shift testing, determined by a validated, image-based tablet software application and a surface-mounted accelerometer. Quantitative pivot shift was compared with the contralateral healthy knee in 20 patients with partial ACL tears, 257 patients with complete ACL tears, and 27 patients who had undergone a failed ACL reconstruction. Comparisons were made using 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc 2-sample t tests with Bonferroni correction. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: There were stepwise increases in side-to-side differences in quantitative pivot shift in terms of lateral knee compartment translation for patients with partial ACL tears (mean [and standard deviation], 1.4 +/- 1.5 mm), those with complete ACL tears (2.5 +/- 2.1 mm), and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (3.3 +/- 1.9 mm) (p = 0.01) and increases in terms of lateral compartment acceleration for patients with partial ACL tears (0.7 +/- 1.4 m/s(2)), those with complete ACL tears (2.3 +/- 3.1 m/s(2)), and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (2.4 +/- 5.5 m/s(2)) (p = 0.01). A significant difference in lateral knee compartment translation was found when comparing patients with partial ACL tears and those with complete ACL tears (1.2 +/- 2.1 mm [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2 to 2.1 mm]; p = 0.02) and patients with partial ACL tears and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (1.9 +/- 1.7 mm [95% CI, 0.8 to 2.9 mm]; p = 0.001), but not when comparing patients with complete ACL tears and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (0.8 +/- 2.1 [95% CI, -0.1 to 1.6 mm]; p = 0.09). Increased lateral compartment acceleration was found when comparing patients with partial ACL tears and those with complete ACL tears (1.5 +/- 3.0 m/s(2) [95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3 m/s(2)]; p = 0.0002), but not when comparing patients with complete ACL tears and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (0.1 +/- 3.4 m/s(2) [95% CI, -2.2 to 2.4 m/s(2)]; p = 0.93) or patients with partial ACL tears and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (1.7 +/- 4.2 m/s(2) [95% CI, -0.7 to 4.0 m/s(2)]; p = 0.16). An increasing lateral compartment translation of the contralateral, ACL-healthy knee was found in patients with partial ACL tears (0.8 mm), those with complete ACL tears (1.2 mm), and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction (1.7 mm) (p < 0.05). Conclusions: A progressive increase in rotatory knee laxity, defined by side-to-side differences in quantitative pivot shift, was observed in patients with partial ACL tears, those with complete ACL tears, and those who had undergone failed ACL reconstruction. These results may be helpful when assessing outcomes and considering indications for the management of high-grade rotatory knee laxity.","[Lian, Jayson; Diermeier, Theresa; Meghpara, Mitchell; Popchak, Adam; Smith, Clair N.; Musahl, Volker] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Lian, Jayson] Montefiore Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, New York, NY USA; [Diermeier, Theresa] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Orthopaed Sport Med, Munich, Germany; [Kuroda, Ryosuke] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Zaffagnini, Stefano] Ist Ortoped Rizzoli, Lab Biomeccan & Innovaz Tecnol, Bologna, Italy; [Samuelsson, Kristian; Karlsson, Jon] Gothenburg Univ, Sahlgrenska Univ Hosp, Sahlgrenska Acad, Dept Orthopaed, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Irrgang, James J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Phys Therapy, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Montefiore Medical Center; Technical University of Munich; Kobe University; IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli; University of Gothenburg; Sahlgrenska University Hospital; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Musahl, V (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",musahlv@upmc.edu,"; ZAFFAGNINI, STEFANO/K-4499-2018; Popchak, Adam/U-3938-2019; Musahl, Volker/HHD-1853-2022","Karlsson, Jon/0000-0002-6457-0817; ZAFFAGNINI, STEFANO/0000-0002-2941-1407; Sundemo, David/0000-0002-5871-1636; Samuelsson, Kristian/0000-0001-5383-3370; Irrgang, James/0000-0002-7529-2672; Popchak, Adam/0000-0002-4932-6541; Oostdyk, Alicia/0000-0003-4965-9298; Diermeier, Theresa/0000-0002-0549-5212;","International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine/Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation (ISAKOS/OREF) research grant [708661]","International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine/Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation (ISAKOS/OREF) research grant","This study was funded by an International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine/Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation (ISAKOS/OREF) research grant (No. 708661).

Methods: Between January 2010 and December 2013, 420 patients underwent ACL treatment. Forty-one patients were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: unilateral acute proximal ACL rupture, concomitant meniscus lesions, no previous knee ligament surgery, and no additional ligament injuries or absence of ligament injury of the contralateral knee. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirming a proximal avulsion tear of the ACL was required. Patients had to undergo surgical treatment within 6 weeks after injury. Follow-up examination included Lachman and pivot-shift testing, KT-1000 measurement, and the International Knee Documentation Committee score. Results: At a mean follow-up of 28 months (range, 24 to 31 month), 20 patients in each group were available. A mean KT-1000 arthrometer result of less than 3 mm indicated stability in all patients (P = .269). Three patients had a 1+ Lachman test (P = .072) and 4 patients had a 1+ pivot-shift test in the ACL repair group (P = .342). The International Knee Documentation Committee score results did not differ significantly (P > .99), but there was a significant correlation between poor results and failure rate (P = .001) in the refixation group. The failure rate was 15% in the ACL refixation group and 0% in the reconstruction group (P = .231). Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogeneous signal and proper ACL position in 100% of patients in the control group and 86% in the ACL repair group. Conclusions: Proximal refixation of the ACL using knotless suture anchors and microfracturing restores knee stability and results in comparable functional outcomes to a control group treated with single-bundle ACL reconstruction. The results suggest that refixation of the ACL is a feasible treatment option in selected patients.","[Achtnich, Andrea; Herbst, Elmar; Forkel, Philipp; Imhoff, Andreas B.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Orthopaed Sports Med, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Munich, Germany; [Metzlaff, Sebastian] St Joseph Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Trauma Surg, Berlin, Germany; [Sprenker, Frederike; Petersen, Wolf] Martin Luther Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Trauma Surg, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Achtnich, A (corresponding author), Klinikum Rechts Der Isar, Dept Orthopaed Sports Med, Ismaninger Str 22, D-81675 Munich, Germany.",a.achtnich@tum.de,"Imhoff, Andreas/E-8829-2013",,"International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery, and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine (ISAKOS); AGA; DGOU; DGOOC; Arthrex; Arthrosurface; Medi Bayreuth; Springer; Thieme; Karl Storz; Otto Bock; AAP Implantate","International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery, and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine (ISAKOS); AGA(American Gastroenterological Association); DGOU; DGOOC; Arthrex; Arthrosurface; Medi Bayreuth; Springer; Thieme; Karl Storz; Otto Bock; AAP Implantate","The authors report the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: A.B.I. receives support from International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery, and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine (ISAKOS); AGA; DGOU; DGOOC; Arthrex; Arthrosurface; Medi Bayreuth; Springer; and Thieme.

Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose was to evaluate the subjective and objective outcomes of combined reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee. The hypothesis was that favorable outcomes can be achieved with this surgical procedure compared with isolated anatomic reconstruction of the ACL. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: One hundred ten patients with a unilateral ACL injury and high-grade pivot shift were randomly assigned to undergo either combined ACL and ALL reconstruction (group A) or isolated ACL reconstruction (group B). Preoperative and postoperative evaluations of the patients were conducted by obtaining history details, recording physical examination findings, measuring knee laxity using the KT-1000 arthrometer, and using validated outcome scores for the knee. P < .05 was considered as the cut-off level of statistical significance. The Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess statistical significance. Results: At a mean follow-up of 27 months, 53 and 50 patients in groups A and B, respectively, were available for analysis. No statistically different outcomes were found between the 2 groups except for the KT-1000 arthrometer values. The median KT-1000 arthrometer result for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction was 1.3 mm, while the median result for isolated ACL reconstruction was 1.8 mm (P < .001). None of the patients (n = 0; 0.0%) who underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction had anterior translation of greater than 5 mm at maximum pulling strength compared with their normal knees at final follow-up. On the other hand, 3 (6.0%) patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstruction had anterior translation of more than 5 mm. No serious complications were found in both groups. Conclusion: Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction was found to be effective in improving subjective and objective outcomes. Nevertheless, these findings were not significantly superior to isolated ACL reconstruction except for the instrumented knee laxity testing results. This might indicate that ALL reconstruction should not be performed routinely for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction.","[Ibrahim, Samir Abdulrazik; Shohdy, Emad Mureed; Marwan, Yousef; Ramadan, Sami Abdulghaffar; Almisfer, Abdulrahman Khalid; Mohammad, Mohammad Wagdy; Abdulsattar, Wael Shoabe; Khirat, Shiref] Al Razi Orthopaed Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Div Sport Med, POB 24923, Kuwait 13110, Safat, Kuwait",,"Marwan, Y (corresponding author), Al Razi Orthopaed Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Div Sport Med, POB 24923, Kuwait 13110, Safat, Kuwait.",yousefmarwan@hotmail.com,,,,,,,36,102,112,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Results of a combined ACL and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction technique have never been reported. Purpose: To report subjective and objective outcomes after combined ACL and minimally invasive ALL reconstruction with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 92 patients underwent a combined ACL and ALL reconstruction. Indications for a combined procedure were associated Segond fracture, chronic ACL lesion, grade 3 pivot shift, high level of sporting activity, pivoting sports, and radiographic lateral femoral notch sign. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively with objective and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. Instrumented knee testing was performed with the Rolimeter arthrometer. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was obtained at the last follow-up. Complications including graft failure or contralateral ACL rupture were also recorded. Results: The mean follow-up time was 32.4 3.9 months. One patient (1.1%) was lost to follow-up, 1 patient (1.1%) suffered an ACL graft rupture, and 7 patients (7.6%) had a contralateral ACL rupture, leaving 83 patients for final evaluation. At the last follow-up, all patients had full range of motion. The Lysholm, subjective IKDC, and objective IKDC scores were significantly improved (all P < .0001). The Tegner activity scale at the last follow-up (7.1 +/- 1.8) was slightly lower than before surgery (7.3 +/- 1.7) (P < .01). The mean differential anterior laxity was 8 +/- 1.9 mm before surgery and significantly decreased to 0.7 +/- 0.8 mm at the last follow-up (P < .0001). Preoperatively, 41 patients had a grade 1 pivot shift, 23 had a grade 2, and 19 had a grade 3 according to the IKDC criteria. Postoperatively, 76 patients had a negative pivot shift (grade 0), and 7 patients were grade 1 (P < .0001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a combined reconstruction can be an effective procedure without specific complications at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Longer term and comparative follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether these combined reconstructions improve the results of ACL treatment.","[Sonnery-Cottet, Bertrand; Thaunat, Mathieu; Freychet, Benjamin; Pupim, Barbara H.

Twelve porcine knees were used in this study. Five fixation sequences were performed (angle indicating knee flexion): (a) PCL at 30A degrees and ACL at 30A degrees, (b) PCL at 90A degrees and ACL at 30A degrees, (c) ACL at 30A degrees and PCL at 30A degrees, (d) ACL at 30A degrees and PCL at 90A degrees, and (e) ACL and PCL simultaneous fixation at 30A degrees. Anterior and posterior tibial translation was measured under an 89 N load. A 3-D digitizer was used to measure the change in anteroposterior (AP) tibiofemoral position. None of the graft fixation sequences restored the AP laxity of the intact knee, and there are minimal differences in the in situ tissue forces in the ACL and PCL grafts. The reconstructions with fixation of the PCL graft first resulted in a significantly larger change in AP tibiofemoral position from the intact knee at 60A degrees and 90A degrees of knee flexion than the reconstructions with fixation of the ACL graft first (p < 0.05). Fixation of the ACL graft at 30A degrees of knee flexion followed by fixation of the PCL graft can best restore the tibiofemoral position of the intact knee.

Rotational instability confirmed by a positive pivot shift is present in more than 15% of cases who underwent successful ACL reconstruction. Persistent rotational instability interferes with performing pivoting sports, and also may lead to meniscal and chondral injuries, or re-rupture of the reconstructed ACL. Surgeons reconsidered the anatomy and biomechanics of the ACL and introduced the double bundle ACL reconstruction technique aiming to achieve a more rotational control by reconstructing the anteromedial and anterolateral bundles of the ACL. To date, the results of double bundle ACL reconstruction are mixed and inconsistent. The improved understanding of the existence, function, and biomechanical role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) in controlling the rotational instability of the knee has redirected and refocused attention on a supplemental extra-articular reconstruction of the ALL in conjunction with the intra-articular ACL reconstruction so as to restore normal kinematics of the knee. In this Technical Note, we describe a technique that allows for a combined ACL and double bundle ALL reconstruction using autogenous hamstring graft (semitendinosus and gracilis) tendons. This technique is an extension of our previously described technique of a combined anatomic ACL and single bundle ALL reconstruction. The improved understanding of the anatomy of the ALL makes a double bundle ALL reconstruction more anatomic than single bundle ALL reconstruction, as the native ALL is triangular or inverted Y in shape, with a narrow proximal femoral attachment and a broad distal tibial attachment between Gerdy's tubercle and the head of the fibula.","[Zein, Assem Mohamed Noureldin; Elshafie, Mohamed; Elsaid, Ahmed Nady Saleh; Elrefai, Mohamed Ahmed Elsaid] Menia Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Sports Injury Unit, Al Minya, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Minia University,"Zein, AMN (corresponding author), Minia Univ, 429 Adnan St,Cleopatra Ceram Bldg,5th Floor, El Minia 61111, Slovenia.",zein_asem@yahoo.com,"Saleh Elsaid, ahmed nady/JDD-5701-2023; Zein, Assem/GWR-2302-2022","Zein, Assem/0000-0001-5875-3783; Elsaid, Ahmed/0000-0003-3035-0784;",,,,,40,11,15,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-6287,,,ARTHROSC TEC,Arthrosc.

J,"Schoepp, C",,,,"Schoepp, Christian",,,Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. What is sure?,TRAUMA UND BERUFSKRANKHEIT,,,German,Article,,,,,,Cruciate ligament rupture; Transplant; Operation; Arthrosis; Fixation,,"The treatment of ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays an essential role for both clinicians and resident physicians. To date many questions regarding the outcome as well as ACL reconstruction techniques have not yet been conclusively clarified. Whether reconstruction of the ACL protects the knee from osteoarthritis is still unproven; however, it is well known that an unstable knee joint is more vulnerable to secondary injuries, such as meniscal tears. Thus, early ACL reconstruction is recommended to minimize the risk of these secondary injuries. Three alternative sources of material for autologous ACL reconstruction are commonly utilized. An accessory hamstring (i.e. semitendinosus tendon with or without the gracilis tendon), a central strip of the patellar tendon with bone blocks and a central strip of the quadriceps tendon with or without bone block are the most common donor tissues used in autografts. Besides selection of the type of graft, the tendon diameter also plays a crucial role. Some progress has recently been made with respect to tunnel placement. The aim is to find an anatomical tunnel position. Reconstruction of both the anteromedial and the posterolateral ACL bundles helps to rebuild the anatomy of the original ACL; however, scientifically this approach did not lead to any improvement in the results. For fixation techniques a differentiation is made between aperture, extracortical and implant-free fixation. Generally, reruptures are less common than revisions as a result of graft ruptures due to technical mistakes during surgery. The most common mistakes concern tunnel placement and graft fixation. Also overlooked instability can have a negative influence on the outcome of ACL reconstruction.","[Schoepp, Christian] BG Unfallklin Duisburg, Klin Arthroskop Chirurg Sporttraumatol & Sportmed, Grossenbaumer Allee 250, D-47249 Duisburg, Germany",,"Schoepp, C (corresponding author), BG Unfallklin Duisburg, Klin Arthroskop Chirurg Sporttraumatol & Sportmed, Grossenbaumer Allee 250, D-47249 Duisburg, Germany.",Christian.schoepp@bgu-duisburg.de,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1436-6274,,,TRAUMA BERUFSKRANKH,Trauma Berufskrankh.,FEB,2016,18,,,1,,,S33,S38,,10.1007/s10039-015-0099-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10039-015-0099-0,,,6,Emergency Medicine,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Emergency Medicine,VE0VU,,Bronze,,,2025-12-29,WOS:000438383500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Satisfactory results have been reported so far in the younger age group. Dilemma arises regarding the suitability of ACL reconstruction in the patients aged 50 years and above. This retrospective analyses the outcome of ACL reconstruction in patients aged 50 years and above at the time of presentation. Materials and Methods: 55 patients aged 50 years and above presented to our institution with symptomatic ACL tear and were managed with arthroscopic reconstruction with patellar tendon/hamstring graft. 22 patients underwent ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and the remaining 33 with a hamstring graft. Evaluation of functional outcome was performed using International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scoring in the preoperative period, at the end of 1 year and at the final followup. Radiographic evaluation was performed using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system. Results: The mean preoperative IKDC score was 39.7 +/- 3.3. At the end of 1-year following the operation, the mean IKDC score was 73.6 +/- 4.9 and at the final followup was 67.8 +/- 7.7. The mean preoperative Lysholm score was 40.4 +/- 10.3. At the end of 1-year following the intervention, the mean Lysholm score was 89.7 +/- 2.1 and at final followup was 85.3 +/- 2.5. Overall, 14 out of 42 patients who underwent radiographic assessment showed progression of osteoarthritis changes at the final followup after the intervention. Conclusion: In our study, there was a statistically significant improvement in the IKDC and Lysholm scores following the intervention. There was a slight deterioration in the scores at the final followup but the overall rate of satisfaction was still high and most of the patients were able to do their routine chores and light exercises suitable for their age group. Around one-third of patients show progression of radiographic changes in the postoperative period and this requires long term evaluation.","[Bali, Tarun; Nagraj, Raghu; Kumar, Malhar N.; Chandy, Thomas] HOSMAT Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Bengaluru 560025, Karnataka, India",,"Bali, T (corresponding author), HOSMAT Hosp, 45 Magrath Rd,Richmond Rd, Bengaluru 560025, Karnataka, India.",drtarunbali8@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,5,7,0,5,MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS & MEDIA PVT LTD,MUMBAI,"B-9, KANARA BUSINESS CENTRE, OFF LINK RD, GHAKTOPAR-E, MUMBAI, 400075, INDIA",0019-5413,1998-3727,,INDIAN J ORTHOP,Indian J.

Few studies have directly compared the biomechanical laxity of anatomic single-bundle (SB) versus anatomic double-bundle (DB) ACL reconstruction techniques based on precise anatomic descriptions. Hypothesis: Anatomic tunnel positioning for SB and DB reconstructions would produce comparable anterior-posterior and rotatory knee laxity. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Nine matched pairs of cadaveric knees were evaluated for the kinematics of intact, ACL-deficient, and either anatomic SB or anatomic DB ACL-reconstructed knees. Reconstruction tunnels were placed either centrally in the ACL footprint or within the AM and PL footprints. A 6 degrees of freedom robotic system was used to assess knee laxity with an 88-N anterior tibial load and a simulated pivot-shift test of combined 10-N.m valgus and 5-N.m internal tibial torques. Rotational motion was measured with internal and external torques of 5 N.m along with varus and valgus torques of 10 N.m. One-sample and 2-sample independent t tests were used to compare between groups (P < . 05). Results: No significant differences were found between anatomic SB and DB reconstruction groups during anterior tibial loading. Anterior tibial translations during simulated pivot shift had no significant differences between anatomic reconstruction groups. Tibial rotation for internal/external and varus/valgus torques showed no significant differences between anatomic reconstructions, with the exception of small (<3 degrees) but statistically significant differences in internal rotation at 20 degrees and 30 degrees of flexion. Despite the similar behavior between the 2 anatomic reconstruction groups, neither technique was able to reproduce the intact state during an anterior tibial load. Conclusion: No significant differences in anterior translation were found between the anatomic SB and anatomic DB ACL reconstructions for simulated pivot shift or anterior tibial loading.","[Goldsmith, Mary T.; Jansson, Kyle S.; Smith, Sean D.; Engebretsen, Lars; LaPrade, Robert F.; Wijdicks, Coen A.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Dept BioMed Engn, Vail, CO 81657 USA",Steadman Philippon Research Institute,"Wijdicks, CA (corresponding author), Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Dept BioMed Engn, 181 Meadow Dr,Suite 1000, Vail, CO 81657 USA.",cwijdicks@sprivail.org,"Wijdicks, Coen/M-7544-2019; LaPrade, Robert/AFA-8673-2022","Wijdicks, Coen/0000-0003-1831-6161; LaPrade, Robert/0000-0002-9823-2306",Health East Norway Grant [10703604],Health East Norway Grant,Drs LaPrade and Engebretsen are consultants for Arthrex Inc.

Meniscal root tears further increase these risks. This study reports the first documented case of simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and dual meniscal root injuries, emphasizing the unique surgical and rehabilitative challenges involved. Presentation of case: A 19-year-old male presented with persistent knee pain and instability seven months after a traumatic injury from a major fall. Examination revealed a range of motion of 0-120 degrees, no swelling or tenderness, but a positive recurvatum over 10 degrees, indicating significant instability. Lachman's, McMurray's, pivot shift, and both anterior and posterior drawer tests were positive. Discussion: The radiography of the right knee revealed no fractures. The MRI confirmed injuries to the ACL, PCL, and the posterior roots of both the lateral and medial menisci. The patient received surgical intervention. Grafts were obtained: the peroneus longus tendon autograft for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and a hamstring autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The ACL and PCL reconstructions were subsequently performed utilizing an all-inside technique, and both posterior roots of the lateral and medial menisci were repaired. Postoperative care included knee immobilization and a progressive rehabilitation program. Conclusion: Effective management of multiple ligament knee injuries necessitates a comprehensive approach, including precise identification and treatment of all torn ligaments, accurate graft placement, and robust fixation. Simultaneous reconstruction reduces hospital stays, anaesthesia exposure, and surgical risks while streamlining rehabilitation, enabling quicker patient recovery and improved outcomes.","[Adi, Mohamed Muath; Mohamed, Ahmed Mohamed Yousif; Abdulgadir, Mohanad; Meda, Muhammad Rafat; Mohamed, Nujud AbdelMoneim Sayed; Alkhyeli, Jaber] Burjeel Med City, Orthoped Dept, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,"Mohamed, AMY (corresponding author), Burjeel Med City, Orthoped Dept, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",Ahmedtom11@hotmail.com,,"AlKhyeli, Jaber/0000-0001-9950-4353",,,,,34,0,1,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",2210-2612,,,INT J SURG CASE REP,Int.

Acute and chronic functional instability with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament giving way phenomena, acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament with concomitant meniscus repair. Local infection in the knee joint, local soft tissue damage, lack of cooperation of the patient. The operation begins with the examination under anesthesia. It follows an arthroscopic examination of the knee and the arthroscopic treatment of accompanying intra-articular lesions (meniscus and cartilage damage). The semitendinosus tendon is harvested via a 3 cm skin incision medial to the tibial tuberosity. A four stranded tendon graft is prepared with a minimum length of 6.5 cm. Alternetive grafts for this technique are the patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, and allografts. The femoral tunnel for the ACL graft is drilled via a deep anteromedial portal under arthroscopic control. For precise placement of the guide wire a specific offset aimer is used. For drilling the knee must be flexed more than 110A degrees. Landmarks are the intercondylar line and the cartilage-bone interface. The position of the guide wire is always controlled by the medial portal (medial portal view). The guide wire is overdrilled with a cannulated drill (4.5 mm when a flip tack is used). The drill diameter for the 30 mm long blind tunnel is choosen according to the graft diameter. A gentle tunnel preparation may be achieved with the use of dilators. At the tibia, the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus is used as a landmark in the absence of ACL stump. The guide wire is first overdrilled with a 6 mm drill. Slight adjustments to the tibial tunnel location can be archieved when the guide wire is overdrilled eccentrically with a larger drill. At the femur an extrakortikal fixation technique with a flip button is preferred. At the tibia, a hybrid fixation with absorbable interference screw and button is used. The rehabilitation program is divided into three phases. During the inflammatory phase (1st-2nd week) control of pain and swelling is recommended. The patient is lmobilized with 20 kg partial weigth bearing. During the proliferative phase (3nd-6th week), load and mobility are slowly increased. Goal of this phase is it full extension. Exercises should be performed in a closed chain. During the remodeling phase strength and coordination exercises can be started. Athletes should not return to competitive sports before the 6th to 8th month. In a prospective study, we have examined 21 patients treated with an anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in single-bundle technique, after two years. As graft the semitendinosus was used. The postoperative MRI diagnosis showed that all tunnels were positioned anatomically. KT 1000 measurement showed that the difference of anterior translation decreased from an average of 6.4-1.7 mm. A sliding pivot shift phenomenon was detected in only one patient. The postoperative Lysholmscore was 94.2 points.","[Petersen, W.; Forkel, P.; Achtnich, A.; Metzlaff, S.] Martin Luther Krankenhaus, Klin Orthopadie & Unfallchirurg, D-14193 Berlin, Germany; [Zantop, T.] Sporthopaedicum Straubing, Straubing, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Petersen, W (corresponding author), Martin Luther Krankenhaus, Klin Orthopadie & Unfallchirurg, Berlin Grunewald Caspar Theyss Str 27-31, D-14193 Berlin, Germany.",w.petersen@mlk-berlin.de,,,,,,,20,35,47,0,20,URBAN & VOGEL,MUNICH,"NEUMARKTER STRASSE 43, D-81673 MUNICH, GERMANY",0934-6694,,,OPER ORTHOP TRAUMATO,Oper.

However, biomechanical studies have demonstrated that conventional single-bundle ACL reconstruction techniques are only successful in limiting anterior tibial translation but less effective for restoring rotatory laxity. Purpose: This study aimed to compare the results of single-and double-bundle ACL reconstruction using an anatomic technique, individualized based on the patient's native ACL size. The authors hypothesized that there would be no difference between the results of anatomic single-bundle (ASB) and anatomic double-bundle (ADB) reconstruction when the surgical technique is individualized. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Depending on intraoperative measurements of the ACL insertion site size, patients were selected for either ASB (n = 32) or ADB (n = 69) ACL reconstruction. In all groups, hamstring tendons autograft was used with suspensory fixation on the femoral side and bioabsorbable interference screw fixation on the tibial side. The outcomes were evaluated by an independent blinded observer using the Lysholm score, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, KT-1000 arthrometer for anteroposterior stability, and pivot-shift test for rotational stability. The average follow-up was 30 months (range, 26-34 months). There were no statistically significant differences in the baseline demographics of the 2 groups. Results: There was no significant difference between the ADB and ASB groups for Lysholm score (93.9 vs 93.5), subjective IKDC score (93.3 vs 93.1), anterior tibial translation (1.5- vs 1.6-mm side-to-side difference), and pivot shift (92% vs 90% with negative pivot-shift examination).

This is often the result of unrecognized injury to the secondary stabilizers of the knee. The anatomic double-bundle ACL surgery has been shown to more accurately recreate the kinematics of the native knee in comparison with classic transtibial single-bundle ACL reconstructions.

Symptomatic anterior instability impairs knee function and can lead to arthrosis, the onset of which can be slowed down by ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon graft. With regard to postoperative onset of arthrosis, the extent of initial accompanying injuries is also relevant. Anatomic techniques should be used for surgical procedures. The patellar and semitendinous tendons are suited to autologous hamstring grafts. With the latter, both ACL bundles can be replaced sep-arately (double-bundle technique), which has been shown in biomechanical tests and clinical studies to provide better stability compared with the single-bundle technique.

On further inspection, and when the tibia was reduced, the normal appearance of the ACL returned, with visualization of the AMB obscuring the PLB. We have named this arthroscopic finding the PLB sign. This finding confirms the individual roles of each bundle of the ACL. It is important to not misinterpret this abnormal appearance of the ACL as a partial ACL tear in a PCL-deficient knee.","Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Ctr Sports Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Fu, FH (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Ctr Sports Med, Kaufmann Bldg,Suite 1011,3471 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",ffu@upmc.edu,,"Feng, Matthew/0000-0003-0862-9877",,,,,0,2,2,0,0,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0749-8063,1526-3231,,ARTHROSCOPY,Arthroscopy,OCT,2005,21,10,,,,,1267,1267,,10.1016/j.arthro.2005.07.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2005.07.009,,,1,Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,978XZ,16226658,,,,2025-12-29,WOS:000232907700018,View Full Record in Web of Science

This finding is supported by laboratory studies that have demonstrated that combined ACL reconstruction and lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedures protect the ACL graft by load-sharing with it and by more reliably restoring normal knee kinematics compared with isolated ACL reconstruction. Description: The ACL graft is formed from a tripled semitendinosus tendon and a single strand of gracilis tendon. The femoral tunnel is drilled to provide an anatomic location intra-articularly and to exit the femur just posterior and proximal to the lateral epicondyle. The additional length of gracilis therefore exits the femoral tunnel at the anatomic origin of the ALL and is then routed (under the iliotibial band [ITB]) through a tibial tunnel, and back to the femoral origin, to reconstruct the ALL. Alternatives: Many different types of nonanatomic lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedures have been reported. The most frequently performed were the Lemaire and MacIntosh procedures; however, these, and others, were widely abandoned after poor results were reported in the 1980s. Rationale: ALL reconstruction differs from other lateral extra-articular tenodesis-type procedures because the procedure is anatomically based and can be percutaneously performed. Nonanatomic procedures (typically with a strand of ITB passed under the lateral collateral ligament [LCL]) have been reported to be associated with overconstraint, early arthritis, and an increased risk of infection(2-5). In contrast, ALL reconstruction has been shown to restore normal knee kinematics and to avoid overconstraint when correctly fixed in full extension and neutral rotation(6). The main concern with any type of lateral extra-articular tenodesis is based on historical reports of poor outcomes(2,3). However, a recent study has demonstrated that combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is associated with a reoperation rate that is comparable with the rate seen after isolated ACL reconstruction, and it has a very low rate of complications(7). This makes a compelling argument for anatomic ALL and ACL reconstruction being the procedure of choice when considering an extra-articular procedure. This is further supported by the fact that, even though previous studies have demonstrated a trend toward reduced ACL graft rupture with nonanatomic lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedures, they have not shown a significant improvement in outcomes(8). Combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is currently the only type of lateral extra-articular procedure that has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of ACL graft rupture and improve the rate of return to sports(1).","[Saithna, Adnan] Nottingham Trent Univ, Med Technol & Adv Mat, Clifton Campus, Nottingham, England; [Saithna, Adnan] Renacres Hosp, Ormskirk, England; [Thaunat, Mathieu; Delaloye, Jean Romain; Ouanezar, Herve; Fayard, Jean Marie; Sonnery-Cottet, Bertrand] Hop Prive Jean Mermoz, Dept Orthopaed Surg & Sports Med, FIFA Med Ctr Excellence, Ctr Orthoped Santy,Grp Ramsay Gen Sante, Lyon, France",Nottingham Trent University,"Sonnery-Cottet, B (corresponding author), Hop Prive Jean Mermoz, Dept Orthopaed Surg & Sports Med, FIFA Med Ctr Excellence, Ctr Orthoped Santy,Grp Ramsay Gen Sante, Lyon, France.",sonnerycottet@aol.com,"; Saithna, Adnan/D-5105-2015","Sonnery-Cottet, Bertrand/0000-0002-6837-0425; Saithna, Adnan/0000-0002-2408-5307",,,,,11,66,79,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",2160-2204,,,JBJS ESSENT SURG TEC,JBJS Essent.

However, current therapies primarily focus on symptom management, and their ability to effectively decelerate disease progression remains limited. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) in attenuating chondrocyte ferroptosis to delay OA progression. Methods: Plt-exos were isolated from human apheresis platelets and then characterized. The protective effects of Plt-exos on chondrocytes against IL-1 beta-induced ferroptosis were assessed through the detection of intracellular ferroptosis hallmarks and the expression levels of genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism and ferroptosis regulation in SW1353 cells. Key miRNAs in Plt-exos were identified, with miR-25-3p's role in chondrocyte ferroptosis and its interaction with P53 further investigated. Finally, the effect of Plt-exos-derived miR-25-3p on OA was validated in anterior cruciate ligament transection mice. Results: Plt-exos significantly reduced reactive oxygen species, Fe2+ and malonaldehyde levels, and down-regulated ferroptosis drivers (P53, ALOX12), while enhancing glutathione and ferroptosis suppressors (SLC7A11, GPX4). Moreover, Plt-exos maintained ECM homeostasis by restoring COL2 and MMP13 expression. Notably, miR-25-3p was identified as a crucial mediator of these protective effects, as its inhibition reversed the benefits conferred by Plt-exos on ferroptosis. Furthermore, miR-25-3p directly targets the 3' UTR of P53, thereby suppressing its expression. In vivo studies revealed that Plt-exos administration improved cartilage preservation and subchondral bone remodeling in OA mice, with these effects being attenuated upon co-administration of anta-gomir-25-3p. Conclusion: Plt-exos effectively delay OA progression in vitro and in vivo though attenuating chondrocyte ferroptosis by targeting the miR-25-3p/P53 axis. Plt-exos may serve as innovative nanotherapeutics for OA management, offering significant prospects for clinical application.","[Xu, Chenyue; Ni, Zhengyi; Chen, Xiaobo; Dong, Zhenyue; Kang, Huijun; Wang, Fei] Hebei Med Univ, Dept Joint Surg, Hosp 3, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chenyue; Ni, Zhengyi; Shi, Yuhang; Chen, Xiaobo; Dong, Zhenyue; Kang, Huijun; Wang, Fei] Hebei Prov Sino US Int Joint Res Ctr Bone & Joint, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chenyue; Ni, Zhengyi; Shi, Yuhang; Chen, Xiaobo; Dong, Zhenyue; Kang, Huijun; Wang, Fei] Hebei Prov Joint Degenerat & Sports Injury Technol, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yuhang; Zhao, Ziang] Hebei Med Univ, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Mi, Ziyue] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Hematol, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Mi, Ziyue; Chen, Wei] Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Inst Blood Transfus, Clin Transfus Res Ctr, Chengdu 610052, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Hebei Medical University; Hebei Medical University; Sichuan University; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Blood Transfusion - CAMS; Peking Union Medical College,"Dong, ZY; Kang, HJ; Wang, F (corresponding author), Hebei Med Univ, Dept Joint Surg, Hosp 3, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China.;Dong, ZY; Kang, HJ; Wang, F (corresponding author), Hebei Prov Sino US Int Joint Res Ctr Bone & Joint, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China.;Dong, ZY; Kang, HJ; Wang, F (corresponding author), Hebei Prov Joint Degenerat & Sports Injury Technol, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China.",dongzhenyue@hebmu.edu.cn; kanghuijun@hebmu.edu.cn; wangfei@hebmu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81873983]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [H2022206534, H2021206162]; Science and Technology Support Program of Hebei [252W7710D]; Graduate Innovation Project of Hebei Province [CXZZBS2024128]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Medical University [YBKJ202503]; Medical Science Research Project of Hebei Province [20240462]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei ProvinceInstituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico); Science and Technology Support Program of Hebei; Graduate Innovation Project of Hebei Province; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Medical University; Medical Science Research Project of Hebei Province,"Our work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81873983) , Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (H2022206534, H2021206162) , Science and Technology Support Program of Hebei (252W7710D) , Graduate Innovation Project of Hebei Province (CXZZBS2024128) , Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Medical University for Outstanding Doctoral Student (YBKJ202503) and Medical Science Research Project of Hebei Province (20240462) .",,63,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

Recently, the role of the anterolat-eral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concur-rent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstruct-ed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values. QT and PLT grafts are valuable alternatives for currently used grafts in combined ACL and ALL reconstructive procedures. This new technique is a reasonable option in ACL revision surgery and a good alternative in primary ACL and ALL reconstruction, especially when hamstring grafts are not advised or they are missing.","[Josipovic, Mario; Serdar, Jure; Levaj, Ivan; Jelic, Mislav] Univ Hosp Ctr Zagreb, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Zagreb, Croatia; [Josipovic, Mario; Vlaic, Josip; Jelic, Mislav] Univ Zagreb, Sch Med, Zagreb, Croatia; [Vlaic, Josip] Childrens Hosp Zagreb, Div Paediat Orthopaed Surg, Zagreb, Croatia; [Simunovic, Marko] Univ Zagreb, Sch Med, Univ Hosp Ctr Zagreb, Dept Radiol, Zagreb, Croatia; [Nizic, Dinko] Special Hosp Pulm Dis, Dept Radiol & Ultrasound Diagnost, Zagreb, Croatia; [Jelic, Mislav] Univ Zagreb, Univ Hosp Ctr Zagreb, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Salata 6-7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb Hospital; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb Hospital; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb Hospital; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb Hospital,"Jelic, M (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Univ Hosp Ctr Zagreb, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Salata 6-7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mislavorto@gmail.com,"Nizi?, Dinko/M-5586-2019; Josipovi?, Mario/HNC-2960-2023",,,,,,25,1,1,0,3,SESTRE MILOSRDNICE UNIV HOSPITAL,ZAGREB,"VINOGRADSKA C 29, ZAGREB, HR-10000, CROATIA",0353-9466,1333-9451,,ACTA CLIN CROAT,Acta Clin.

All were tested in 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees C flexion. Anterior-posterior stability was measured with a rolimeter. Rotation with a torque of 8.85Nm was measured photographically. The ALL was well defined in 78% of knees. ACL reconstruction had a significant effect on anterior-posterior stability. Detaching the ALL had a significant effect on internal rotatory stability and on anterior-posterior stability in ACL-insufficient knees. Reconstruction of ACL and ALL reestablished knee stability. The appearance of the ALL was not uniform. The ALL was an internal rotational stabilizer. Anatomical ALL reconstruction in combination with ACL reconstruction could reestablish stability. ALL reconstruction might be considered in patients with combined ACL and ALL tears, but the clinical effect should be established in a controlled clinical study.","[Tavlo, M.; Jensen, J.

However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. Purpose: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1 & beta; stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Results: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo.","[Xu, Chenyue; Dong, Zhenyue; Chen, Xiaobo; Ji, Gang; Kang, Huijun; Li, Kehan; Wang, Fei] Hebei Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 3, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei] Hebei Med Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Affiliated Hosp 3, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Bo] Hebei Med Univ, Teaching Expt Ctr, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Mi, Ziyue] Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Inst Blood Transfus, Clin Transfus Res Ctr, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Bo] Hebei Med Univ, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China",Hebei Medical University; Hebei Medical University; Hebei Medical University; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Blood Transfusion - CAMS; Hebei Medical University,"Wang, F (corresponding author), Hebei Med Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Affiliated Hosp 3, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China.;Zhao, B (corresponding author), Hebei Med Univ, Teaching Expt Ctr, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China.",doctorwfei@163.com; zhaobo686@163.com,"Xu, Chenyue/HPF-8418-2023; Botian, Zhao/ACY-8770-2022; Mi, Ziyue/GWZ-6629-2022","Xu, Chenyue/0000-0002-8484-3181; Wang, Fei/0000-0002-4812-9394",National Natural Science Foundation of China [81873983]; Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [H2019206694],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 81873983) and Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (grant No. H2019206694).

Understanding the anatomy and function of the ACL plays a key role in management of patients with ACL injury. Anatomic ACL reconstruction aims to restore the function of the native ACL. Femoral and tibial tunnels should be placed in their anatomical location accounting for both the native ACL insertion site and bony landmarks. One main component of anatomical individualized ACL reconstruction is customizing the treatment according to each patient's individual characteristics, considering preoperative and intraoperative evaluation of the native ACL and knee bony anatomy. Anatomical individualized reconstruction surgery should also aim to restore the size of the native ACL insertion as well.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ACL reconstruction and extra-articular reconstruction on joint motion in the ACL-deficient knee and in the combined ACL and anterolateral capsule-deficient knee. Methods: An anterior tibial load of 134 N and internal tibial torque of 7 Nm were applied to 7 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees using a robotic testing system continuously throughout the range of flexion. The resulting joint motion was recorded for 6 knee states: intact, ACL-deficient, ACL-reconstructed, combined ACL and anterolateral capsule-deficient, ACL-reconstructed 1 anterolateral capsule-deficient, and ACL-reconstructed 1 extra-articular tenodesis. Results: Anterior tibial translation of the ACL-reconstructed 1 anterolateral capsule-deficient knee in response to an anterior tibial load was restored to that of the intact knee at all knee-flexion angles (p > 0.05). However, for this knee state, internal tibial rotation in response to internal tibial torque was not restored to that of the intact knee at 60 degrees or 90 degrees of knee flexion (p < 0.05). For the knee state of ACL-reconstructed 1 extra-articular tenodesis, internal rotation in response to internal tibial torque was restored to the motion of the intact knee at each of the tested knee-flexion angles (p > 0.05). Compared with the intact knee, 2 of 7 specimens showed decreased internal tibial rotation with ACL reconstruction 1 extra-articular tenodesis. Conclusions: In this study, an extra-articular tenodesis was necessary to restore rotatory knee stability in response to internal tibial torque in a combined ACL and anterolateral capsule-deficient knee. The amount of rotatory knee instability should be carefully assessed to avoid over-constraint of the knee in these combined ligament-reconstruction procedures.","[Guenther, Daniel; Irarrazaval, Sebastian; Bell, Kevin M.; Rahnemai-Azar, Amir Ata; Fu, Freddie H.; Debski, Richard E.; Musahl, Volker] Univ Pittsburgh, Orthopaed Robot Lab, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Guenther, Daniel; Irarrazaval, Sebastian; Rahnemai-Azar, Amir Ata; Fu, Freddie H.; Musahl, Volker] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Bell, Kevin M.; Debski, Richard E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Bioengn, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Guenther, Daniel] Hannover Med Sch MHH, Trauma Dept, Hannover, Germany",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Hannover Medical School,"Musahl, V (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Orthopaed Robot Lab, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.;Musahl, V (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",musahlv@upmc.edu,"Musahl, Volker/HHD-1853-2022; Bell, Kevin/MGU-4977-2025; Irarr zaval, Sebasti n/AAM-5920-2020; Guenther, Daniel/I-6686-2019","Irarr zaval, Sebasti n/0000-0002-1215-1709; Guenther, Daniel/0000-0002-3397-5643",Pittsburgh Foundation; University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,Pittsburgh Foundation; University of Pittsburgh Medical Center(University of Pittsburgh),"The generous support of the Albert B.

Sixty-four ACL-injured patients from three sites underwent bilateral 3T MR T-1 and T-2 mapping; 56 patients returned 6 months after surgery. Cross-sectional and longitudinal VBR comparisons of relaxation times were calculated. Noyes Score (NS) clinical grades of cartilage lesions were noted at both times and correlated with relaxation times. Lastly, patients were divided into two groups based on baseline NS grades in the injured knee. T-1 times of each group were assessed with VBR and compared. Results illustrate the feasibility of VBR for efficiently analyzing data from patients at different sites. Significant relaxation time elevations at baseline were observed in the injured knee compared to the uninjured, particularly in the posterolateral tibia (pLT). Longitudinally, a decrease was observed in the pLT and patella, while an increase was noted in the trochlea. Stratifying patients by baseline lesion presence revealed T-1 increased more 6 months after surgery in patients with lesions. Such findings propose that the presence of cartilage lesions at baseline are associated with the longitudinal progression of T-1 and T-2 after ACL injury, and may contribute to early cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, the speed and localized specificity of automatic VBR analysis may translate well for clinical application, as seen in this multicenter study. (c) 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

However, the ability to fully restore rotational stability with ACL reconstruction (ACLR) remains a challenge, as evidenced by the persistence of rotational instability in up to 25% of patients after surgery. Advocacy for reconstruction of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) is rapidly increasing because some biomechanical studies have reported that the ALL is a significant contributor to internal rotational stability of the knee. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of ALL reconstruction (ALLR) graft fixation angle on knee joint kinematics in the clinically relevant setting of a concomitant ACLR and to determine the optimal ALLR graft fixation angle. It was hypothesized that all fixation angles would significantly reduce rotational laxity compared with the sectioned ALL state. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten nonpaired fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees underwent a full kinematic assessment in each of the following states: (1) intact; (2) anatomic single-bundle (SB) ACLR with intact ALL; (3) anatomic SB ACLR with sectioned ALL; (4) anatomic SB ACLR with 7 anatomic ALLR states using graft fixation angles of 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees; and (5) sectioned ACL and ALL. Internal rotation during a 5-Nm internal rotation torque and anterior translation during an 88-N anterior load were recorded at 15 degrees flexion intervals between 0 degrees and 120 degrees. Axial plane translation and internal rotation during a simulated pivot-shift test (combined 5-Nm internal rotation and 10-Nm valgus torques) were recorded between 0 degrees and 60 degrees. Kinematic changes were measured and compared with the intact state for all reconstructed and sectioned states. Results: Anatomic ALLR at all graft fixation angles significantly overconstrained internal rotation of the knee joint beyond 30 degrees of flexion and at 45 degrees and 60 degrees during the pivot-shift test. Furthermore, there were no significant knee kinematic differences between any tested graft fixation angles during anterior drawer, pivot-shift, and internal rotation tests. Conclusion: Anatomic ALLR in conjunction with an ACLR significantly reduced rotatory laxity of the knee beyond 30 degrees of knee flexion. However, ALLR, regardless of fixation angle, resulted in significant overconstraint of the knee. Clinical Relevance: ALLR at any fixation angle overconstrained native joint kinematics and should be performed with careful consideration. Further investigation into the application and target population for ALLR is strongly recommended.","[Schon, Jason M.; Moatshe, Gilbert; Brady, Alex W.; Cruz, Raphael Serra; Chahla, Jorge; Dornan, Grant J.; Turnbull, Travis Lee; Engebretsen, Lars; LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Vail, CO USA; [Schon, Jason M.; Moatshe, Gilbert; Brady, Alex W.; Cruz, Raphael Serra; Chahla, Jorge; Dornan, Grant J.; Turnbull, Travis Lee; LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, 181 W Meadow Dr,Suite 1000, Vail, CO 81657 USA; [Moatshe, Gilbert; Engebretsen, Lars] Oslo Univ Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Oslo, Norway; [Moatshe, Gilbert] OSTRC, Oslo, Norway; [Cruz, Raphael Serra] Inst Brasil Tecnol Saude, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Engebretsen, Lars] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Oslo, Norway; [LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Clin, Vail, CO USA",Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Steadman Philippon Research Institute; University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"LaPrade, RF (corresponding author), Steadman Philippon Res Inst, 181 W Meadow Dr,Suite 1000, Vail, CO 81657 USA.",drlaprade@sprivail.org,"LaPrade, Robert/AFA-8673-2022; Dornan, Grant/ABC-7409-2020","LaPrade, Robert/0000-0002-9823-2306; Dornan, Grant/0000-0001-9039-9163",Smith Nephew; Synthes; Tornier; Zimmer-Biomet; Wright Medical Technology Inc; Arthrex Inc; Biomet; Ossur,Smith Nephew; Synthes; Tornier; Zimmer-Biomet; Wright Medical Technology Inc; Arthrex Inc; Biomet; Ossur,"One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: Arthrex Inc provided in-kind donation of surgical supplies and AlloSource provided in-kind donation of allograft tissues.

This has largely been due to a better understanding of ACL anatomy and in particular a precise description of the femoral and tibial insertions of its two bundles. In the 1980s, the gold standard was anteromedial bundle reconstruction using the middle third of the patellar ligament. Insufficient control of rotational laxity led to the development of double bundle ACL reconstruction. This concept, combined with a growing interest in preservation of the ACL remnant, led in turn to selective reconstruction in partial tears, and more recently to biological reconstruction with ACL remnant conservation. Current ACL reconstruction techniques are not uniform, depending on precise analysis of the type of lesion and the aspect of the ACL remnant in the intercondylar notch.","[Chambat, Pierre; Sonnery-Cottet, Bertrand; Fayard, Jean-Marie; Thaunat, Mathieu] Ctr Orthoped Santy, Unite Genou, F-69008 Lyon, France",,"Chambat, P (corresponding author), Ctr Orthoped Santy, Unite Genou, 1Er Etage,24 Ave Paul Santy, F-69008 Lyon, France.",pierre.chambat@wanadoo.fr; guier@jhmail.com; sonnerycottet@aol.com; docteur.fayard@gmail.com; mathieuthaunat@yahoo.fr,,"Sonnery-Cottet, Bertrand/0000-0002-6837-0425",,,,,56,177,217,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0341-2695,1432-5195,,INT ORTHOP,Int.

ACL injuries are frequently associated with damage of other structures within the knee, such as the meniscus. The meniscus is an important structure that provides protection for articular cartilage and stabilization of the joint. Long-term studies of PTOA after ACLR mainly used radiographs. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used in a limited number of studies to evaluate structural damages, but this only provides information on morphologic changes that occur at relatively late stages of the disease. In this study, we aim to use quantitative MRI (qMRI) to evaluate cartilage and meniscus degeneration in patients at 10 years after ACLR. Methods: This is a multi-site multi-vendor study that involves three sites and two MR platforms (Siemens 3T and Philips 3T). MRI protocols have been harmonized between sites and cross validation data were collected using phantoms. The patients are from a nested cohort within Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Onsite Cohort at 10 years after ACLR. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were: 22-50 years old; ACL tear during a sport; no previous knee injury; no graft rupture during follow-up. In this preliminary report, 51 patients (age 32.8 +/- 6.4 years; 25 females; body mass index [BMI] 25.7 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2); 40 hamstring autograft, 9 bone-patellar tendonbone autograft, and 2 allograft) and 17 healthy control participants (age 30.8 +/- 7.8 years; 10 females; BMI 23.8 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2)) were studied. The MRI protocol included high-resolution Dual-Echo Steady State (DESS), and combined gradient echo MAPSS T1. and T2 mapping. Cartilage and meniscus were automatically segmented on DESS images using an in-house developed deeplearning model into medial/lateral femoral condyle (MFC/LFC), medial/lateral tibia (MT/LT), trochlear (TRO), and patellar cartilage (PAT), and medial and lateral menisci (MM/LM). Each cartilage compartment was further divided into sub-regions based on a modified MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) definition: central and posterior for MFC/LMC (cMFC/cLMC, pMFC/pLMC); anterior, central, and posterior for MT/LT (aMT/aLT, cMT/cLT, pMT/pLT); medial, central, and lateral for PAT/TRO (mPAT/mTRO, cPAT/cTRO, lPAT/lTRO). Menisci were further divided into anterior horn (aMM, aLM), central (body) (cMM, cLM), and posterior horn (pMM, pLM) subregions. These cartilage and menisci subregions were then transformed and overlaid onto the T1. and T2 parameter maps after co-registering the DESS image to the first echo of the 3D MAPSS sequence using the Elastix toolbox. T1. and T2 parameter maps were obtained by a voxel-wise two-parameter monoexponential fitting. The mean and standard deviation for each subregion was recorded and compared between three knee groups: operated and contralateral knees from patients, and control knees from healthy controls, using a mixed-effects regression model, adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Results: For cartilage, compared to contralateral knees, operated knees in patients had significantly higher T1. and T2 values in MFC, MT, and TRO compartments. Looking into subcompartments, for MFC, MT, and TRO, most of the subcompartments (cMFC, pMFC; cMT, pMT; mTRO, cTRO) showed significantly higher T1. and T2 values compared to contralateral knees. For LFC and LT, only the posterior subcompartments showed significantly higher T1. and T2 values compared to contralateral knees. For PAT, no significant differences were observed between operated and contralateral knees. Compared to healthy control knees, operated knees in patients had significantly higher T1. and T2 values in all the six compartments. Besides, contralateral knees also showed higher T1. and T2 values in LFC, LT and PAT compartments compared to healthy control knees (Figure 1 for T1., T2 with similar trend was not shown). For meniscus, no significant differences in T1. and T2 values were observed between injured and contralateral knees. Compared to healthy control knees, both operated and contralateral knees in patients had significantly higher T1. values in LM and significantly higher T2 values in MM (Figure 2). Conclusions: Cartilage T1. and T2 values were higher in operated knees compared to contralateral knees at 10 years after ACLR, except for patellar compartment. In patellar cartilage, no significant differences were observed between sides in patients, but both sides were significantly higher than control knees. Our data showed that contralateral knees after ACLR may not represent `healthy controls' as there might be compensatory changes and early degeneration in contralateral knees as a result of injury and surgery to their other knee. Although we observed this general trend of higher cartilage T1. and T2 values in the operated knees compared to contralateral knees, no significant differences were observed in meniscus T1. and T2 values between sides in patients, suggesting the timing of cartilage and meniscus degeneration may be different for patients after ACLR. Meniscus T1. and T2 values in both sides are higher than control knees, suggesting early degeneration in meniscus in patients in both sides. The results will be confirmed with more patient data being collected in the ongoing study. The relationship between qMRI, morphological tissue changes, and patient-reported outcomes after ACLR will also be evaluated in future work.","Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Cleveland Clin, Sports Hlth Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Cleveland Clin, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Vanderbilt University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,,,"Withrow, Laura/KRF-1099-2024; Jones, Morgan/ABG-3503-2021; Gaj, Sibaji/AAE-8920-2022; Lartey, Richard/KPA-0903-2024",,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",,2325-9671,,ORTHOP J SPORTS MED,Orthop.

The influence of these procedures on knee kinematics is controversial. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to investigate the biomechanical properties of anatomic anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction and a modified Lemaire procedure (lateral extra-articular tenodesis [LET]) in combination with ACL reconstruction as compared with isolated ACL reconstruction in the setting of deficient anterolateral structures (ALL and Kaplan fibers). It was hypothesized that both techniques would reduce tibial internal rotation when combined with ACL reconstruction in the setting of anterolateral structure deficiency. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A 6 degrees of freedom robotic system was used to assess tibial internal rotation, a simulated pivot-shift test, and anterior tibial translation in 10 paired fresh-frozen cadaveric knees. The following states were tested: intact; sectioned ACL, ALL, and Kaplan fibers; ACL reconstruction; and an anterolateral extra-articular procedure (various configurations of ALL reconstruction and LET). Knees within a pair were randomly assigned to either ALL reconstruction or LET with a graft tension of 20 N and a randomly assigned fixation angle (30 degrees or 70 degrees). ALL reconstruction was then repeated and secured with a graft tension of 40 N. Results: In the setting of deficient anterolateral structures, ACL reconstruction was associated with significantly increased residual laxity for tibial internal rotation (up to 4 degrees) and anterior translation (up to 2 mm) laxity as compared with the intact state. The addition of ALL reconstruction or LET after ACL reconstruction significantly reduced tibial internal rotation in most testing scenarios to values lower than the intact state (ie, overconstraint). Significantly greater reduction in laxity with internal rotation and pivot-shift testing was found with the LET procedure than ALL reconstruction when compared with the intact state. Combined with ACL reconstruction alone, both extra-articular procedures restored anterior tibial translation to values not significantly different from the intact state with most testing scenarios (usually within 1 mm). Conclusion: Residual laxity was identified after isolated ACL reconstruction in the setting of ALL and Kaplan fiber deficiency, and the combination of ACL reconstruction in this setting with either ALL reconstruction or the modified Lemaire LET procedure resulted in significant reductions in tibiofemoral motion at most knee flexion angles, although overconstraint was also identified. ALL reconstruction and LET restored anterior tibial translation to intact values with most testing states. Clinical Relevance: ALL reconstruction and lateral extra-articular tenodesis have been described in combination with intra-articular ACL reconstruction to address rotational laxity. This study demonstrated that both procedures resulted in significant reductions of tibial internal rotation versus the intact state independent of graft tension or fixation angle, although anterior tibial translation was generally restored to intact values. The influence of overconstraint with anterolateral knee reconstruction procedures has not been fully evaluated in the clinical setting and warrants continued evaluation based on the findings of this biomechanical study.","[Geeslin, Andrew G.; Moatshe, Gilbert; Chahla, Jorge; Kruckeberg, Bradley M.; Muckenhirn, Kyle J.; Dornan, Grant J.; Coggins, Ashley; Brady, Alex W.; Getgood, Alan M.; Godin, Jonathan A.; LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Vail, CO USA; [Moatshe, Gilbert] Oslo Univ Hosp, Oslo, Norway; [Moatshe, Gilbert] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Moatshe, Gilbert] Norwegian Sch Sports Sci, OSTRC, Oslo, Norway; [Getgood, Alan M.] Univ Western Ontario, Fowler Kennedy Sport Med Clin, London, ON, Canada; [LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Clin, Vail, CO USA",Steadman Philippon Research Institute; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; Norwegian School of Sport Sciences; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"LaPrade, RF (corresponding author), Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Steadman Clin, 181 West Meadow Dr,Suite 400, Vail, CO 81657 USA.",drlaprade@sprivail.org,"Geeslin, Andrew/AAL-8969-2020; Getgood, Alan/D-1147-2015; Dornan, Grant/ABC-7409-2020; LaPrade, Robert/AFA-8673-2022","Kruckeberg, Bradley/0009-0003-3878-7830; Dornan, Grant/0000-0001-9039-9163; LaPrade, Robert/0000-0002-9823-2306",Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Arthrex; Smith and Nephew; DJO; South Eastern Norway Health Authority; Arthrex Inc.; Arthrex Inc; Smith Nephew; Linvatec; Ossur,Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Arthrex; Smith and Nephew; DJO; South Eastern Norway Health Authority; Arthrex Inc.; Arthrex Inc; Smith Nephew; Linvatec; Ossur,"One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: Internal funding for this study was received from the Steadman Philippon Research Institute.

Altered hip and ankle muscle co-contraction patterns may contribute to dynamic knee valgus and ACL injury mechanisms. Lack of dynamic control of ground reaction force (GRF) is known to be contributing factor for ACL injury by placing excessive force on passive structures. Muscle co-contraction is a dynamic mechanism for GRF absorption. Therefore, any alterations in co-contraction might be a risk factor for ACL injury. Ligament dominance is a term to define individuals who rely more on ACL ligament for GRF control. Research question: This study aimed to compare the muscle co-contraction patterns of distal and proximal knee muscles during single leg landing in female athletes with and without ligament dominance. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 54 female athletes were assigned to the healthy (n = 27) and ligament dominance (n = 27) group based on their Tuck Jump test scores. The electromyography activity of the gluteus medius, adductor longus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured by an electromyography in drop down a 30-cm-high stair. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis (p <= 0.05). Results: The two groups demonstrated an overall significantly different muscle co-contraction patterns (P < 0.05). There was a decreased in co-contraction of proximal group and an increased co-contraction in the distal muscles in ligament dominant group. Significance: The findings have provided evidence to support the notion of neuromuscular imbalances in ligament dominance deficit. These findings can be useful for the coaches and experts to design preventive exercises and modify the current programs for the people affected by ligament dominance.","[Saki, Farzaneh; Khou, Shima Bakhtiari] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Dept Sport Injuries & Correct Exercise, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Tahayori, Behdad] Univ St Augustine Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Therapy, Miami, FL USA",Bu Ali Sina University,"Saki, F (corresponding author), Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Dept Sport Injuries & Correct Exercise, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran.",f_saki@basu.ac.ir,,"Bakhtiarikhou, Shima/0000-0002-6147-159X",,,,,45,5,6,0,10,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0966-6362,1879-2219,,GAIT POSTURE,Gait Posture,MAR,2022,93,,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2022.02.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2022.02.011,,FEB 2022,5,Neurosciences; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics; Sport Sciences,2Q0PV,35183840,,,,2025-12-29,WOS:000820132400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that the effects of combined ACL and posterolateral corner reconstruction would be less satisfactory than those of isolated ACL reconstruction in terms of anterior laxity and clinical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively studied sixty-nine patients Who underwent ACL reconstruction from February 2001 to December 2005. Forty-six patients underwent isolated ACL reconstruction (Group l), and twenty-three patients underwent combined ACL and posterolatera I corner reconstruction (Group II). Clinical outcomes were determined from data obtained before surgery and at the time of the twenty-four-month follow-up examination. Results: Postoperatively, the mean side-to-side difference (and standard deviation) in anterior tibial translation, measured with a KT2000 arthrometer, was greater for Group 1(2.2 +/- 1.0 mm) than for Group 11 (1.6 +/- 0.8 mm) (p = 0.031). Seven knees (15.2%) in Group land two knees (8.7%) in Group II had grade-1 anterior translation. The mean Lysholm score was 93.2 in Group I and 90.1 in Group II (p = 0.392). Thirty-eight knees (82.6%) in Group I and twenty knees (87.0%) in Group II were classified as normal or nearly normal according to the International Knee Documentation Committee scoring system (p = 0.882). Conclusions: On the basis of the evaluation of ligamentous laxity with use of the KT2000 arthrometer, we observed that combined ACL and posterolateral corner reconstruction allows less anterior translation than isolated ACL reconstruction. However, we could not identify significant differences between the two groups in terms of functional outcomes.","[Kim, Sung-Jae; Choi, Duck-Hyun; Hwang, Byoung-Yoon] Yonsei Univ Hlth Syst, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Arthroscopy & Joint Res Inst, Seoul 120752, South Korea",Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System,"Kim, SJ (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ Hlth Syst, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Arthroscopy & Joint Res Inst, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120752, South Korea.",sogood95@hanmail.net,,"Kim, Sung-Jae/0000-0001-8357-3426",,,,,40,39,46,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0021-9355,1535-1386,,J BONE JOINT SURG AM,J.

A distinct lateral structure, the anterolateral ligament, has been identified, and reconstruction strategies for this tissue in combination with ACL reconstruction have been proposed. However, the biomechanical function of the anterolateral ligament is not well understood. Thus, this study had two research questions: (1) What is the contribution of the anterolateral ligament to knee stability in the ACL-sectioned knee? (2) Does the anterolateral ligament bear increased load in the absence of the ACL? Methods: Twelve cadaveric knees from donors who were a mean (and standard deviation) of 43 +/- 15 years old at the time of death were loaded using a robotic manipulator to simulate clinical tests of the pivot shift and anterior stability. Motions were recorded with the ACL intact, with the ACL sectioned, and with both the ACL and anterolateral ligament sectioned. In situ loads borne by the ACL and anterolateral ligament in the ACL-intact knee and borne by the anterolateral ligament in the ACL-sectioned knee were determined. Results: Sectioning the anterolateral ligament in the ACL-sectioned knee led to mean increases of 2 to 3 mm in anterior tibial translation in both anterior stability and simulated pivot-shift tests. In the ACL-intact knee, the load borne by the anterolateral ligament was a mean of <= 10.2 N in response to anterior loads and <17 N in response to the simulated pivot shift. In the ACL-sectioned knee, the load borne by the anterolateral ligament increased on average to < 55% of the load normally borne by the ACL in the intact knee. However, in the ACL-sectioned knee, the anterolateral ligament engaged only after the tibia translated beyond the physiologic limits of motion of the ACL-intact knee. Conclusions: The anterolateral ligament is a secondary stabilizer compared with the ACL for the simulated Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot shift examinations.","[Thein, Ran; Boorman-Padgett, James; Stone, Kyle; Wickiewicz, Thomas L.; Imhauser, Carl W.; Pearle, Andrew D.] Hosp Special Surg, Dept Biomech, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Thein, Ran] Chaim Sheba Med Ctr, Dept Orthoped Surg, IL-52621 Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Wickiewicz, Thomas L.; Pearle, Andrew D.] Hosp Special Surg, Dept Orthoped Surg, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021 USA",Chaim Sheba Medical Center; Tel Aviv University,"Thein, R (corresponding author), Hosp Special Surg, Dept Biomech, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021 USA.;Thein, R (corresponding author), Chaim Sheba Med Ctr, Dept Orthoped Surg, IL-52621 Tel Hashomer, Israel.",ranthein@gmail.com; BoormanPadgettJ@hss.edu; kstone3@binghamton.edu; WickiewiczT@hss.edu; ImhauserC@hss.edu; PearleA@hss.edu,,"Boorman-Padgett, James/0000-0002-3074-3281",Kirby Foundation; Clark Foundation; Institute for Sports Medicine Research; Surgeon in Chief Fund at the Hospital for Special Surgery; Gosnell Family,Kirby Foundation; Clark Foundation; Institute for Sports Medicine Research; Surgeon in Chief Fund at the Hospital for Special Surgery; Gosnell Family,"This investigation was supported by the Kirby Foundation, the Clark Foundation, the Institute for Sports Medicine Research, the Surgeon in Chief Fund at the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the Gosnell Family.

This will improve understanding of their potential contribution to residual anterolateral rotational laxity after ACL reconstruction and may influence selection of an anterolateral extra-articular reconstruction technique, which is currently a matter of debate. Hypothesis/Purpose: To compare the role of the ALL and the Kaplan fibers in stabilizing the knee against tibial internal rotation, anterior tibial translation, and the pivot shift in ACL-deficient knees. We hypothesized that the Kaplan fibers would provide greater tibial internal rotation restraint than the ALL in ACL-deficient knees and that both structures would provide restraint against internal rotation during a simulated pivot-shift test. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten paired fresh-frozen cadaveric knees (n = 20) were used to investigate the effect of sectioning the ALL and the Kaplan fibers in ACL-deficient knees with a 6 degrees of freedom robotic testing system. After ACL sectioning, sectioning was randomly performed for the ALL and the Kaplan fibers. An established robotic testing protocol was utilized to assess knee kinematics when the specimens were subjected to a 5-N.m internal rotation torque (0 degrees-90 degrees at 15 degrees increments), a simulated pivot shift with 10-N.m valgus and 5-N.m internal rotation torque (15 degrees and 30 degrees), and an 88-N anterior tibial load (30 degrees and 90 degrees). Results: Sectioning of the ACL led to significantly increased tibial internal rotation (from 0 degrees to 90 degrees) and anterior tibial translation (30 degrees and 90 degrees) as compared with the intact state. Significantly increased internal rotation occurred with further sectioning of the ALL (15 degrees-90 degrees) and Kaplan fibers (15 degrees, 60 degrees-90 degrees). At higher flexion angles (60 degrees-90 degrees), sectioning the Kaplan fibers led to significantly greater internal rotation when compared with ALL sectioning. On simulated pivot-shift testing, ALL sectioning led to significantly increased internal rotation and anterior translation at 15 degrees and 30 degrees; sectioning of the Kaplan fibers led to significantly increased tibial internal rotation at 15 degrees and 30 degrees and anterior translation at 15 degrees. No significant difference was found when anterior tibial translation was compared between the ACL/ALL- and ACL/Kaplan fiber-deficient states on simulated pivot-shift testing or isolated anterior tibial load. Conclusion: The ALL and Kaplan fibers restrain internal rotation in the ACL-deficient knee. Sectioning the Kaplan fibers led to greater tibial internal rotation at higher flexion angles (60 degrees-90 degrees) as compared with ALL sectioning. Additionally, the ALL and Kaplan fibers contribute to restraint of the pivot shift and anterior tibial translation in the ACL-deficient knee.","[Geeslin, Andrew G.; Chahla, Jorge; Moatshe, Gilbert; Muckenhirn, Kyle J.; Kruckeberg, Bradley M.; Brady, Alex W.; Coggins, Ashley; Dornan, Grant J.; Getgood, Alan M.; Godin, Jonathan A.; LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Vail, CO USA; [Moatshe, Gilbert] Oslo Univ Hosp, Oslo, Norway; [Moatshe, Gilbert] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Moatshe, Gilbert] Norwegian Sch Sports Sci, Oslo Sports Trauma Res Ctr, Oslo, Norway; [Getgood, Alan M.] Univ Western Ontario, Fowler Kennedy Sport Med Clin, London, ON, Canada; [LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Clin, Vail, CO USA",Steadman Philippon Research Institute; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; Norwegian School of Sport Sciences; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"LaPrade, RF (corresponding author), Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Steadman Clin, 181 West Meadow Dr,Suite 400, Vail, CO 81657 USA.",drlaprade@sprivail.org,"Dornan, Grant/ABC-7409-2020; Geeslin, Andrew/AAL-8969-2020; Getgood, Alan/D-1147-2015; LaPrade, Robert/AFA-8673-2022","Dornan, Grant/0000-0001-9039-9163; Kruckeberg, Bradley/0009-0003-3878-7830; LaPrade, Robert/0000-0002-9823-2306",Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Arthrex Inc; South-Eastern Norway Health Authority; DePuy; Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals Inc; Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation; Smith Nephew; Conmed Linvatec; Ossur; SBM Inc; Linvatec,Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Arthrex Inc; South-Eastern Norway Health Authority; DePuy; Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals Inc; Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation; Smith Nephew; Conmed Linvatec; Ossur; SBM Inc; Linvatec,"This study was funded internally by the Steadman Philippon Research Institute.

Methods: Twelve cadaveric knees were studied using a testing machine to assess the internal tibial rotation and anterior tibial translation across six surgical states: intact knee, ACL lesion, ACL + ALL lesion, ACL isolated reconstruction, ACL + ALL anatomical reconstruction and ACL + LET procedure. ALL and LET grafts were fixed at full knee extension and neutral rotation. Results: Presented with combined ACL and ALL lesions, isolated ACL reconstruction failed to restore the internal tibial rotation to intact-knee values (P> 0.05 for all angles). The addition of both an ALL reconstruction and LET procedure significantly reduced the internal rotation, restoring the rotation laxity to intact-knee values at 0 degrees and 30 degrees of flexion (P < 0.05) and with a certain level of overconstraint at 60 degrees and 90 degrees (mean 3 degrees +/- 2SD). A higher tendency to overconstraint was observed with the LET, but there was no significant difference when comparing the ALL reconstruction with the LET (P > 0.05 for all angles). Conclusions: Residual rotational laxity was found after isolated ACL reconstruction in the presence of an anterolateral lesion. The combination of ACL reconstruction with anatomical ALL reconstruction or the LET procedure resulted in restoration to intact-knee values but with a certain degree of overconstraint in higher flexion angles. Both techniques showed optimal biomechanical results with no data supporting the advantage of one over the other. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Today, we have a large number of approaches to arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament that lead to successful outcomes and allow the patients to return to a significant level of activity post-operatively. Nevertheless, the return to competitions rate stays relatively low. The functional state is thought to be dependent on rotational and anteroposterior stability of the knee. These data encourage search for methods of additional stabilization of the knee joint, one of them being extra-articular tenodesis, or reconstruction of anterolateral ligament of the knee. The aim of the study To evaluate medium-term results of combined simultaneous arthroscopic reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament and anterolateral ligament of the knee joint in sportsmen and to access the probability of return to competitions. Materials and methods The surgeries were performed in 2014-2015 in 50 patients who fulfilled the entry criteria: 20 patients (including 10 professional sportsmen) underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction together with reconstruction of anterolateral ligament-group 1 (main group), and 30 patients (including 10 professional sportsmen) underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction-group 2 (control group). Results Group 1: All patients of group 1 were able to return to the pre-operative sports level in two years after the surgery. The mean Tegner Lysholm score was 72.6 +/- 6.45 (hereinafter, SE-standard error) before the surgery and 97.4 +/- 1.18 after the surgery. The mean IKDC score was 63.1 +/- 4.8% before the surgery and 96.3 +/- 1.8% after the surgery. Group 2: 20 of 30 patients (66.7%) returned to the pre-operative level of activity and returned to competitions (if they were professional sportsmen) in a year after the surgery. Five of ten patients (50%) (professional sportsmen) returned to competitions. Fifteen of 20 patients (75%) (amateur sportsmen) also returned to competitions. The mean pre-operative Tegner Lysholm score was 69.6 +/- 3.5, and the mean post-operative score was 92.1 +/- 3.9. The mean pre-operative IKDC score was 73.4 +/- 3.2%, and the mean post-operative score was 90.3 +/- 3.7%. Conclusion The results of the study show that more patients with higher functional demands and more professional sportsmen returned to sports. Despite the results of our and other foreign studies, a need remains for studies that will compare outcomes of ALL reconstruction with the same surgical technique in homogenous groups of patients.","[Goncharov, Evgeniy Nikolaevich; Goncharov, Nikolay Gavriilovich] Russian Med Acad Continuous Profess Educ, Barrikadnaya St 2-1, Moscow 123242, Russia; [Goncharov, Evgeniy Nikolaevich; Koval, Oleg Aleksandrovich; Filimonova, Anastasiya Mikhaylovna; Goncharov, Nikolay Gavriilovich] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Clin Hosp, Traumatol & Orthoped Ctr, Litovskiy Blvd 1a, Moscow 117593, Russia; [Dubrov, Vadim Erikovich] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Fundamental Med Fac, Leninskie Gory 1, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Bezuglov, Eduard Nikolaevich] IM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Dept Sport Med, Trubetskaya St 8c2, Moscow, Russia; [Filimonova, Anastasiya Mikhaylovna] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Clin Hosp, Diagnostocal Ctr, Radiol Unit, Litovskiy Blvd 1a, Moscow 117593, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Koval, OA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Cent Clin Hosp, Traumatol & Orthoped Ctr, Litovskiy Blvd 1a, Moscow 117593, Russia.",goncharoven@gmail.com; drkovaloa@gmail.com; vdubrov.2015@mail.ru; e.n.bezuglov@gmail.com; nakimkina@mail.ru; goncharovng57@gmail.com,"; Goncharov, Evgeny/C-4691-2017; Koval, Oleg/JCE-5828-2023","Bezuglov, Eduard/0000-0003-3828-0506; Goncharov, Evgeny/0000-0001-9809-7637; Filimonova, Anastasiia/0000-0001-6957-5564; Koval, Oleg/0000-0002-4193-4972;",,,,,34,32,36,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0341-2695,1432-5195,,INT ORTHOP,Int.

Recent publications about the anatomy of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) have led to a renewed interest in lateral extra-articular procedures, and several authors have proposed ALL reconstruction to supplement intra-articular ACL reconstruction. However, only limited knowledge about the biomechanical characteristics of the ALL exists. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to analyze length changes of the ALL during passive knee motion. The study hypothesis was that the ALL lengthens with knee flexion and internal tibial rotation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The ALL of 6 cadaveric knees was dissected. Specimens were mounted in a specifically designed test rig that allowed unconstrained passive flexion/extension movement between 0 degrees and 90 degrees as well as external/internal tibial rotation of 25 degrees at various flexion angles. Highly elastic, capacitive polydimethylsiloxane strain gauges were attached to the insertion sites of the ALL. Length changes were recorded continuously at flexion angles between 0 degrees and 90 degrees and during internal/external tibial rotation at 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees. All measurements were calculated as the relative length change (%) of the ALL compared with 0 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation. Results: The mean relative length of the ALL significantly increased with increasing knee flexion (P < .001), with an estimated mean length change of +0.15% per degree. Both internal and external tibial rotation were independent determinants for length change; internal rotation significantly increased the length of the ALL (P < .001), whereas external rotation significantly decreased its length (P < .001). The mean length change with internal rotation increased with knee flexion, with a significantly greater length change at 90 degrees compared with 0 degrees (P = .048), 15 degrees (P = .033), and 30 degrees (P = .015). The maximum mean length change was +33.77% 9.62%, which was observed at 25 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of flexion. Conclusion: The ALL is a nonisometric structure that tensions with knee flexion and internal tibial rotation. Length changes with internal rotation were greater at higher flexion angles, with the greatest length change of the ALL observed at 90 degrees of flexion. Clinical Relevance: The ALL can be considered a stabilizer against internal tibial rotation, especially at deep flexion angles. With regard to ALL reconstruction procedures, tensioning and fixation of the graft should be performed near 90 degrees of flexion because graft tensioning near extension may cause excessive ligament strain with increasing knee flexion.","[Zens, Martin; Niemeyer, Philipp; Ruhhammer, Johannes; Bernstein, Anke; Woias, Peter; Mayr, Herrmann O.; Suedkamp, Norbert P.; Feucht, Matthias J.] Freiburg Univ Hosp, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Feucht, MJ (corresponding author), Freiburg Univ Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg & Traumatol, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",matthias.feucht@gmx.net,"Suedkamp, Norbert/AAF-2931-2019",,German Knee Society (Deutsche Kniegesellschaft e.V.),German Knee Society (Deutsche Kniegesellschaft e.V.),One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: The study was financially supported by a research grant from the German Knee Society (Deutsche Kniegesellschaft e.V.),,39,70,79,1,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Failure to address ALL injury has been suggested as a cause of persistent rotational laxity after ACL reconstruction. Lateral meniscus posterior root (LMPR) tears have also been shown to cause increased internal rotation of the knee. Qustions/purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the functional relationship between the ALL and LMPR in the control of internal rotation of the ACL-deficient knee. Specifically: (1) We asked if there was a difference in internal rotation among: the intact knee; the ACL-deficient knee; the ACL/ALL-deficient knee; the ACL/LMPR-deficient knee; and the ACL/ALL/LMPR-deficient knee. (2) We also asked if there was a difference in anterior translation among these conditions. Methods Sixteen fresh frozen cadaveric knee specimens (eight men, mean age 79 years) were potted into a hip simulator (femur) and a 6 degree-of-freedom load cell (tibia). Rigid optical trackers were inserted into the proximal femur and distal tibia, allowing for the motion of the tibia with respect to the femur to be tracked during biomechanical tests. A series of points on the femur and tibia were digitized to create bone coordinate systems that were used to calculate internal rotation and anterior translation. Biomechanical testing involved applying a 5-Nm internal rotation moment to the tibia from full extension to 90A degrees of flexion. Anterior translation was performed by applying a 90-N anterior load using a tensiometer. Both tests were performed in 15A degrees increments tested sequentially in the following conditions: (1) intact; and (2) ACL injury (ACL-). The specimens were then randomized to either have the ALL sectioned (3) first (M+/ALL-); or (4) the LMPR sectioned first (M-/ALL+) followed by the other structure (M-/ALL-). A one-way analysis of variance was performed for each sectioning condition at each angle of knee flexion (alpha = 0.05). Results At 0A degrees of flexion there was an effect of tissue sectioning such that internal rotation of the M-/ALL- condition was greater than ACL- by 1.24A degrees (p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-2.70) and the intact condition by 2.5A degrees (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.69-3.91). In addition, the mean (SD) internal rotations for the M+/ALL- (9.99A degrees [5.39A degrees]) and M-/ALL+ (12.05A degrees [5.34A degrees]) were greater by 0.87A degrees (p = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.13-3.83) and by 2.15A degrees, respectively, compared with the intact knee. At 45A degrees the internal rotation for the ACL- (19.15A degrees [9.49A degrees]), M+/ALL- (23.70A degrees [7.00A degrees]), and M-/ALL- (18.80A degrees [8.27A degrees]) conditions was different than the intact (12.78A degrees [9.23A degrees]) condition by 6.37A degrees (p = 0.02; 95% CI, 1.37-11.41), 8.47A degrees (p < 0.01; 95% CI, 3.94-13.00), and 6.02A degrees (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 1.73-10.31), respectively. At 75A degrees there was a 10.11A degrees difference (p < 0.01; 95% CI, 5.20-15.01) in internal rotation between the intact (13.96A degrees [5.34A degrees]) and the M+/ALL- (23.22A degrees [4.46A degrees]) conditions. There was also a 4.08A degrees difference (p = 0.01; 95% CI, 1.14-7.01) between the intact and M-/ALL- (18.05A degrees [7.31A degrees]) conditions. Internal rotation differences of 6.17A degrees and 5.43A degrees were observed between ACL- (16.28A degrees [6.44A degrees]) and M+/ALL- (p < 0.01; 95% CI, 2.45-9.89) as well as between M+/ALL- and M-/ALL- (p = 0.01; 95% CI, -8.17 to -1.63). Throughout the range of flexion, there was no difference in anterior translation with progressive section of the ACL, meniscus, or ALL. Conclusion The ALL and LMPR both play a role in aiding the ACL in controlling internal rotation laxity in vitro; however, these effects seem to be dependent on flexion angle. The ALL has a greater role in controlling internal rotation at flexion angles > 30(o). The LMPR appears to have more of an effect on controlling rotation closer to extension.","[Lording, Timothy] Melbourne Orthopaed Grp, Windsor, Vic, Australia; [Corbo, Gillian] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Anat & Cell Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Bryant, Dianne] Western Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, London, ON, Canada; [Burkhart, Timothy A.] Lawson Hlth Res Inst, London, ON, Canada; [Burkhart, Timothy A.] Western Univ, Dept Surg, London, ON, Canada; [Burkhart, Timothy A.] Western Univ, Dept Mech Engn, London, ON, Canada; [Getgood, Alan] Western Univ, Fowler Kennedy Sport Med Clin, Ctr 3M, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); University Western Ontario Hospital; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Getgood, A (corresponding author), Western Univ, Fowler Kennedy Sport Med Clin, Ctr 3M, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",alan.getgood@uwo.ca,"Burkhart, Timothy/N-8261-2015; Getgood, Alan/D-1147-2015; Bryant, Dianne/K-6766-2013","Burkhart, Timothy/0000-0001-6185-2395;",Lawson Health Research; Department of Surgery at Western University; Canadian Health Research Institute,Lawson Health Research; Department of Surgery at Western University; Canadian Health Research Institute(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"Research funding support was received from an unrestricted internal research grant from Lawson Health Research (AG), the Department of Surgery at Western University (AG), and the Canadian Health Research Institute (TAB).",,46,56,60,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0009-921X,1528-1132,,CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R,Clin.

Therefore, the risk of tunnel convergence is increased because of the limited bone volume within the distal aspect of the femur. Purpose: To assess the risk of tunnel convergence and determine the optimal reconstruction tunnel orientations for multiple ligament reconstructions in the femur. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Three-dimensional knee models were developed from computed tomography scans of 21 patients. Medical image processing software was used to create tunnels for each of the primary ligamentous structures, replicating a surgical approach that would be used in multiple ligament reconstructions. Thereafter, the tunnel orientation was varied in surgically relevant directions to determine orientations that minimized the risk of tunnel convergence. The orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tunnels was held constant throughout the study, while the orientation of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), popliteus tendon (PLT), superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL), and posterior oblique ligament (POL) tunnels was varied to avoid convergence. Results: A high risk of tunnel convergence was observed between the FCL and ACL tunnels when the FCL tunnel was aimed at 0 degrees in the axial and coronal planes. Aiming the FCL tunnel 35 degrees anteriorly minimized convergence with the ACL tunnel. No tunnel convergence was observed for the PLT tunnel aimed 35 degrees anteriorly and parallel to the FCL tunnel. To avoid convergence between the sMCL and PCL tunnels, the sMCL tunnels should be aimed 40 degrees proximally in the coronal plane and 20 degrees to 40 degrees anteriorly. During concomitant POL reconstruction, the sMCL should be aimed 40 degrees proximally and anteriorly and the POL 20 degrees proximally and anteriorly. The PLT and POL tunnels aimed at 0 degrees in both the coronal and axial planes had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. Conclusion: Femoral tunnel orientations during multiple ligament reconstructions need to be adjusted to avoid tunnel convergence. On the lateral side, aiming the FCL and PLT tunnels 35 degrees anteriorly eliminated convergence with the ACL tunnel. On the medial side, tunnel convergence was avoided by orienting the sMCL tunnel 40 degrees proximally and anteriorly and the POL tunnel 20 degrees proximally and anteriorly. The POL and PLT tunnels aimed at 0 degrees in the axial plane had an increased risk of violating the intercondylar notch. Clinical Relevance: The risk of tunnel convergence with the ACL and PCL femoral tunnels can be reduced by adjusting the orientation of the FCL and PLT tunnels and the sMCL and POL tunnels, respectively.","[Moatshe, Gilbert; Brady, Alex W.; Slette, Erik L.; Chahla, Jorge; Turnbull, Travis Lee; Engebretsen, Lars; LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Vail, CO USA; [Moatshe, Gilbert; Brady, Alex W.; Slette, Erik L.; Chahla, Jorge; Turnbull, Travis Lee; Engebretsen, Lars; LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Philippon Res Inst, 181 West Meadow Dr,Suite 1000, Vail, CO 81657 USA; [Moatshe, Gilbert; Engebretsen, Lars] Oslo Univ Hosp, Oslo, Norway; [Moatshe, Gilbert; Engebretsen, Lars] Oslo Sports Trauma Res Ctr, Norwegian Sch Sport Sci, Oslo, Norway; [LaPrade, Robert F.] Steadman Clin, Vail, CO USA",Steadman Philippon Research Institute; Steadman Philippon Research Institute; University of Oslo; Norwegian School of Sport Sciences,"Moatshe, G (corresponding author), Steadman Philippon Res Inst, 181 West Meadow Dr,Suite 1000, Vail, CO 81657 USA.",gilbert.moatshe@medisin.uio.no,"LaPrade, Robert/AFA-8673-2022","LaPrade, Robert/0000-0002-9823-2306",Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority [2014089]; Arthrex Inc.; Biomet; Smith Nephew; Ossur; Linvatec,Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority; Arthrex Inc.; Biomet; Smith Nephew; Ossur; Linvatec,"This study was funded by a research grant from the Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (project No. 2014089).

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to examine the rotational and valgus laxity with ACL strain following sMCL and POL repair with suture tape augmentation at various degrees of knee flexion. It was hypothesized that this technique would restore knee laxity and kinematics comparable with those of the intact state. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Ten cadaveric knee specimens (mean +/- SD, 57.9 +/- 5.9 years) were obtained. Specimens were tested with the tibia fixed and the femur mobile on an X-Y table. Each specimen was tested in 4 conditions according to the state of the sMCL and POL: native, deficient, repaired with suture tape augmentation, and reconstructed with tendon allografts. Valgus laxity was tested with 40-N force applied in the lateral direction of the femur, and rotational motion was tested with 5-N torque applied to the tibia. ACL strain during valgus stress was also measured. Each condition was tested in 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees of knee flexion. Results: Dissection of the sMCL and POL led to significantly increased valgus laxity in all flexion angles, with a significant increase in ACL strain at 30 degrees (P < .001) and 45 degrees (P < .001). Ligament repair with suture tape augmentation demonstrated similar valgus and rotational laxity as compared with intact specimens, with the exception of increased internal rotation at 30 degrees (P = .005). Ligament reconstruction resulted in significantly increased valgus opening at 45 degrees (P = .048) and significantly increased internal rotation at 30 degrees (P < .001) as compared with the native state. Direct comparison between surgical techniques showed no significant differences. Conclusion: At time zero, ligament repair of the posteromedial knee with suture tape augmentation restored close-to-native valgus and rotatory laxity, as well as native ACL strain for cases of complete sMCL and POL avulsion.","[Mehl, Julian T.; Kia, Cameron; Murphy, Matthew; Obopilwe, Elifho; Cote, Mark; Imhoff, Florian B.; Imhoff, Andreas B.; Arciero, Robert A.; Beitzel, Knut; Otto, Alexander] UConn Hlth, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Farmington, CT USA; [Mehl, Julian T.; Imhoff, Florian B.; Imhoff, Andreas B.; Beitzel, Knut; Otto, Alexander] Tech Univ, Dept Orthopaed Sports Med, Ismaninger Str 22, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Mehl, Julian T.; Kia, Cameron; Murphy, Matthew; Obopilwe, Elifho; Cote, Mark; Imhoff, Florian B.; Arciero, Robert A.; Otto, Alexander] Univ Connecticut, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Farmington, CT USA",Technical University of Munich; University of Connecticut,"Mehl, JT (corresponding author), Tech Univ, Dept Orthopaed Sports Med, Ismaninger Str 22, D-81675 Munich, Germany.",julianmehl@gmx.de,"Imhoff, Andreas/E-8829-2013; Imhoff, Florian/JXY-6159-2024","Imhoff, Florian/0000-0002-2159-2071",Arthrex; DonJoy,Arthrex; DonJoy,"One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: K.B. receives consultant fees for Arthrex.

Its main function is to prevent the posterior dislocation of the tibia in relation to the femur, providing 95% of the strength to resist the tibial posterior displacement. Along with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) the PCL controls the passive 'screw home' mechanism of the knee in terminal knee extension. It also provides mechanical support for the collateral ligaments during valgus or varus stress of the knee. PCL ruptures are uncommon apparently due to its strong fibre structure. The most frequent injury mechanism in isolated PCL tears is a direct blow on the anterior tibia with the knee flexed thus driving the tibia posteriorly. Automobile accidents (in which the knee hits the dashboard) and soccer injuries (in which an athlete receives a blow to the anterior surface of the tibia during knee flexion) characteristically produce this type of injury. In other PCL injury mechanisms (hyperextension, hyperflexion or rotational injuries with associated valgum/varum stress), other knee structures are also often damaged. The most characteristic diagnostic finding in a knee with a PCL rupture is the 'posterior sag sign' meaning the apparent disappearance of the tibial tubercle in lateral inspection when the knee is flexed 90-degrees. This is due to gravity-assisted posterior displacement of the tibia in relation to the femur. A positive posterior drawer test performed at 90-degrees of flexion and a knee hyperextension sign are sensitive but nonspecific tests. False negative findings are frequent, especially in acute cases. If necessary, the clinical diagnosis of the PCL tear can be verified by magnetic resonance imaging, examination under anaesthesia, arthroscopy, or a combination of these modalities. If a PCL avulsion fragment has been dislocated, surgical treatment is recommended. In isolated, complete midsubstance tears of the PCL the majority of the recent studies recommend conservative treatment, since abnormal residual posterior laxity1 in most of these knees is consistent with functional stability and minimal symptoms. This has been the case even in athletes. In isolated PCL tears, the outcome seems to depend more on the muscular (quadriceps) status of the knee than on the amount of residual posterior laxity. Therefore, the conservative treatment protocol emphasises intensive quadriceps exercises, and only a short (under 2 weeks) immobilisation period followed by early controlled activities and early weightbearing. According to the current concept, acute phase surgery (primary PCL repair with augmentation, or primary PCL reconstruction) is indicated in fresh injuries of the PCL associated with disruptions of other major ligaments or capsular structures. Simultaneously with the PCL surgery, all the other damaged structures should also be repaired. Even with surgery, however, the prognosis is poorer than in isolated PCL tears. In chronic PCL insufficiency a reconstruction with bonepatella tendon-bone autograft or allograft can be considered, if the patient suffers from repeated giving way symptoms which are not resolved by rehabilitation.",,,"KANNUS, P (corresponding author), TAMPERE RES STN SPORTS MED,KAUPINPUISTONKATU 1,SF-33500 TAMPERE,FINLAND.",,"Yasuda, Kazunori/C-9998-2009",,"PHS HHS [R0139213, R0140174] Funding Source: Medline",PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service),,,0,72,85,0,20,ADIS INTERNATIONAL LTD,AUCKLAND,"41 CENTORIAN DR, PRIVATE BAG 65901, MAIRANGI BAY, AUCKLAND 10, NEW ZEALAND",0112-1642,,,SPORTS MED,Sports Med.,AUG,1991,12,2,,,,,110,131,,10.2165/00007256-199112020-00004,http://dx.doi.org/10.2165/00007256-199112020-00004,,,22,Sport Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Sport Sciences,FZ359,1947532,,,,2025-12-29,WOS:A1991FZ35900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In such cases, isolated treatment of the central pillar seems insufficient. Therefore, additional stabilization of the medial capsule-ligamentous complex should be considered to prevent, among other things, early graft failure.In the present case, anteromedial rotational instability was treated with a minimally invasive single-strand reconstruction of the sMCL.

Both a high level of suspicion and a thorough clinical and radiographic examination are mandatory to diagnose and identify all injured structures. Reconstruction of all injured ligaments is recommended to aid in early mobilization and to avoid joint stiffness or graft failure. For knee dislocations involving injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and medial-sided structures, a repair and augmentation of the medial collateral ligament, together with an anatomic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament and double-bundle posterior cruciate ligament, is recommended. In the setting of these complex reconstructions, there are several technical aspects that require consideration to ensure concise and efficient treatment of these injuries. Graft choice, sequence of reconstruction, tunnel position and orientation, and graft tensioning all pose surgical challenges, and require dedicated preoperative preparation and planning.

To date, there are no studies that reported donor ankle functional outcomes when a peroneus longus graft is harvested without performing a tenodesis to peroneus brevis. Methods: A single -center retrospective comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcomes (IKDC & Tegner-Lysholm scores) of primary isolated single bundle anatomic ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus tendon (PL group) versus Hamstring (HT group) autografts. Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. Results: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre -op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre -op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre -op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre -op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site. Conclusion: Peroneus longus tendon appears to be a better autograft choice than hamstrings for primary ACL reconstruction. Further, without a peroneal tenodesis, the functional outcomes of the donor ankle remained excellent.

Several graft possibilities are available, including (BPTB), four-strand hamstring autografts, quadriceps tendon, and peroneus longus tendon. Each has both advantages and cons. This study compares the effectiveness of peroneus longus and hamstring tendon autografts for single bundle ACL restoration.Patients and MethodsThe study involved 60 patients. Thirty of them had their torn anterior cruciate ligaments reconstructed arthroscopically using hamstring tendons, while the other 30 had their ACLs managed arthroscopically with peroneus longus tendon. The follow-up period lasted at least 12 months. Patients were assessed using IKDC score and Lysholm score. Ankle function was assessed using AOFAS score.ResultsThere was a statistically significant difference in preoperative and postoperative range of motion improvement in each group as an IKDC score item. However, no statistically significant difference existed between both groups. A statistically significant change in Lysholm scores preoperatively and postoperatively in each group was detected, but there was no statistical difference between groups 1 and 2, either in terms of improvement or percentage improvement. The AOFAS score was used also to assess for any donor site morbidity. No significant difference was detected between both ankles range of motion and no ankle joint dysfunction or problems with sports activities.ConclusionThe current study found that the PL tendon autograft might be considered a safe, effective and a technically easy graft option for ACLR. The research shows no substantial difference in postoperative knee stability or graft failure rate between hamstring and peroneus tendons.","[Ali, Mohamed; El-Shafie, Mohamed; El-Sheikh, Mohamed; Waly, Ahmed] Alexandria Univ, Fac Med, Dept Orthoped Surg & Traumatol, Alexandria, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Alexandria University,"Ali, M (corresponding author), Alexandria Univ, Fac Med, Dept Orthoped Surg & Traumatol, Alexandria, Egypt.",dr.mohamed.mamdouh1990@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2090-5068,2090-5076,,ALEX J MED,Alex.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the biomechanical properties of the PLT to assess its usability in frequently performed reconstructions. Methods: Six fresh-frozen, below-knee cadavers with a mean age of 65 years, no previous surgical operation, and no history of chronic disease were used. PLTs were harvested, freed from muscle tissue, and prepared for tensile strength testing at a tensile force rate of 2 mm/min using a Shimadzu Autograph AG-IS 100 kN instrument (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Results: The maximum tensile force varied between 600.7 N and 1131.313 N, with a median of 758.185 N. All tendons had diameters of 8 mm or more. The elongation at maximum force ranged from 9.0 mm to 16.0 mm, with a median of 14.0 mm. Conclusion: According to this study, PLT is a viable choice for surgeries involving autograft reconstruction.

Peroneus longus (PL) grafts have garnered much attention recently due to ease of harvest and more reliable graft diameters. The present study aimed to study various anthropometric parameters associated with PL-graft diameters. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of 50 patients undergoing PL harvest for ACL surgery at a tertiary referral hospital. Age, gender, height, weight, length of the lower leg (lateral tibial plateau to the tip of the fibula), circumference at the head of the fibula and girth at the lateral malleolus were measured pre-operatively. The length of the graft doubled and tripled graft diameters were assessed intra-operatively. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the association between the pre-operative anthropometric variables and the intra-operative graft diameters and length of graft harvested. Results The mean doubled and tripled PL-graft diameter in our study population was 7.7 +/- 0.9 mm and 8.7 +/- 0.8 mm, respectively. The mean length of the graft was 25.9 +/- 3.5 cm. We found no significant correlation between graft diameters and age, gender or height of the patient. We found that the patient's weight significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with graft diameter. We also found that the length of the lower leg (p < 0.0001), circumference at the head of the fibula (p = 0.001) and girth at the lateral malleolus (p = 0.029) showed significant correlation with tripled PL-graft diameter.

The hypothesis was that US can accurately predict the diameter of 2PLT autografts during operation.MethodsTwenty-six patients underwent ligament reconstruction with 2PLT autografts were included. Preoperative US was used to calculate the in situ PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) at seven levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 cm proximal to the harvest start point). Femoral width, notch width, notch height, maximum patellar length, and patellar tendon length were determined on preoperative radiographs. Intraoperative measurements of PLT were made, including all fiber lengths of PLT and diameters of 2PLT using sizing tubes calibrated to 0.5 mm.ResultsCSA at 1 cm proximal to the harvest site had the highest correlation with the diameter of 2PLT (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Calf length had the highest correlation with PLT length (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The diameter of the 2PLT autografts could be predicted by the following formula: 4.6 + 0.2 x [sonographic CSA of PLT at 1 cm level]; the length of PLT could be predicted by the following formula: 5.6 + 0.5 x Calf length.ConclusionThe diameter of 2PLT and length of PLT autografts can be accurately predicted by preoperative US and calf length measurements, respectively. Accurate preoperative prediction of the diameter and length of autologous grafts can provide the most suitable and individualized graft for patients.","[Luo, Jiewen; Wu, Song; Feng, Jing; Tan, Lingjie; Cao, Yangbo; Liang, Jiehui; He, Jinshen] Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 3, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Changsha 410013, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Rothrauff, Benjamin] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Liao, Qin] Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 3, Dept Anesthesiol, Changsha 410013, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiaoju] Cent South Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Central South University; Central South University,"He, JS (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 3, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Changsha 410013, Hunan, Peoples R China.",jinshen.he@hotmail.com,"; Liao, Qin/H-7275-2018; He, Jinshen/CAG-2514-2022","?, ??/0009-0005-8968-1627;",The Wisdom Accumulation and Talent Cultivation Project of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University [YX202209] Funding Source: Medline,The Wisdom Accumulation and Talent Cultivation Project of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University,,,35,3,3,2,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0942-2056,1433-7347,,KNEE SURG SPORT TR A,Knee Surg.

Methods Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. Results Fifty-two patients (hamstring n = 28, peroneus n = 24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8 +/- 0.7 mm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2 +/- 0.8 mm) (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3 +/- 4.2 and for the FADI 98 +/- 3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p = 0.002). Conclusion Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.","[Rhatomy, Sholahuddin; Wardani, Anggun E.] Univ Gadjah Mada, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Asikin, Asa Ibrahim Zainal; Rukmoyo, Tedjo] Univ Gadjah Mada, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Dr Sardjito Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Lumban-Gaol, Imelda; Budhiparama, Nicolaas C.] Medistra Hosp, Nicolaas Inst Construct Orthopaed Res & Educ Fdn, Jl Jendral Gatot Subroto Kav 59,6th Floor, Dki Jakarta 12950, Indonesia; [Rhatomy, Sholahuddin; Wardani, Anggun E.] RSUP Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro, Jln KRT Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro 1, Klaten, Indonesia; [Asikin, Asa Ibrahim Zainal; Rukmoyo, Tedjo] RSUP Dr Sardjito, Jalan Kesehatan 1, Kabupaten Sleman 55281, Daerah Istimewa, Indonesia; [Wardani, Anggun E.] Univ Gadjah Mada, Dept Radiol, Dr Soeradji Tirtonegoro Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Gadjah Mada University; Gadjah Mada University; Medistra Hospital; Gadjah Mada University,"Budhiparama, NC (corresponding author), Medistra Hosp, Nicolaas Inst Construct Orthopaed Res & Educ Fdn, Jl Jendral Gatot Subroto Kav 59,6th Floor, Dki Jakarta 12950, Indonesia.",pina_mail2000@yahoo.com; n.c.budhiparama@gmail.com,"rhatomy, sholahuddin/U-6158-2019; Gaol, Imelda/AAZ-2935-2021","rhatomy, sholahuddin/0000-0002-5512-6706; Budhiparama, Nicolaas Cyrillus/0000-0002-0801-7400;",,,,,23,75,105,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0942-2056,1433-7347,,KNEE SURG SPORT TR A,Knee Surg.

Methods A total of 21 eligible patients (mean age 34.0 years (standard deviation (SD) 11.2); mean follow-up period 31.8 months (SD 7.7), and 12 healthy controls (mean age, 26.8 years (SD 5.9) were included. For patients, clinical evaluation of the donor ankle was performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Square hop test, ankle strength assessment, and MRI of distal calf were assessed bilaterally in the final follow-up. The morphological symmetry of peroneal tendons bilaterally was evaluated by MRI in healthy controls. Results Among the patients, the mean pre- and postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score and Karisson-Peterson score were 98.7 (SD 2.5; p = 0.480) and 98.5 (SD 2.4; p = 0.480), and 98.3 (SD 2.4; p = 0.162) and 97.9 (SD 2.5; p = 0.162), respectively. There was no significant difference between square hop test bilaterally (p = 0.109) and plantar flexion peak force bilaterally (p = 0.371). The harvested limb had significantly less eversion peak force compared to the contralateral limb (p < 0.001). Evidence of probable tendon regeneration was observed in all the patients by MRI and the total bilateral peroneal tendon index (mean ratio of harvested side cross-sectional area of peroneal tendon compared with the contralateral side) was 82.9% (SD 17.4). In 12 healthy controls, peroneal tendons (mean 99.4% (SD 4.3) were found to be morphologically symmetrical between the two sides. Conclusion The current study showed satisfactory clinical foot and ankle outcomes after full-thickness PLT harvesting and indicated the regenerative potential of PLT after its removal.

Compression downsizing provides a graft of uniform size, allowing easy passage into a smaller tunnel. The purpose of this study was to quantify the graft compression technique and its effects on graft biomechanics and stability. It was hypothesised that compression downsizing would significantly reduce cross-sectional area (CSA); that no significant changes in graft biomechanics would occur; graft fixation stability would be improved. Sixty-eight non-irradiated peroneus longus (PL) tendons were investigated. Twenty were halved and paired into ten four-strand grafts, 20 strands were compressed by 0.5-1 mm diameter and changes in CSA recorded using an alginate mould technique. The following properties were compared with 20 control strands: cyclic strain when loaded 70-220 N for 1000 cycles; stiffness; ultimate tensile load and stress; Young's modulus. 24 PL tendons were quadrupled into grafts, 12 were compressed and all 24 were submerged in Ringer's solution at 37 A degrees C and the CSA recorded over 12 h. Twelve compressed and 12 control quadrupled grafts were mounted in porcine femurs, placed in Ringer's solution for 12 h at 37 A degrees C and graft displacement at the bone tunnel aperture recorded under cyclic loading. Mean decreases in CSA of 31% under a stress of 471 kPa and 21% under a stress of 447 kPa were observed for doubled and quadrupled grafts, respectively. Compressed grafts re-expanded by 19% over 12 h compared to 2% for controls. No significant differences were observed between compressed and control grafts in the biomechanical properties and graft stability; mean cyclic displacements were 0.3 mm for both groups. No detrimental biomechanical effects of graft compression on allograft PL tendons were observed. Following compression, the grafts significantly increased in size during in vitro joint simulation. No significant difference was observed in graft stability between groups. Graft compression did not cause adverse mechanical effects in vitro. Smaller tunnels for compressed grafts reduce bone loss and ease anatomical placement.","[Lord, Breck R.; Amis, Andrew A.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mech Engn, Biomech Grp, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Lord, Breck R.; Wilson, Adrian J.] Basingstoke & North Hampshire Hosp, Basingstoke, Hants, England; [Colaco, Henry B.] St George Hosp, London, England; [Gupte, Chinmay M.; Amis, Andrew A.] Imperial Coll London, Charing Cross Hosp, Dept Surg & Canc, Musculoskeletal Surg Grp,Sch Med, London, England","Imperial College London; City St Georges, University of London; Imperial College London","Amis, AA (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Mech Engn, Biomech Grp, London SW7 2AZ, England.;Amis, AA (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Charing Cross Hosp, Dept Surg & Canc, Musculoskeletal Surg Grp,Sch Med, London, England.",a.amis@imperial.ac.uk,"; Colaco, Henry/ABB-5255-2021","Amis, Anew/0000-0002-4489-1381;",Orthopaedic Research Fund of the North Hampshire Hospital,Orthopaedic Research Fund of the North Hampshire Hospital,"BRL was supported by the Orthopaedic Research Fund of the North Hampshire Hospital.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the existence of a correlation between specific anthropometric parameters and the size of some ankle tendons measured on MRI, in particular those mostly used as graft in ankle surgery. Methods We recorded gender, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of 113 patients (57 females; mean age: 42 +/- 18) who underwent ankle MRI. MRI measurements performed by a radiologist were: axial shortest diameter of Achilles (AT), posterior tibialis (PTT), flexor digitorum longus (FDLT), flexor hallucis longus (FHLT), peroneus longus (PLT), and anterior tibialis (ATT) tendons, intermalleolar distance (ID) and talus width (TW). Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used. After applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, statistical significance was set at p < 0.002. Results The mean patient height, weight and BMI were 169 +/- 9.8 cm (range: 140-193), 72.4 +/- 16.4 kg (range: 44-142), and 25 +/- 5.7 (range: 16-50), respectively. The mean ankle measurements were: AT = 5.3 +/- 1.4 mm, PTT = 3.3 +/- 0.6 mm, FDLT = 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm, FHLT = 2.7 +/- 0.4 mm, PLT = 2.9 +/- 0.5 mm, ATT = 3 +/- 0.6 mm, ID = 62.9 +/- 4.5 mm, and TW = 28.8 +/- 2.5 mm. A statistical difference between male and female patients was observed regarding ID (z = -6.955, p < .001), TW (z = -6.692, p < .001), AT (z = -3.587, p < .001), PTT (z = -3.783, p < .001), and FDLT (z = -3.744, p < .001). Both PTT and FDLT showed a significant correlation with ID (p < .001) and TW (p < .001). ATT size was significantly correlated with weight, ID and TW (all with p < 0.001). PLT and AT showed a significant correlation only with ID and weight (p <= .001), respectively.

An alternative that has received little attention in Europe but is very popular in Asia is harvesting of the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (split graft). The aim of this article is to describe the removal technique of a peroneus longus split graft. The surgical approach is via an approximately 1-2 cm long skin incision posterior to the fibula just above the lateral malleolus. After splitting the subcutaneous layers and the fascia, the peroneus tendons are located: The peroneus longus tendon lies posterior and lateral to the peroneus brevis tendon. This is circumvented with a clamp and incised centrally along the fibers. The anterior half is reinforced with baseball stitch sutures and then severed distally. The anterior half of the tendon is then separated by a tendon stripper and detached from the peroneus longus muscle. The mean graft length is ca. 29 cm. Previous reports on this transplant in the literature have been positive; however, there have been reports of donor site morbidity in the ankle joint.","[Zhou, Ming] Nanchang Hongdu Hosp TCM, Nanchang, Peoples R China; [Petersen, Wolf] Martin Luther Krankenhaus, Klin Orthopad & Unfallchirurg, Berlin, Germany; [Petersen, Wolf] Martin Luther Krankenhaus, Caspar Theys Str 27-31, D-14109 Berlin, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Petersen, W (corresponding author), Martin Luther Krankenhaus, Caspar Theys Str 27-31, D-14109 Berlin, Germany.",Wolf.Petersen@jsd.de,,,,,,,15,0,2,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-7946,1434-3924,,ARTHROSKOPIE,Arthroskopie,AUG,2024,37,4,,,SI,,284,288,,10.1007/s00142-024-00700-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00142-024-00700-y,,JUL 2024,5,Surgery,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Surgery,C8S3O,,,,,2025-12-29,WOS:001280248900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, clinical data on graft size are limited. Purpose: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. Results: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 +/- 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 +/- 0.7 cm for the ST (P < .05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 +/- 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 +/- 0.7 mm for the ST (P < .05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P < .01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P < .01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P > .05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P < .05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P > .05). Conclusion: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length. However, predicting graft diameter based on thigh or shank circumference was more challenging, with higher BMIs affecting the ability to predict ST more than AHPLT.","[Wierer, Guido] Paracelsus Med Univ, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Salzburg, Austria; [Wierer, Guido] ISAG, Res Unit Orthopaed Sports Med & Injury Prevent, UMIT Hall, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Gwinner, Clemens] Charite, Ctr Musculoskeletal Surg, Berlin, Germany; [Scheffler, Sven] Sporthopaedicum Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Wierer, Guido] Acad Teaching Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Muellner Hauptstr 48, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",Paracelsus Private Medical University; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"Wierer, G (corresponding author), Acad Teaching Hosp, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Muellner Hauptstr 48, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",wierer@gmail.com,,"Gwinner, Clemens/0000-0001-7489-245X",,,,,70,5,9,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

Methods Two types of grafts were harvested from human cadavers: 165 tibialis anterior (TA) and 166 peroneus longus (PL) tendons. According to the two types of sterilization methods (gamma and electron beam irradiation) or the lack of one, and the six types of storage time (one to six months), 36 groups were created. In addition, we created a 1 to 1 native group, which was not sterilized and stored, tested within four hours of collection. Results In the results of tendon type TA compared to TA native group, we observed significant differences at the fifth month of storage for all measured parameters. Load at first break of the frozen values at the fifth month was significantly inferior to the native group (p = 0.034). For strain at first break and strain at maximum load, all sterilization methods were significantly inferior at the fifth month (p = 0.003 to p = 0.009). Maximum load values were significantly superior with E-beam irradiation at the fifth month (p = 0.003), and also significantly higher with gamma irradiation at the fifth month (p = 0.009). Young's modulus showed significantly inferior values in the frozen tendons at the fifth month (p = 0.001 to p = 0.003). In tendon type PL, no significant differences were found for any of the tested parameters compared to the native group. Conclusion Our results indicate that freezing alters mechanical properties via the decrease seen in the ultimate tensile strength. In addition, at the fifth and sixth months of storage, time could notably affect allografts rather than the sterilization procedures.","[Farago, D.; Orlovits, Z.; Kiss, R.

Various grafts have been used, but complications from graft harvesting are not uncommon. This study examined the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with AC joint dislocations repaired with the autogenous anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) to achieve ACCR. Methods: Patients with a Rockwood type III to V AC joint dislocation and magnetic resonance imaging of the disruption of the CC ligaments, as well as the AC capsule, were prospectively recruited. Patients received ACCR using an autogenous AHPLT graft and were evaluated clinically and radiographically pre-operatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Results: A total of 18 patients (mean age, 51 years) were prospectively recruited and received an autogenous AHPLT graft ACCR. Fifteen patients completed clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations at 12 months. The mean Constant score (CS) was 51 preoperatively and 93 at 12 months (P < .005). No significant difference was noted at 12 months between the CS of the injured and contralateral shoulder. The mean American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score at 12 months was 99, and this was not different from the value at any other time point. Loss of reduction occurred in 10 patients (56%), and tunnel widening was observed in 9 (50%), but neither was significantly correlated with functional outcome.

Outcomes included morphology (tissue length, ultrasound-quantified cross-sectional area [CSAUS], and major and minor axes), biomechanics (failure load, ultimate tensile strength [UTS], failure strain, and elastic modulus), and biochemistry (sulfated glycosaminoglycan [sGAG] and hydroxyproline contents). Tissue differences were analyzed using mixed-model regression.Results: There was a range of similarities and differences between tendons and ligaments across outcomes. A key finding relating to potential graft tissue suitability was the comparable failure loads, UTS, CSAUS, sGAG, and hydroxyproline present between hamstring tendons (a standard graft source) and 5 tendons not typically used for grafting: fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis, flexor and extensor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus tendons.Conclusion: This study of lower limb tendons and ligaments has enabled direct comparison of morphological, biomechanical, and biochemical human tissue properties-key factors in the selection of suitable graft tissues. This analysis has identified 6 potential new donor tissues with properties comparable to currently used grafts.Clinical Relevance: This extensive data set reduces the need to utilize data from incompatible sources, which may aid surgical decisions (eg, evidence to expand the range of tendons considered suitable for use as grafts) and may provide congruent design inputs for new biomaterials and computational models. The complete data set has been provided to facilitate further investigations, with the capacity to expand the resource to include additional outcomes and tissues.","[Ashton, Dylan M.; Blaker, Carina L.; Hartnell, Nicholas; Haubruck, Patrick; Liu, Ying; Hefferan, Samantha A.; Little, Christopher B.; Clarke, Elizabeth C.] Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, Kolling Inst, St Leonards, NSW, Australia; [Ashton, Dylan M.; Blaker, Carina L.; Hefferan, Samantha A.; Clarke, Elizabeth C.] Univ Sydney, Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, Murray Maxwell Biomech Lab, Kolling Inst,Sydney Med Sch,Inst Bone & Joint Res, St Leonards, NSW, Australia; [Hartnell, Nicholas] Bone Ligament Tendon Pty Ltd, Bowral, NSW, Australia; [Haubruck, Patrick] Heidelberg Univ Hosp, Ctr Orthoped Trauma Surg & Spinal Cord Injury, Trauma & Reconstruct Surg, Heidelberg Trauma Res Grp, Heidelberg, Germany; [Haubruck, Patrick; Liu, Ying; Little, Christopher B.] Univ Sydney, Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, Raymond Purves Bone & Joint Res Labs, Inst Bone & Joint Res,Kolling Inst,Fac Med & Hlth, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia",University of Sydney; Kolling Institute of Medical Research; Northern Sydney Local Health District; Northern Sydney Local Health District; University of Sydney; Kolling Institute of Medical Research; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Sydney; Kolling Institute of Medical Research; Northern Sydney Local Health District,"Clarke, EC (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, Murray Maxwell Biomech Lab, Kolling Inst,Sydney Med Sch,Inst Bone & Joint Res, St Leonards, NSW, Australia.",elizabeth.clarke@sydney.edu.au,"Haubruck, Patrick/MBH-7351-2025; Little, Christopher B/A-9280-2015; Blaker, Carina/NEU-7301-2025; Clarke, Elizabeth/H-3274-2014; Ashton, Dylan/NZO-0461-2025",", Sam/0000-0002-4610-8258; Little, Christopher B/0000-0002-0353-7634; Blaker, Carina/0000-0003-2264-6702; Ashton, Dylan/0000-0002-8573-3216","Australian Orthopaedic Association; Australian Orthopaedic Association (AOA); Lincoln Centre for Bone and Joint Diseases, the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC); Bone Ligament Tendon (BLT)","Australian Orthopaedic Association; Australian Orthopaedic Association (AOA); Lincoln Centre for Bone and Joint Diseases, the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC); Bone Ligament Tendon (BLT)","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from the Australian Orthopaedic Association (AOA), the Lincoln Centre for Bone and Joint Diseases, the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC), and Bone Ligament Tendon (BLT).",,45,4,4,7,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

This procedure usually requires a gracilis autograft or in some cases an allograft. Siegler et al. reported the mechanical characteristics of the collateral lateral ligaments of the human ankle: 231 +/- 129 N for the ATFL and 307 +/- 142 N for the CFL. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanical properties of different tendon grafts available for ATFL and CFL reconstruction. We hypothesized that the properties of the tested grafts are not inferior to the published values of those of the original ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle. Methods: This was a comparative biomechanical study using 6 cadaver specimens (108 grafts): The biomechanical properties of nine types of grafts were determined using validated tensile testing methods: Gracilis, SemiT, EHL, FHL, Plantaris, Peroneus longus and brevis, TA and TP. The main outcome measure was the comparison of the mechanical properties of each single-stranded tendon with each other and with the known values for the ATFL and CFL, during a uniaxial static rupture test. Results: The mean load to failure for the gracilis was 257.5 +/- 52.9 N. The groups had similar mean values in terms of the maximum load that they could withstand before failing except for the plantaris (137.9 +/- 33.7 N) which was statistically lower than all other tested tendons (p < 0,01). The mean load to failure values of the grafts tested were equal or higher than that of the ATFL and CFL reported by Siegler et al. [14]: 231 +/- 129 N for the ATFL and 307 +/- 142 N for the CFL, while the grafts tested here had mean failure load between 258 +/- 53 N and 464 +/- 136 N. Conclusion: The gracilis, peroneus longus/brevis, EHL, FHL, TA, TP and semiT are legitimate grafts for combined ATFL and CFL reconstruction in the ankle. These tendons have mechanical properties (load to failure, maximum strain at failure and stiffness) that are equal to or higher than the native ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle, except the plantaris. Clinical relevance: This study validates the current use of the gracilis autograft for the anatomical reconstruction of the ATFL and CFL, and even provides proof that other tendons would be suitable for this anatomical reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligament by auto or even allograft under certain conditions.

The most common residual disability, ankle sprain, is characterized by instability along with postural sway. If the supporting structures around a joint become lax, posture stability and balance are also affected. Previous studies have examined muscle stiffness and elasticity and postural sway separately; however, the relationship between these factors is yet unknown. It is well known that the levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen, change in women over the phase of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between the mechanical properties of tissue and balance activity using a non-invasive digital palpation device to determine if they undergo any changes over the menstrual cycle in young women. Sixteen young women with regular menstrual cycles completed the study. Tone, stiffness, and elasticity of the ankle muscles (lateral gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, and tibialis anterior) were measured using a non-invasive digital palpation device. Postural sway was recorded while the participants performed balance tasks during ovulation and menstruation. Significantly greater posture sway characteristics and ankle muscle elasticity were found during ovulation than during menstruation; lower tone and stiffness of the ankle muscles were observed at ovulation (p < 0.05). Additionally, weak-to-strong relationships between ankle muscle mechanical properties and postural sway characteristics were found (p < 0.05). These results suggest the effect of estrogen on human connective tissues. We therefore postulate that estrogen increases joint and muscle laxity and affects posture stability according to the phase of the menstrual cycle.","[Yim, JongEun] Sahmyook Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Seoul, South Korea; [Petrofsk, Jerrold] Touro Univ, Sch Phys Therapy, Henderson, NV USA; [Lee, Haneul] Gachon Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, 191 Hambangmeo Ro, Incheon 21936, South Korea",Sahmyook University; Gachon University,"Lee, H (corresponding author), Gachon Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, 191 Hambangmeo Ro, Incheon 21936, South Korea.",leehaneul84@gachon.ac.kr,"Yim, JongEun/AAE-2930-2020",,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning) [2017R1C1B5017867]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning)","This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning) (No. 2017R1C1B5017867).",,45,32,42,1,21,TOHOKU UNIV MEDICAL PRESS,SENDAI,"2-1, SEIRYO-MACHI, AOBA-KU, SENDAI, MIYAGI 980-8575, JAPAN",0040-8727,1349-3329,,TOHOKU J EXP MED,Tohoku J.

The identification of other tissues that demonstrate equivalent performance to preferred tendons would improve limitations. Hypothesis/Purpose: We compared the biomechanical properties of 4 soft tissue allograft tendons: tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL), and semitendinosus (ST). We hypothesized that allograft properties would be similar when standardized by the looped diameter. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: This study consisted of 2 arms evaluating large and small looped-diameter grafts: experiment A consisted of TA, TP, and PL tendons (n = 47 each) with larger looped diameters of 9.0 to 9.5 mm, and experiment B consisted of TA, TP, PL, and ST tendons (n = 53 each) with smaller looped diameters of 7.0 to 7.5 mm. Each specimen underwent mechanical testing to measure the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile force (UTF), maximal elongation at failure, ultimate tensile stress (UTS), and ultimate tensile strain (UT epsilon). Results: Experiment A: No significant differences were noted among tendons for UTF, maximal elongation at failure, and UTE. UTS was significantly higher for the PL (54 MPa) compared with the TA (44 MPa) and TP (43 MPa) tendons. E was significantly higher for the PL (501 MPa) compared with the TP (416 MPa) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TP and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the TA tendons for all outcomes. Experiment B: All groups exhibited a similar E. UTF was again highest in the PL tendons (2294 N) but was significantly different from only the ST tendons (1915 N). UTE was significantly higher for the ST (0.22) compared with the TA (0.19) and TP (0.19) tendons. Equivalence testing showed that the TA, TP, and PL tendon properties were equivalent or superior to those of the ST tendons. Conclusion: Compared with TA tendons, TP and PL tendons of a given looped diameter exhibited noninferior initial biomechanical strength and stiffness characteristics. ST tendons were mostly similar to TA tendons but exhibited a significantly higher elongation/UTE and smaller cross-sectional area. For smaller looped-diameter grafts, all tissues were noninferior to ST tendons. In contrast to previous findings, PL tendons proved to be equally strong. Clinical Relevance: The results of this study should encourage surgeons to use these soft tissue allografts interchangeably, which is important as the number of ligament reconstructions performed with allografts continues to rise.","[Palmer, Jeremiah E.; Russell, Joseph P.; Grieshober, Jason; Iacangelo, Abigail; Ellison, Benjamin A.; Lease, T.

Ankle inversion-eversion laxity is greater and dynamic postural control is less in women compared with men. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in postural sway and its effects on the neuromuscular activities of the ankle stabilizing muscles during the menstrual cycle in young women. Fourteen young women with regular menstrual cycles participated in this experiment. Postural sway and electromyographic signals of the lateral gastrocnemius, peroneus longus (PL), and tibialis anterior (TA) were recorded while the participants performed eight different balance tasks at ovulation and early follicular phase during one full menstrual cycle. Significantly greater postural sway in the two most difficult balance tasks was observed at ovulation compared to that in the early follicular phase (p < 0.001). A similar pattern was also observed in terms of PL activity, while TA activity was significantly greater in the most difficult balance task at ovulation. In addition, TA-PL co-contraction (TA/PL ratio) was significantly higher at ovulation compared with that in the follicular phase in the two most difficult balance tasks (p < 0.01). Young women could benefit from increased understanding of the varying neuromuscular activation patterns throughout the menstrual cycle. The results of this study suggest that health professionals should be aware of the physiological effects and the shifts in neuromuscular strategies in each menstrual cycle phase in order to prevent increased risk of lower extremity injury.","[Lee, Haneul] Gachon Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Inchon, South Korea; [Yim, JongEun] Sahmyook Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, 815 Hwarangro, Seoul 139742, South Korea",Gachon University; Sahmyook University,"Yim, J (corresponding author), Sahmyook Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, 815 Hwarangro, Seoul 139742, South Korea.",jeyim@syu.ac.kr,"Yim, JongEun/AAE-2930-2020",,Gachon University research fund [GCU-2015-0059],Gachon University research fund,"This research was supported by the Gachon University research fund of 2015 (GCU-2015-0059).

Altered ankle joint arthrokinematics and muscular activity have been cited as potential factors that may lead to an inversion sprain during the aforementioned time periods. However, to date, no study has investigated patterns of muscle activity and 3D joint kinematics simultaneously in a group of subjects with functional instability compared with a noninjured control group during these phases of the gait cycle. Purpose: To compare the patterns of lower limb 3D joint kinematics and electromyographic activity during treadmill walking in a group of subjects with functional instability with those observed in a control group. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Three-dimensional angular velocities and displacements of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, as well as surface electromyography of the rectus femoris, peroneus longus, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles, were recorded simultaneously while subjects walked on a treadmill at a velocity of 4 km/h. Results: Before heel strike, subjects with functional instability exhibited a decrease in vertical foot-floor clearance (12.62 vs 22.84 mm; P <.05), as well as exhibiting a more inverted position of the ankle joint before, at, and immediately after heel strike (1.69 degrees, 2.10 degrees, and -0.09 degrees vs -1.43 degrees, -1.43 degrees, and -2.78 degrees respectively [minus value = eversion]; P <.05) compared with controls. Subjects with functional instability were also observed to have an increase in peroneus longus integral electromyography during the post-heel strike time period (107.91% millisecond vs 64.53% millisecond ; P <.01). Conclusion: The altered kinematics observed in this study could explain the reason subjects with functional instability experience repeated episodes of ankle inversion injury in situations with only slight or no external provocation. It is hypothesized that the observed increase in peroneus longus activity may be the result of a change in preprogrammed feed-forward motor control.","Univ Coll Dublin, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Physiotherapy & Performance Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Delahunt, E (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Physiotherapy & Performance Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.",eamonn.delahunt@ucd.ie,,"Caulfield, Brian/0000-0003-0290-9587; Delahunt, Eamonn/0000-0001-5449-5932; Monaghan, Kenneth/0000-0002-0347-889X",,,,,27,271,341,1,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0363-5465,1552-3365,,AM J SPORT MED,Am.

The biomechanical characteristics of tendons that are less commonly used in knee surgery (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus and medial and lateral half of Achilles tendons) were compared to those of a semitendinosus and gracilis graft harvested from the same 10 multi-organ donors. All right side tendons constituted the study group and were frozen at -80 degrees C and thawed at room temperature 5 times. All left side tendons were frozen at -80 degrees C and thawed at room temperature once. There were 59 tendons in the control group and 56 in the study group. The looped grafts were clamped at one side using a custom-made freeze clamp and loaded until failure on an Instron 4505 testing machine. The average ultimate failure load was not significantly different between the control and the study group (p > 0.05). The failure load of the medial tendon Achilles was the lowest in both study and control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness between the control and study group (p > 0.05). From our study, we conclude that freezing tendons at -80 degrees C and thawing several times does not influence the maximum load, maximum stress, maximum displacement, maximum strain and stiffness. The medial half of the Achilles tendon is clearly the weakest tendon (p < 0.001). These findings show that tendon grafts can be frozen at -80 degrees C and thawed at room temperature several times without altering their biomechanical properties.","[Arnout, Nele; Myncke, Jan; Vanlauwe, Johan; Labey, Luc; Lismont, Daniel; Bellemans, Johan] KUL Univ Hosp, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; University Hospital Leuven,"Arnout, N (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Ghent, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",nelearnout@yahoo.com,"Vanlauwe, Johan/S-7326-2019; Labey, Luc/A-2159-2014","Vanlauwe, Johan/0000-0003-0593-5414; Labey, Luc/0000-0003-0641-4055",,,,,43,27,32,0,9,ACTA MEDICA BELGICA,BRUSSELS,"AVENUE WINSTON CHURCHILL, WINSTON CHURCHILL-LAAN, 11 BOX 30, B-1180 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM",0001-6462,,,ACTA ORTHOP BELG,Acta Orthop.

These are the doubled tibialis anterior (TA), doubled tibialis posterior (TP), and doubled peroneus longus (PL) tendons. Type of Study: A biomechanical evaluation of the properties of the TA, TP, and PL. Methods: Sixteen fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were used for testing. All specimens had the TA, TP, and PL tendons harvested. All specimens were tested in a custom-designed hydraulic testing machine using dry ice clamps. Each tendon was elongated at a rate of 1 mm/s. Load and displacement were recorded with an analog to digital interface board. Stiffness, modulus of elasticity, and stress and strain at failure were calculated. Results: The average tested lengths of the TA, TP, and PL were 37 cm (range, 13-68 cm), 33 cm (range, 7-74 cm), and 42 cm (range, 17-69 cm), respectively. The average cross-sectional areas of the doubled TA, TP, and PL were 38 mm(2) 48 mm(2), and 37 mm(2), respectively. The average failure loads for the doubled TA, TP, and PL tendons were 3,412 N, 3,391 N, and 2,483 N, respectively. The maximum stresses of the 3 tendons did not differ significantly (85-108 Mpa). The TA had the greatest stiffness (344 N/mm), followed by the TP (302 N/nim) and the PL (244 N/mm). Previous authors have documented the biomechanical strength of grafts for ACL reconstruction between 1,700 and 2,900 Newtons. The ultimate tensile strength and stiffness reported for the TA and TP grafts exceeded that for all previously reported grafts, including the doubled semitendinosus-gracilis. Conclusions: The TA, TP, and PL tendons showed excellent biomechanical properties when compared with historical data evaluating other graft sources. The biomechanical properties observed for the TA, TP, and PL were noted in specimens despite an average age of 78.3 years.","Univ S Alabama, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sect Sports Med, Mobile, AL USA; Univ S Alabama, Med Ctr, Orthopaed Biomech Lab, Mobile, AL USA; Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg & Rehabil, Jackson, MS 39216 USA",University of South Alabama; University of South Alabama; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi,"Pearsall, AW (corresponding author), 2451 Fillingim St,MSN 518, Mobile, AL 36617 USA.",apearsal@usouthal.edu,"Russell, George/LQL-0206-2024",,,,,,52,77,98,0,11,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0749-8063,1526-3231,,ARTHROSCOPY,Arthroscopy,DEC,2003,19,10,,,,,1091,1096,,10.1016/j.arthro.2003.10.015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2003.10.015,,,6,Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Orthopedics; Sport Sciences; Surgery,758PJ,14673451,,,,2025-12-29,WOS:000187659100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effect of foot orthoses during gait has also been extensively investigated. However, their effect on neuromuscular control, especially during activities such as jumping, landing, or pivoting, is still unknown. This study investigated the effect of two different kinds of foot orthoses on lower limb's muscle activity during single-leg landings. In all, 28 female athletes were randomly assigned to either prefabricated soft bedding foot orthoses or custom-made sensorimotor foot orthoses and investigated immediately and again after 12 weeks of wearing the orthoses. The activity of each muscle was normalized to the overall activity of all analyzed muscles. This enables us to obtain the influence of the corresponding muscle on motor control. Muscle activity was analyzed during the flight and stabilization phases of landing. The sensorimotor foot orthoses increased the influence of peroneus longus and semitendinosus muscles and decreased the influence of tibialis anterior muscle, predominantly during the stabilization phase. Soft bedding foot orthoses, on the other hand, increased the influence of vastus medialis and decreased the influence of tibialis anterior muscle, mainly during the flight phase. Furthermore, motor control was altered during the flight and stabilization phases after long-term use, independently of the foot orthoses worn. In conclusion, sensorimotor foot orthoses may provide afferent feedback differently to soft bedding foot orthoses. Future clinical studies should investigate whether foot orthoses have positive effects on knee pain and the potential to reduce overload knee injuries during sports activities.","[Kerkhoff, Annette; Peikenkamp, Klaus] Munster Univ Appl Sci, Fac Engn Phys, Biomech Res Lab, Burgerkamp 3, D-48565 Steinfurt, Germany; [Kerkhoff, Annette; Wagner, Heiko] Univ Munster, Movement Sci, Inst Sport & Exercise Sci, Munster, Germany; [Nagel, Arne; Moeller, Michael] Orthopadieschuhtech Moller, Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Kerkhoff, A (corresponding author), Munster Univ Appl Sci, Fac Engn Phys, Biomech Res Lab, Burgerkamp 3, D-48565 Steinfurt, Germany.",a.kerkhoff@fh-muenster.de,"Wagner, Heiko/D-9677-2013","Wagner, Heiko/0000-0002-5470-5044; Kerkhoff, Annette/0000-0003-4627-6566",,,,,54,2,3,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2509-3142,2509-3150,,GER J EXERC SPORT RE,Ger.

Sudden ankle inversion tests have been used to investigate whether the onset of peroneal muscle activity is delayed in patients with chronically unstable ankle joints. Before interpreting test results of latency times in patients with chronic ankle instability and healthy subjects, the reliability of these measures must be first demonstrated. Objective: To investigate the test-retest reliability of variables measured during a sudden ankle inversion movement in standing subjects with healthy ankle joints. Design: Validation study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: 15 subjects with healthy ankle joints (30 ankles). Intervention(s): Subjects stood on an ankle inversion platform with both feet tightly fixed to independently moveable trapdoors. An unexpected sudden ankle inversion of 50 degrees was imposed. Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured latency and motor response times and electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle, along with the time and angular position of the first and second decelerating moments, the mean and maximum inversion speed, and the total inversion time. Correlation coefficients and standard error of measurements were calculated. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.17 for the electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle (standard error of measurement = 2.7 milliseconds) to 0.89 for the maximum inversion speed (standard error of measurement = 34.8 milliseconds). Conclusions: The reliability of the latency and motor response times of the peroneus longus muscle, the time of the first and second decelerating moments, and the mean and maximum inversion speed was acceptable in subjects with healthy ankle joints and supports the investigation of the reliability of these measures in subjects with chronic ankle instability. The lower reliability of the electromechanical delay of the peroneus longus muscle and the angular positions of both decelerating moments calls the use of these variables into question.","Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Phys Therapy, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Eechaute, C (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Phys Therapy, Laarbeeklaan 101, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium.",christophe.eechaute@belgacom.net,,,,,,,28,20,29,0,2,NATL ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOC INC,DALLAS,"2952 STEMMONS FREEWAY, DALLAS, TX 75247 USA",1062-6050,1938-162X,,J ATHL TRAINING,J.

Design: Fifty-four ACL-injured participants were scanned in both knees at baseline using 3T MR T1 rho and T2 mapping. Participants also completed Knee-injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Marx activity level questionnaires at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year after reconstruction. The difference between cartilage T1 rho or T2 of the injured and contralateral knee (side-to-side difference, SSD) was calculated to account for physiological variations among patients. Linear regression models were built to evaluate the association between the baseline SSD T1 rho or T2 and KOOS or Marx at all time points. Results: Higher baseline SSD T1 rho posterolateral tibia (pLT) was associated with worse KOOS in all subscales except symptoms at baseline, worse KOOS pain at 6-months, and worse KOOS in all subscales except sports function at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T2 femoral trochlea (TrF) was associated with worse KOOS activities of daily living (ADL) at 1-year. Higher baseline SSD T1 rho pLT was associated with lower Marx activity level at 1-year. More severe cartilage lesions, as assessed by Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS), was significantly associated with worse KOOS pain at 6-months and 1-year. Conclusion: T1 rho and T2 of cartilage after ACL injury were associated with KOOS after injury and both KOOS and Marx after reconstruction. Such associations may help clinicians stratify outcomes post-injury, and thus, improve patient management. (C) 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we conducted this study to establish reference intervals for Vietnamese pregnant women.MethodsFrom June 2023 to Augst 2023, blood samples from 879 eligible pregnant women were run on DxH 900 hematology analyzer and ACL TOP 550 coagulation analyzer. The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference intervals.ResultsPT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count. The reference intervals for PT (seconds), APTT (seconds), fibrinogen (mg/dL), in the first trimester were 10.30-12.88, 25.40-35.46, 280.28-559.00, in the second trimester were 9.80-11.66, 24.05-33.23, 347.75-593.35, in the third trimester were 9.60-11.40, 23.40-31.80, 330.28-628.56, respectively. The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (x 109/L), RBC (x 1012/L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (x 109/L) in the first trimester were 6.33-15.24, 3.73-5.32, 10.33-13.95, 32.22-42.29, 169.66-413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99-15.55, 3.33-4.98, 9.71-13.17, 30.26-40.07, 172.34-372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22-14.14, 3.54-4.98, 9.80-13.97, 31.11-42.70, 151.30-417.14, respectively.ConclusionsMost established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.Trial registrationThis study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05929326.","[Pham, Huan Nguyen; Huynh, Nghiem Xuan; Pham, Phuc Nguyen Huu; Dang, Dung Ngoc Yen; Cao, Long Thang; Huynh, Diem Minh; Thoi, Hau Thi Thu] Hung Vuong Hosp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Le, Oanh Hoang; Beaupha, Suzanne Monivong Cheanh] Univ Med & Pharm Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Beaupha, Suzanne Monivong Cheanh] Cho Ray Hosp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Hochiminh City University of Medicine & Pharmacy; Cho Ray Hospital,"Pham, HN (corresponding author), Hung Vuong Hosp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",huanpmd@gmail.com,"Pham, Huan/LUY-2779-2024","Pham, Huan/0009-0000-3256-8328; Huynh, Nghiem/0009-0003-4125-2298",Not applicable.,Not applicable.,Not applicable.,,11,3,4,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2393,,BMC PREGNANCY CHILDB,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,NOV 11,2023,23,1,,,,,,,788,10.1186/s12884-023-06106-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12884-023-06106-2,,,9,Obstetrics & Gynecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Obstetrics & Gynecology,Y2HP3,37951881,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-29,WOS:001103532000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Blood specimens were obtained for complete blood count (CBC), in conjunction with the identification of IgG for aCL and anti-beta 2GPI utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the assessment of LA through the Diluted Russell Viper Venom Time (dRVVT).ResultsThe prevalence of LA, aCL, and anti-beta 2GPI (IgG) in SCD patients at steady state was 29.4%, 16.3%, and 5.4%, respectively. A correlation was found between LA and chronic leg ulcers, history of thrombosis, decreased platelet counts (PLT), and increased mean platelet volume (MPV) in SCD patients. Furthermore, aCL (IgG) exhibited a significant association with chronic leg ulcers, history of thrombosis, elevated Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, increased red blood cell count (RBC), and higher red cell distribution width (RDW) in SCD patients at steady state phase.ConclusionThis research elucidates the incidence of LA and aCL in SCD patients during steady state, linking these autoantibodies to hematological parameters and clinical complications; thus, prospective assessments of aPL in SCD patients are essential.","[Almorish, Mohammed A.

The demand for ACL allografts has increased in the last decade, and postoperative results are promising. This is visible in the increase in allograft use from 2% (between 1986 and 1996) to 14% (between 1996 and 2001), and it further increased around 2007 as its number reached 20-30% in the US. Orthopedic surgeons do not have to struggle with the problems of the donor site, size and the number of the grafts. In the case of multiple ligament reconstruction or ACL revision operations, the surgeons cannot remove enough tendons from the patients to replace the injured ligaments. Our work can help operating surgeons in the selection of proper allografts based on precise mechanical properties provided by our statistically evaluated measurements. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the endurance properties of four types of tendons caused by freezing and gamma irradiation. Four types of grafts were harvested: quadriceps, semitendinosus + gracilis, tibialis anterior, and peroneus longus. These were put into three groups: Group A was the control group, tested without freezing or irradiation. Grafts in Group B were frozen and irradiated (target dose: 21 kGy), while grafts in Group C were again frozen and irradiated (target dose: 42 kGy). Maximum load, tensile modulus, tensile strength, strain at maximum force and fracture strain were calculated from the force-elongation graphs of cyclic load tests. The higher gamma irradiation dose (Group C) significantly decreased the strains at tensile strength of the quadriceps tendons (p= 0.0004-0.0237), compared to the other two groups. In the case of the quadricep tendons (p= 0.0151), there is a significant decrease in Young's modulus after gamma irradiation with the dose of 42 kGy. According to the results of the study, the tibialis anterior and the peroneus longus are recommended in ACL reconstruction when gamma irradiation is required, while quadricep tendons, which are usually used for an autograph, are not suitable for allograft reconstruction after gamma irradiation from the viewpoint of mechanical properties.","[Farago, Denes; Kiss, Rita Maria] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mechatron Opt & Mech Engn Informat, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Farago, Denes; Szebenyi, Gabor] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Biomech Res Ctr, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Szebenyi, Gabor; Temesi, Tamas] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Polymer Engn, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Pap, Karoly] Uzsoki Hosp, Orthopaed & Trauma Dept, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary; [Pap, Karoly] Semmeweis Univ, Dept Traumatol, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Budapest University of Technology & Economics; Semmelweis University,"Szeb‚nyi, G (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Biomech Res Ctr, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.;Szeb‚nyi, G (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Polymer Engn, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.",farago@mogi.bme.hu; szebenyi@pt.bme.hu; temesit@pt.bme.hu; rita.kiss@mogi.bme.hu; drpapster@gmail.com,"Kiss, Rita/G-4315-2015; Temesi, Tam s/K-9172-2017","Kiss, Rita/0000-0003-3607-8435; Temesi, Tam s/0000-0002-4869-7498; Szeb‚nyi, G bor/0000-0003-3174-0661","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation O ffice (NKFIH) [OTKA K116189]; UNKP-18-3 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities of Hungary [UNKP-18-3-I-BME-183]; Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacitie","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation O ffice (NKFIH); UNKP-18-3 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities of Hungary; Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacitie","This work was supported by Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation O ffice (NKFIH) through grant OTKA K116189 (Research project entitled In vitro investigation of human tissues and definition of their mechanical materials models), by the Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities in the framework of the Biotechnology research area of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-BIO) and by the UNKP-18-3 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities of Hungary under grant no.

This combined trauma, which is often accompanied by additional ligament lesions, originates from a knee dislocation. While the conservative treatment of this complex instability is abandoned, the operative procedures are not yet standardised. The timing of the cruciate ligament reconstruction depends on the additional injuries, but generally the postprimary treatment is performed. Autografts and allografts, which can be also combined, are available for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments. The arthroscopic assisted operation starts with the drilling of all tibial and femoral tunnels using standard ACL and PCL arthroscopic instruments. The PCL is positioned after the graft has been transported into the joint through an anterolateral port, the ACL graft is positioned through the tibial drill hole and both are anchored first on the femoral and then on the tibial site i.e. with interference screws. In the postoperative rehabilitation neither immobilisation nor brace are used and progressive range of motion is allowed. The arthroscopic assisted reconstructions of the ACL and increasingly of the PCL are becoming standard procedures, but the technically difficult combined ACL/PCL reconstruction is restricted to a small number of arthroscopists. The first clinical results demonstrate, that the arthroscopic operation is comparable to the open reconstruction.","Tech Univ Munich, Abt Sportorthopadie, D-80809 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Martinek, V (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Abt Sportorthopadie, Connollystr 32, D-80809 Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,21,5,7,0,0,JOHANN AMBROSIUS BARTH VERLAG,HEIDELBERG,"IM WEIHER 10, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0044-409X,,,ZBL CHIR,Zent.bl.

Muscles' neuromuscular variables such as amplitude (EMGAMP) and onset (EMGONSET) have been used to explain kinematics. The study aimed to evaluate the correlation between two EMG variables of seven trunk and lower limb muscles and 3D kinematics during two tasks. Eighteen physically-active women participated in the study. The following variables were obtained during singleleg squat and anterior step-down: (i) EMGAMP and EMGONSET of fibularis longus (FL), tibialis anterior (TA), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), gluteus medius (GMED), ipsilateral (OB_IL) and contralateral (OB_CL) external obliques and (ii) knee abduction and hip adduction angular displacement (initial angle - angle at 60 degrees of knee flexion). Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between kinematic and EMG variables. Greater knee abduction was correlated with delayed TAONSET, GMEDONSET and OB_ILONSET during step-down. Greater hip adduction was correlated with lower VMAMP, BFAMP and delayed VMONSET during step-down. Although taskspecific, these results suggest that EMGONSET may influence knee abduction, while both EMGONSET and EMGAMP may affect hip adduction. The identification of muscle activation patterns in relation to kinematics may help the development of injury prevention and rehabilitation programs.","[Rabello, Rodrigo; Brunetti, Claudia; Sforza, Chiarella] Univ Milan, Dept Biomed Sci Hlth, Milan, Italy; [Bertozzi, Filippo] Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, Milan, Italy; [Bertozzi, Filippo] Politecn Milan, E4Sport Lab, Milan, Italy; [Rodrigues, Rodrigo] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Inst Educ, Rio Grande, Brazil; [Sforza, Chiarella] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Biomed Salute, Via Mangiagalli 31, I-20133 Milan, MI, Italy",University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande; University of Milan,"Sforza, C (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Biomed Salute, Via Mangiagalli 31, I-20133 Milan, MI, Italy.",rodrigo.rabello@unimi.it; claudia.brunetti@unimi.it; filippo.bertozzi@polimi.it; rodrigo.rabello@unimi.it; chiarella.sforza@unimi.it,"; Sforza, Chiarella/C-3008-2015; Bertozzi, Filippo/W-2550-2018","Rabello, Roigo/0000-0003-0665-1835; Sforza, Chiarella/0000-0001-6532-6464;",,,,,42,3,3,1,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1050-6411,1873-5711,,J ELECTROMYOGR KINES,J.

The crowding degree of fish swarm was introduced to construct the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACOA), and the maximum and minimum ant system (MMAS) and ant colony algorithm based on variation features (VF-based ACA) were introduced to compare with ACOA. Besides, ACOA was applied to the MRI diagnosis of 98 patients with PLC injuries. Then the number of Degree I, Degree II, and Degree III in PLC patients were compared. The results showed that the iteration times and running time of the optimal solution were obtained by ACOA when the number of cities was 10, which were compared with those obtained by MMAS and VF-based ACA with no great differences (P > 0.05), and the iteration times and running time of ACOA were greater than those of MMAS and VF-based ACA when the number of cities was 50 (P < 0.05). There were 73 patients with PLC injuries involved 2 or more structures, 11 patients with PLC injuries only involved the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and 7 patients with PLC injuries only involved the popliteal tendon (PLT). The injury rates of LCL, medial collateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and PLT were 87.02%, 51.33%, 72.45%, 41.75%, and 84.06%, respectively. The number of patients with PLC injuries combined with Grade I of LCL, PCL, ACL, PCL, biceps femoris tendon, and PLT was higher than that of patients with Grade II and III (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ACOA was much better than MMAS and VF-based ACA in dealing with complex work, which effectively improved the ergodicity of search and reduced the running time. There were more common in PLC injuries combined with LCL, PCL, ACL, PCL, and PLT, MRI images based on ACOA could clearly show the degree of ligament and tendon injuries.","[Song, Ziyu] Changsha Med Univ, Coll Phys Educ & Hlth, Changsha 410219, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Bowen] Tianjin Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Changsha Medical University; Tianjin University,"Song, ZY (corresponding author), Changsha Med Univ, Coll Phys Educ & Hlth, Changsha 410219, Hunan, Peoples R China.",ziyuzong@sina.com,"Song, Ziyu/MZX-0421-2025",,,,,,18,8,8,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4720,1468-0394,,EXPERT SYST,Expert Syst.,MAY,2023,40,4,,,,,,,e12849,10.1111/exsy.12849,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12849,,MAR 2022,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,D8AJ8,,,,,2025-12-29,WOS:000767850500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assessed the ability of healthy athletes to reweight somaesthetic signals during postural perturbations on different surfaces. Thirty-five young (16 +/- 1 years), healthy, elite handball players participated in this cross-sectional study. Proprioceptive reweighting was evaluated via vibration of the triceps surae and lumbar muscles on firm and foam surfaces. Postural variables and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius (GM), semitendinosus (ST) and fibularis longus (FL) were recorded during the PRE (10 s), VIBRATION (20 s) and POST (20 s) periods. Ankle proprioception was predominantly used on the firm compared to foam support. However, two opposing behaviours were observed: a rigid strategy in which reliance on ankle proprioception increased on the foam, and a plastic strategy that involved a proximal shift of proprioceptive reliance (p < 0.001). The plastic strategy was associated with a more effective recovery of balance after vibration cessation (p < 0.05). ST activation was higher during POST in the rigid strategy and did not return to the PRE level (p < 0.05) whereas it did in the plastic strategy. Proprioceptive strategies for postural control are highly variable and future studies should evaluate their contribution to injury.","[Picot, Brice] French Handball Federat, Creteil, France; [Picot, Brice] French Soc Sports Physiotherapits SFMKS Lab, Pierrefite Sur Seine, France; [Picot, Brice; Forestier, Nicolas] Savoie Mt Blanc Univ, Chambery, France; [Picot, Brice; Forestier, Nicolas] Interuniv Lab Human Movement Biol LIBM EA 7424, Chambery, France; [Picot, Brice; Remy-Neris, Olivier] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France; [Remy-Neris, Olivier] Brest CHRU, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Morvan Hosp, Brest, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; CHU Brest,"Picot, B (corresponding author), French Handball Federat, Creteil, France.",b.picot@ffhandball.net,"Picot, Brice/JMC-6680-2023","Picot, Brice/0000-0003-2694-2998",,,,,42,11,13,0,12,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0304-3940,1872-7972,,NEUROSCI LETT,Neurosci.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune disease characterized by multiorgan involvement. Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers. The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE. However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive. In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE. Methods. Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE. White blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (HB), platelet count (PLT), IgG, IgA, IgM, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), RF, anti-cardiolipin (Acl), ANA, AnuA, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, 2-GPI, urinalysis, and 24h urine protein were measured by standard laboratory techniques. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index scores were evaluated accordingly. Results. The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (P=0.0011). Elevated serum anti-GAPDH was correlated with increased SLEDAI-2K (P=0.017), ESR, IgG, and IgM and associated with increased intracranial pressure and incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, but it was protective for seizure disorder incidence. Conclusions. Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity. It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice.","[Sun, Jingjing; Jia, Jingjing; Xie, Qizhi; Peng, Sijia; Yi, Li] Peking Univ, Dept Neurol, Shenzhen Hosp, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Xue; Zhou, Haotian; Sun, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Peoples Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoyun] Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Inst Analyt Chem, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoyun] Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Synthet & Funct Biomol Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qingwen] Peking Univ, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Shenzhen Hosp, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; Peking University; Peking University; Peking University,"Yi, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Neurol, Shenzhen Hosp, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Sun, XL (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Peoples Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, QW (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Rheumatol & Immunol, Shenzhen Hosp, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",sunxiaolin_sxl@126.com; wqw_sw@163.com; yilitj@hotmail.com,"; Sun, Xiaolin/ACX-5286-2022; ZHOU, Haotian/IZD-9691-2023","Sun, Jingjing/0000-0002-3180-3960; Sun, Xiaolin/0000-0001-9709-1532; Wang, Qingwen/0000-0003-4303-8271","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81671602, 81801619]; Sanming Project of Shenzhen [SZSM201612009, SZSM201812096]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Project [201401027]; Beijing Nova Program [Z171100001117025]; Peking University Clinical Medicine + X Project; Peking University People's Hospital Scientific Research Development Funds [RDY2017-05]",Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sanming Project of Shenzhen; Shenzhen Science and Technology Project; Beijing Nova Program(Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission); Peking University Clinical Medicine + X Project; Peking University People's Hospital Scientific Research Development Funds,"This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (81671602 and 81801619), Sanming Project of Shenzhen (SZSM201612009 and SZSM201812096), Shenzhen Science and Technology Project (201401027), Beijing Nova Program (Z171100001117025), Peking University Clinical Medicine + X Project for Joint Investigation of Youth, and Peking University People's Hospital Scientific Research Development Funds (RDY2017-05).",,31,15,17,1,14,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2314-8861,2314-7156,,J IMMUNOL RES,J Immunol.

Available evidence suggests that acute bouts of neuromuscular and endurance exercise deteriorate postural control. High-intensity endurance training has been successfully applied in different populations. Thus, it seemed valuable to examine the acute effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on neuromuscular performance in seniors and young adults. Objective: The acute impact of a HIIT session on balance performance and muscle activity after exercise cessation and during post-exercise recovery was examined in young and old adults. We intended to investigate whether a transient exercise-induced fall-risk may occur in both groups. Methods: 20 healthy seniors (age 70 (SD 4) years) and young adults (age 27 (SD 3) years) were examined on 3 days. After exhaustive ramp-like treadmill testing in order to determine maximal heart rate (HR max) on the first day, either a 4 x 4 min HIIT at 90% of HR max or a control condition (CON) was randomly performed on the second and third day, respectively. Balance performance (postural sway) was assessed during single limb stance with open eyes (SLEO) and double limb stance with closed eyes (DLEC). EMG was recorded for the soleus (SOL), anterior tibialis (TIB), gastrocnemius (GM) and peroneus longus (PL) muscles at the dominant leg. All measures were collected before, immediately as well as 10, 30 and 45 min after HIIT and CON, respectively. Results: Compared to CON, HIIT induced significant increases of postural sway immediately after exercise cessation during SLEO in both groups (adults: p < 0.001, Delta = +25% sway; seniors: p = 0.007, Delta = +15% sway). Increased sway during DLEC was only found for seniors immediately and 10 min after HIIT (post: p = 0.003, Delta = +14% sway, 10 min post: p = 0.004, Delta = +18% sway). Muscle activity was increased during SLEO for TIB until 10 min post in seniors (0.008 < p < 0.03) and immediately after HIIT in adults (p < 0.001). Conclusion: HIIT training may cause an acute 'open-fall-window' with a transient impairment of balance performance for at least 10 min after exercise cessation in both groups. Occluded vision in seniors seems to prolong this period up to 30 min. Thus, the advantage of HIIT with regard to time efficiency seems debatable when considering transient HIIT-induced impairments of neuromuscular function. (C) 2014 S.

Landing from a jump is one common mechanism of ankle injury, yet few researchers have explored the role of visual cues and anticipatory muscle contractions, which may influence ankle stability, in lateral jumping maneuvers. Objective: To examine muscle-activation strategies between FAI and stable ankles under a lateral load and to evaluate the differences in muscle activation in participants with FAI and participants with stable ankles when they were unable to anticipate the onset of lateral loads during eyes-open versus eyes-closed conditions. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Controlled laboratory setting. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 40 people participated: 20 with FAI and 20 healthy, uninjured, sex-and age-matched persons (control group). Intervention(s): Participants performed a 2-legged lateral jump off a platform onto a force plate set to heights of 35 cm or 50 cm and then immediately jumped for maximal height. They performed jumps in 2 conditions (eyes open, eyes closed) and were unaware of the jump height when their eyes were closed. Main Outcome Measure(s): Amplitude normalized electromyographic (EMG) area (%), peak (%), and time to peak in the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles were measured. Results: Regardless of the eyes-open or eyes-closed condition, participants with FAI had less preparatory TA (t(158) = 2.22, P = .03) and PL (t(158) = 2.09, P = .04) EMG area and TA (t(158) = 2.45, P = .02) and PL (t(158) = 2.17, P = .03) peak EMG than control-group participants. Conclusions: By removing visual cues, unanticipated lateral joint loads occurred simultaneously with decreased muscle activity, which may reduce dynamic restraint capabilities in persons with FAI. Regardless of visual impairment and jump height, participants with FAI exhibited PL and TA inhibition, which may limit talonavicular stability and intensify lateral joint surface compression and pain.","[Rosen, Adam] Univ Georgia, Dept Kinesiol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Swanik, Charles; Knight, Christopher; Kaminski, Thomas W.] Univ Delaware, Dept Kinesiol & Appl Physiol, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Thomas, Stephen] Univ Penn, McKay Orthopaed Res Lab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Glutting, Joseph] Univ Delaware, Sch Educ, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Delaware; University of Pennsylvania; University of Delaware,"Rosen, A (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, 330 River Rd, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",adamrosen84@gmail.com,"; Rosen, Adam/G-5982-2018; Swanik, Charles/C-4377-2014","Thomas, Stephen/0000-0003-0910-9945; Rosen, Adam/0000-0002-1204-2289;",,,,,49,27,35,1,23,NATL ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOC INC,DALLAS,"2952 STEMMONS FREEWAY, DALLAS, TX 75247 USA",1062-6050,1938-162X,,J ATHL TRAINING,J.
